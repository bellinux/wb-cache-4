5|$|The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} was {{the most}} recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrical}} and physiological properties of ion channels are experimentally measured by inserting the channel into a lipid membrane separating two baths containing solutions of specific concentrations. A constant electrostatic bias is applied across the channel by immersing the electrodes {{in the two}} baths. Formulating boundary conditions that accurately represent these contact regions may require enormously large bath regions and is a challenging task. Beyond a Debye length from the membrane the electrostatic potential and ion densities do not vary appreciably. This assumption has been supported {{by the results of}} continuum results presented earlier. For typical salt concentrations used in ion channel simulations, the Debye length is of the order of 10 Å. Using the assumption, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the potential at the two domain boundary planes that are <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the channel, taking care that these planes are sufficiently far from the membrane.|$|E
25|$|Named to honour the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, {{although}} mechanically {{very similar}} to the 5000QV, sported considerable restyling. Notably, restyling, enlargement and extension of the rear 'air-box' intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of debossed ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely, this allowed the airboxes, located behind the radiators to be rotated from a <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> a longitudinal position, allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear-end were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.|$|E

Careful measurement of the star's position allows this angular movement, known as proper motion, to be calculated. Vega's proper motion is [...] (mas) per year in right ascension—the celestial equivalent of longitude—and [...] in declination, which is equivalent to a change in latitude. The net proper motion of Vega is 327.78mas/y, which results in angular movement of a degree every 11,000years.|$|E
500|$|In mathematics, {{potential}} flow around a circular cylinder is a classical solution [...] for {{the flow of}} an inviscid, incompressible fluid [...] around a cylinder that is <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the flow. [...] Far from the cylinder, the flow is unidirectional and uniform. [...] The flow has no vorticity and thus the velocity field is irrotational and can be modeled as a {{potential flow}}. [...] Unlike a real fluid, this solution indicates a net zero drag on the body, a result known as d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E

[...] Marginal crevasses form {{from the edge of}} the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls. [...] Marginal crevasses are usually largely <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> flow. [...] Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund. [...] Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{identify}} and characterize our native chicken breeds we used two approaches, {{one of them is}} genetic and the other concerns with the immunological status of the chickens. In this study, the first 539 bases of the mtDNA D-loop region of two Egyptian native breeds (Fayoumi and Dandarawi, from El-Fayoum research station) were amplified and sequenced. The alignment results showed an approximate tandem repeat of 60 -base units with the first 34 nucleotides being exact. These 34 -base units were completely identical and conserved in both Egyptian and GenBank database samples. The multiple alignment results showed also that there are three transversions specific for the Egyptian breeds only. Two of them are not specific for certain breed since both of the two breeds showed the normal and mutated nucleotide. The third transversions seems to be specific to Egyptian Dandarawi breed only. The first mutation site is at the position (457) where Adenine nucleotide <b>transversed</b> <b>to</b> Cytosine nucleotide.
