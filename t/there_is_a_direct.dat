40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were to investigate the effect of emotional honesty, interpersonal skills, task structure and directive behaviour on leadership effectiveness. This research was conducted at Vocational Schools (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan: SMK) in Medan in 2010 by using survey with 132 principals as population and the sample of 60 principals as respondents who were selected by applying proportional random sampling technique. The hypotheses were tested by using path analysis.

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem {{does not have any}} of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E

5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> {{connection between the two}} halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

5|$|Route 124 {{crosses the}} Passaic River and {{runs along the}} border of Millburn, Essex County {{to the north and}} Summit, Union County, coming to a large {{interchange}} with the Route 24 freeway and CR649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects Essex CR608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR512 near an interchange with Route 24. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.|$|E
