25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
