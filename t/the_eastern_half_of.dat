5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|Gondor {{had long}} been {{threatened}} by the nearby realm of Mordor, and in 3018 the Dark Lord Sauron began the War of the Ring, attacking the ruined city of Osgiliath that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith.

5|$|In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 {{video cameras}} to the {{existing}} 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge {{the size of the}} animals' population. A recent survey has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta.

US-50 both enters and exits Utah concurrent with US-6, however the two routes are separate through {{the center of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up {{a large majority of}} people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain.

5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, {{the formation of}} a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans began in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> northern China by 2000 BC, but {{is almost certainly}} much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region {{until well into the}} 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
