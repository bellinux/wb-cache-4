50|$|A large army staging {{camp was}} {{located at the}} site between 1943 and 1945 during World War II. As part of this development, the bandstand was sold for removal and many buildings, {{including}} a post office for soldiers at the camp, were erected. After the war, these were removed {{with the exception of}} the post office building, which was relocated to the western edge of the park, and is used by the Scouts, who have considerably altered and extended it over the years. Thiess Brothers were engaged to restore the park to its pre-war condition, though the bandstand was not replaced. In 1952 Harry Oakman, then Manager of Brisbane parks, planted <b>tallowwoods</b> along the memorial drive to replace trees that had died or been removed.|$|R

50|$|The reserve's {{vegetation}} {{consists of}} <b>tallowwood,</b> Grey Gum, Brush Box, Queensland Blue Gum and White Mahogany with small instances of Rainforest. The reserve {{is prone to}} potentially catastrophic bushfires during the summer months; given many residences (some in the multi-million range) border the dry bushland. The Brisbane City Council actively practices anti-bushfire methods, such as sacrificial back burning. This involves burning selected sections of bushland to inhibit the spread of potentially damaging fires {{in the event of}} an emergency. The reserve is also dotted with a number of fire trails.|$|E
50|$|The main {{floors of}} the {{residence}} are either Australian wood or Australian white marble from southern New South Wales, {{with the exception of}} the entrance hall, which has the same Australian white marble in a checkered pattern with Belgian black marble. Additionally, sandstone paves the way to the solarium, and jarrah parquetry is utilized for the main floor, with <b>tallowwood</b> parquetry for the upper floor. Finally, linoleum on pine flooring is used for flooring service areas. Outside, the roof is Bangor slate, with entrance columns and other stone adornments made of Hawkesbury sandstone.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} funnel-web {{is found}} in eastern Australia from South East Queensland to the Hunter River in New South Wales. This and the southern tree funnel-web (Hadronyche cerberea) {{are the only two}} species of funnel-web that live predominantly in trees. It lives in rotting logs, branches and hollow furrows and pipes of trees, particularly <b>tallowwood</b> (Eucalyptus microcorys), as well as in epiphytes. They have been recorded in trees 30 m (100 ft) above the ground. Roving males are encountered after rain and at night between late October and early February. They seek shelter during the day.|$|E
50|$|The western section, from Hampton {{to the end}} of a spur of the Great Dividing Range, {{was also}} {{developed}} to facilitate the harvesting of timber. Prior to European settlement the rich volcanic soil on the ridge supported a sub-tropical rainforest, which contained timbers that were in high demand, including red cedar, <b>tallowwood</b> and hoop pine. These timbers were used in some homes constructed in the area at the time. The road later provided access to cleared land that was used for dairying and beef cattle grazing. This section provides access to Ravensbourne National Park, which preserves a remnant of the rainforest.|$|E
50|$|Two {{watercourses}} named Hidden and Finches Creeks flow to {{the east}} out of the reserve. It was dedicated as a Flora Reserve in 1963. Flora Reserve is the highest protected status for forest areas in the Australian National Parks system. Prior to 1963 the area was classified as a Forest Reserve. The fringes of the reserve were logged for red cedar, hoop pine and white beech. Bullock teams were used to drag out the logs. The reserve is composed of virgin old growth sub-tropical rain forest and hardwood species - flooded gum, <b>tallowwood,</b> ironbark and white mahogany.|$|E
50|$|It is a modest, single-storeyed, exposed-frame timber building, {{constructed}} of pit-sawn and hand-dressed local beech and wall and ceiling linings, red cedar joinery, <b>tallowwood</b> and wall plates and hardwoods (wall framing and roof structure), and set on low timber stumps. It has a steeply pitched roof, with corrugated iron covering the original shingle battens, and two dormer {{windows on the}} southwest side, opening from an attic space. The four-roomed core is surrounded by verandahs with simple chamfered posts supporting the verandah roofs, which extend from the main roof at a different pitch. These are unlined, and the early shingle battens are visible. French doors open from each room onto the verandahs.|$|E
50|$|These {{habitats}} {{are vulnerable}} to ongoing clearance for agriculture and urban development and by fires, while introduced species both weeds and animals, and pollution of water supplies threaten the indigenous wildlife. However, controlled logging of <b>tallowwood,</b> Sydney blue gum, spotted gum, blackbutt, and flooded gum does sustain large areas of these indigenous trees as well as formally protected areas such as those mentioned above and Royal National Park near to Sydney which contains {{a number of the}} different habitats described here. Urban areas in this ecoregion include Sydney and Brisbane while resort areas like North Stradbroke Island and Ballina attract visitors to the coast.|$|E
50|$|The Hornibrook Highway Bridge was a 2.685 km long {{timber and}} {{concrete}} bridge that spanned Hays Inlet and Bramble Bay between Clontarf and Brighton, linking Sandgate to Redcliffe. It had identical rendered concrete portals at each end, and two rises along its length which permit small boats to pass underneath.The bridge construction comprised a timber superstructure supported by reinforced concrete piers with three concrete piles of varying depths. The superstructure had substantial round ironbark girders on corbels, with girders supporting large section ironbark and <b>tallowwood</b> sawn decking. The decking {{was covered with}} coarse aggregate bitumen, and had concrete kerb edging. At each end, the first spans of the superstructure were constructed in ribbed reinforced concrete to protect the bridge from termites and fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{range is}} from Mittagong in the Southern Highlands {{north to the}} Queensland border. It is {{widespread}} in the Blue Mountains, with a somewhat scattered distribution elsewhere. It is found on sandstone soils in the Blue Mountains, and red clay loams elsewhere. In the Blue Mountains, it is found on steep slopes and ridges, on southern or eastern aspects, from elevations of 600 to 1200 m and annual rainfall of 900 to 1400 mm. The habitat is open eucalypt forest, and associated species include silvertop ash (E. sieberi), narrow-leaved peppermint (E. radiata), broad-leaved peppermint (E. dives), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), Blaxland's stringybark (E. blaxlandii), snappy gum (E. racemosa), messmate stringybark (E. obliqua), <b>tallowwood</b> (E. microcorys), and New England blackbutt (E. andrewsii).|$|E
50|$|The creek {{begins as}} a {{stormwater}} drain, then runs in the open through the Coxs Creek Wetland, a 1.84 ha reserve containing significant remnant bushland including some Cooks River Castlereagh Ironbark Forest habitat. Including tree specimens of mugga ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon), narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), broad-leaved ironbark (E. fibrosa), and <b>tallowwood</b> (E. microcorys). The forest habitat is noted as an endangered ecological community. Acacia pubescens (Downy Wattle) is a vulnerable flora species present as is the locally endangered Tadgell’s Bluebell (Wahlenbergia multicaulis). The endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog (Litoria aurea) has been recorded and frog ponds constructed {{as part of the}} creek. The frog has not been seen in the creek since 1995, though they are still present in the nearby constructed wetlands at the Juno Parade Brick Pit.|$|E
5000|$|E. grandis {{is found}} on coastal areas and sub-coastal ranges from the {{vicinity}} of Newcastle in New South Wales northwards to Bundaberg in central Queensland with disjunct populations further north near Mackay, Townsville and Daintree in northern Queensland, mainly on flat land and lower slopes. The soils are deep fertile alluvial loams. The annual rainfall varies from 1100 to 3500 mm. It is the dominant tree of wet forest and rain forest margins, either growing in pure stands or mixed with trees such as blackbutt (E. pilularis), <b>tallowwood</b> (E. microcorys), red mahogany (E. resinifera), Sydney blue gum (E. saligna), pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa). E. grandis {{has been established in}} plantations in northern Uruguay and is sold under the trade name [...] "Red Grandis".|$|E
50|$|The {{turpentine}} {{is found}} in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, from Atherton in the far north to {{as far south as}} Murramarang National Park. North of Gympie, the distribution is fragmented, with colonies on the Blackdown and Consuelo Tablelands, Tinaroo district and Windsor Tableland. The habitat most commonly associated with the turpentine is transitional forest between rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. Here it grows as an emergent tree, and is associated with such trees as flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), <b>tallowwood</b> (E. microcorys), grey ironbark (E. paniculata), white stringybark (E. globoidea), yellow stringybark (E. muelleriana), white-topped box (E. quadrangulata), rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and various rainforest species. It also grows with spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) and blackbutt (E. pilularis). On poorer soils, it can grow much smaller in dry sclerophyll forest in association with smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) and yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} using different material testing approaches to determine material properties of timber utility poles from two hardwood tree species, i. e. Spotted Gum and <b>Tallowwood.</b> The material properties investigated are the Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), the Modulus of Rupture (MOR) and the compression strength (CS) in longitudinal direction as well as radial and tangential directions of the {{cross section of the}} poles. These material properties are needed for the accurate modelling of timber poles using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the study of stress wave propagation and damage detection in timber utility poles. In open literatures, for most timber species such comprehensive material property data are scarce to find. Typically, material properties available are only in the longitudinal direction. Furthermore, most international standards cover only details on material testing in longitudinal direction and no coherent nor comprehensive guidelines are given for the testing of the full orthotropic material properties of timber. Hence, an extensive study is deemed necessary to investigate a suitable approach to determine full material properties of timber. Two hardwood timber species, namely Spotted Gum and <b>Tallowwood</b> are selected for this investigation. Beside full material properties, the investigation is extended to examine different material testing approaches (bending, compression and tension testing) for the determination of the same material properties. The presented material testing is conducted on numerous small clear specimens as well as on four full scale 5 m long timber pole specimens of the two mentioned hardwood tree species...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of marsupial folivores in Australian eucalypt forests is extremely patchy and, although distribution patterns {{are known to}} be partly determined by nutritional factors, the role of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) has been little studied. We investigated variation in the foliar concentrations of five constituents: total phenolics (TP); the foliar component bound by polyethylene glycol (PEGBC); the formylphloroglucinol compound, sideroxylonal (a strong deterrent of mammalian herbivory); the terpene, cineole; and nitrogen (N). These constituents were analyzed using near infrared spectroscopy in 501 individual <b>tallowwood</b> (Eucalyptus microcorys) trees at 42 sites across a broad geographic range in eastern Australia. We tested three hypotheses: (1) trees with lower foliar N produce higher PSM concentrations; (2) PSM concentrations are greater at colder sites; and (3) PSM concentrations are higher at sites with low resource availability. Hypothesis 1 was true for all PSMs considered and was the result of variation that occurred within sites. This is consistent with the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis and with the hypothesis that PSMs protect leaves from photodamage. Hypothesis 2 was upheld for all constituents. This was consistent with both the growth–differentiation balance hypothesis, and with the hypothesis that PSMs represent an evolutionary adaptation to greater risks of photodamage and frost damage in cold environments. Hypothesis 3 was rejected, with one PSM, sideroxylonal, being affected by resource availability in a manner opposite to that predicted. The optimal defense hypothesis offers an explanation for this result (as sideroxylonal concentrations increased along with the apparent nutritional quality of the foliage, possibly to provide defense against higher rates of herbivory). We found that trees associated with koala fecal pellets had lower concentrations of sideroxylonal and cineole. We discuss this finding and further implications for the herbivores of Eucalyptus of the patterns of plant defense that we detected...|$|E
