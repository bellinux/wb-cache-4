50|$|The {{seat of the}} Creighton-Ward dynasty is Creighton-Ward Mansion, an 18th-century stately home in Foxleyheath, Kent. The first mansion {{was built}} on the site of a Norman castle by the first Lord Creighton-Ward after he was knighted by Elizabeth I, who was a regular visitor. The current mansion was built by Lord Cuthbert Creighton-Ward in 1730 after he burned down the {{previous}} house during a gunpowder experiment. Lord Cuthbert asked architect Colen Campbell to design the iconic Palladian edifice, which has been designated a Grade I listed building by the World Heritage Organisation. When Penelope became a secret agent, she renovated the historic building to better suit her double lifestyle by installing a satellite antenna, a number of <b>two-way</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> consoles for contacting International Rescue, and a safe with state-of-the-art alarm system and CCTV. A forensic laboratory {{was built on the}} site of old servants' quarters. An underground river with a boat runs beneath the estate, and if Penelope thinks that Creighton-Ward Mansion is under surveillance or that she is in danger, she can meet Parker at a nearby village without anyone knowing.|$|E

This system can aid distance learning in several ways, both by presenting {{a better view of}} the instructor and teaching materials to the students, and by enabling better audience feedback to the instructor. Because the camera is fixed with respect to the background, simple motion analysis can be used to track objects and people of interest.

The collaboration is based on semimonthly videoconferences. Due to cultural and language barriers, we found it important to {{use a variety of}} communication techniques, ranging from audio and video to text-based chats. During the collaboration, we encountered a number of technical issues that caused communication breakdowns, and have taken various steps to improve the videoconference experience. In addition to improving the sound quality by using better microphone placements, we developed a number of systems that support different aspects of a videoconference. One of the new components is a system for panoramic <b>two-way</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> that digitally combines images from an array of inexpensive video cameras. We also provided a means for the remote display of presentations, made design changes to our conference room, and added support for taking meeting minutes and for reviewing captured videoconferences.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Video {{compression}} and communication {{has been an}} important field over the past decades and critical for many applications, e. g., video on demand, video-conferencing, and remote education. In many applications, providing low-delay and error-resilient video transmission and increasing the coding efficiency are two major challenges. Low-delay and error-resilient video coding is critical for real-time <b>two-way</b> <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> over wireless networks. Intra-refresh coding, which embeds intra coded regions into inter frames can achieve a relatively smooth bit-rate and terminate the error propagation caused by the transmission loss. In this dissertation, we propose a novel linear model for the intra-refresh cycle-size selection adapting to the network packet loss rates and the motions in the video content. We also propose a strategy that adapts the intra-refresh coding pattern to different cycle-size and obtains better R-D (Rate-Distortion) performance compared to traditional intra-refresh patterns. Experimental results show that the linear cycle-size selection model can achieve about 3 dB improvement compared with a fixed cycle-size. Also, with the proposed intra-refresh order, a 2. 0 % bitrate reduction is obtained in average compared with the vertical-partition intra-refresh. The Intra Block Copy (IntraBC) is a newly adopted tool in the H. 265 /HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) extension for the screen content video coding. The IntraBC tool efficiently encodes repeating patterns in a picture. The current IntraBC scheme achieves about 1. 0 % bit-rate reduction on average and up to 4. 3 % bit-rate reduction on natural content video for a database consisting of 2 K, 4 K, and 8 K sequences. In this dissertation, we propose to improve the IntraBC with a template matching block vector and a fractional search IntraBC. With these two tools, the gain on natural content video coding can be further improved by 0. 5 % on average and up to 2. 0 %. Intra prediction is an important tool in intra-frame video coding to reduce the spatial redundancy. In current coding standard H. 265 /HEVC, a copying-based method based on the boundary (or interpolated boundary) reference pixels is used to predict each pixel in the coding block to remove the spatial redundancy. We find that the conventional copying-based method can be further improved in two cases: 1) the boundary has an inhomogeneous region, and 2) the predicted pixel is far away from the boundary that the correlation between the predicted pixel and the reference pixels is relatively weak. This dissertation performs a theoretical analysis of the optimal weights based on a first-order Gaussian Markov model and the effects in these two cases. It also proposes a novel intra prediction scheme based on the analysis that smoothing the copying-based prediction can derive a better prediction block. Both the theoretical analysis of the coding gain and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed intra prediction method. An average gain of 2. 3 % on all intra coding can be achieved with the H. 265 /HEVC reference software. Noise affects the efficiency of motion compensated prediction and degrades the coding performance. Some techniques, e. g., bi-directional prediction, have been utilized to decrease the effects of the noise. In this dissertation, we propose to further reduce noise and improve compression performance by applying a bilateral filter in the motion compensated prediction. The bilateral filter can remove the noise while preserving the edges. Our experimental results show that adding the bilateral filter can achieve a 4. 9 %, 1. 6 %, 1. 6 % average gain, in H. 265 /HEVC Low-Delay P (LDP), Low-Delay B (LDB), and Random Access (RA) coding, respectively, over a set of HD and UHD sequences up to 8 K resolution...|$|E

It compares this environment with face-to-face (F 2 F) and provides descriptive information about instructional activities fostering instructor-student interaction and student-student interaction. The subjects studied were an experienced distance education instructor {{and his students}} at host and remote sites. The technical environment included two fully equipped video classrooms on the UMass Video Network, a five interactive system that provides <b>two-way</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> between students and instructor.

40|$|MobileASL is a video {{compression}} project for <b>two-way,</b> real-time <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> on cell phones, allowing Deaf people {{to communicate in}} the language most accessible to them, American Sign Language. Unfortunately, running MobileASL quickly depletes a full battery charge in a few hours. Previous work on MobileASL investigated a method called variable frame rate (VFR) to increase the battery duration. We expand on this previous work by creating two new power saving algorithms, variable spatial resolution (VSR), {{and the application of}} both VFR and VSR. These algorithms extend the battery life by altering the temporal and/or spatial resolutions of video transmitted on MobileASL. We found that implementing only VFR extended the battery life from 284 minutes to 307 minutes; implementing only VSR extended the battery life to 306 minutes, and implementing both VFR and VSR extended the battery life to 315 minutes. We evaluated all three algorithms by creating a linguistically accessible online survey to investigate Deaf people’s perceptions of video quality when these algorithms were applied. In our survey results, we found that VFR produces perceived video choppiness and VSR produces perceived video blurriness; however, a surprising finding was that when both VFR and VSR are used together, they largely ameliorate the choppiness and blurriness perceived, i. e., they each improve the use of the other. This is a useful finding because using VFR and VSR together saves the most battery life...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To get {{insight into}} the balance between costs and {{financial}} benefits of <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> in home care. METHOD: In a systematic review four databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL) were searched for studies on <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> for people living at home. Studies were exclusively included when data about costs of <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> as well as financial benefits were presented. Inclusion took place in two steps; hereafter included studies were assessed on their methodological quality and then relevant data were extracted. The data synthesis was descriptive. All steps were performed by two researchers. RESULTS: Twenty articles (nine studies) were included. The studies were mainly conducted in the USA. The client populations varied between studies. The outcome variables and the methods, used for cost calculations and financial benefits, differed very much. The methodological quality was poor except for one study. Seven of these nine studies did not demonstrate significantly greater financial benefits than the costs of <b>video</b> <b>communication.</b> In five studies there was an intervention group and a control group. Two of these studies showed that the ratio of costs - financial benefits in the group who used <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> was greater than in the control group. In one of both studies, the ratio costs – financial benefits was statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Because of the weak conduction of the economic studies, no statements are possible {{about the relationship between}} costs and financial benefits of <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> in the home care. More and methodologically well conducted research is needed. CONCLUSION: There is (still) no evidence showing that implementation of <b>video</b> <b>communication</b> into the home care is a cost-effective intervention. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
