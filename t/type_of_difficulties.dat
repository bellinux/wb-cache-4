However, there is no anti-discrimination legislation, or other sanctions for those who violate the rights of LGBTI people. Further, marriage is limited strictly to opposite-sex couples. This definition is also used in the Law on Marriage and Family, where article 3 reads: ‘marriage is a solemn contract {{between a man and}} a woman’, and in article 6 ”marriages are prohibited between persons of the same sex”. The Constitution extends its rights and freedoms to every citizen, regardless of ‘race, colour, sex… or other status’ - a phrasing that can be used in favour of LGBTI persons’ rights, given its intent to provide equality regardless of personal characteristics.With widespread corruption and a long road ahead for Cambodia to become a constitutional state, LGBTI persons face the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> as other citizens, where rule of law is weak. In addition, they are also targets of extortion related to their LGBTI identitiesThe most common situation where LGBTI persons face poor attitudes from authorities is when police target lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals for financial gain. There are two provisions: ‘Human trafficking law’ and ‘Commune and village safety policy’. The police have used these to arrest people (mostly transgender and gay men) under false charges and claim a payment (between USD 10 and 30) not to keep them overnight. Transgender sex workers are frequently abused by the police. UNDP reports that local authorities and police sometimes use various laws to limit the rights of LGBTI people; for example through forced separation of same-sex couples, as per parental request, or linking of LGBTI people with drug use or sex workIssues related to LGBTI persons’ living conditions and rights are overall absent from political and media discourse in Cambodia. There are a few cases where LGBTI matters have made it to the public agenda, with officials both speaking in favour and against LGBTI rights. There is no legal group yet to protect LGBT who are victims of legal abuses as well as human right violations. October 2014 a lesbian couple got married but police and commune officials stop them from getting married while their both family still continued and committed to make the marriage happened in cultural way.

40|$|The {{associations}} between self-reported rewards and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> caregiving and burden {{were examined in}} a sample of 200 informal caregivers to older post-rehabilitation patients. Sixteen percent (16 %) of caregivers reported that caregiving was physically difficult only, 15 % reported emotional difficulties only, 11 % reported social difficulties only, 17 % reported multiple difficulties, and 40 % had no <b>difficulties.</b> Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (e. g., social, emotional, and physical) was significantly associated with burden in univariate and multiple linear regression analyses, control-ling for confounding characteristics. Caregivers reporting multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> experienced higher levels of burden than caregivers who reported only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Caregivers who received more rewards from caregiv-ing reported fewer difficulties. Caregiving rewards had no independent effect on burden but modified the {{associations between}} social and emotional difficulties and burden. In summary, caregiving rewards and difficulties were not mu-tually exclusive, and their relationship in turn affected burden. MOST studies of informal caregivers to elderly adultshave focused on the adverse effects of caregiving. These studies have found that informal caregivers experi-ence high rates of burden (Zarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980), less satisfaction with social supports (Cantor, 1983; George & Gwyther, 1986), and more depression, poorer physical health, and higher rates of psychotropic medica-tion use than non-caregivers (George & Gwyther, 1986...|$|R

That is, once again, to reach a consensus on core ethical issues and how to transmit them. Hence, ten thematic areas were selected which were considered as core to a bioethics program in the 9 th grade.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigate}} quantum algorithms for graph colouring problems, in particular for 2 - and 3 -colouring of graphs. Our main {{goal is to}} establish a set of quantum representations and operations suitable for the problem at hand. We propose unitary- as well as measurement-based quantum computations, also taking inspiration from answer set programming, a form of declarative programming close to traditional logic programming. The approach used is one in which we first generate arbitrary solutions to the problem, then constraining these according to the problem’s input. Though we do not achieve fundamental speed-ups, our algorithms show how quantum concepts can be used for programming and moreover exhibit structural differences. For example, we compute all possible colourings at the same time. We compare our algorithms with classical ones, highlighting how the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> give rise to NP-complete behaviour, and propose possible improvements...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the problem}} of {{tracking}} desired longitudinal and lateral motions for a vehicle is addressed. Let us point out that a "good" modeling is often quite difficult or even impossible to obtain. It is due for example to parametric uncertainties, for the vehicle mass, inertia or for the interaction forces between the wheels and the road pavement. To overcome this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulties,</b> we consider a model-free control approach leading to "intelligent" controllers. The longitudinal and the lateral motions, on one hand, and the driving/braking torques and the steering wheel angle, on the other hand, are respectively the output and the input variables. An {{important part of this}} work is dedicated to present simulation results with actual data. Actual data, used in Matlab as reference trajectories, have been previously recorded with an instrumented Peugeot 406 experimental car. The simulation results show the efficiency of our approach.
