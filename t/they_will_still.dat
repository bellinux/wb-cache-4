The wind wanes and the men witness arrows flying from the {{fingertips}} of Þorgerðr, each arrow killing {{a man of the}} Jomsviking fleet. The Jomsvikings tell Sigvaldi that although they are no longer fighting men alone, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> do their best.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to participate in the}} Eurovision Song Contest. For broadcasters to participate, they must be member of the EBU and register their intention to compete before the deadline specified in the rules of that year's event. Each participating broadcaster pays a fee towards the organisation of the contest. Should a country withdraw from the contest after the deadline, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> need to pay these fees, and may also incur a fine or temporary ban.|$|E
5|$|When Andy {{returns from}} camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, {{thinking}} {{that his mother}} bought them. He then repairs Woody's torn arm while Wheezy's squeaker has also been fixed. Meanwhile, Al's business has suffered due to him failing to sell the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz {{that he no longer}} worried about Andy outgrowing him because, when he eventually does, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> have each other for company.|$|E

5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union: Cyprus is not depicted on current notes, as the map does not extend far enough east; and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. The European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years, and a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical to the current series: bridges and arches. However, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E

60|$|In your {{operations}} {{down the}} Mississippi {{you must not}} rely too confidently upon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as {{it is possible that}} {{they may not be able}} to pass or reduce Port Hudson. <b>They,</b> however, <b>will</b> do everything in their power to form a junction with you at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to effect this, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> at least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces, and prevent them from reinforcing Vicksburg.

25|$|During their careers, masked luchadores {{will often}} {{be seen in}} public wearing their masks and keeping up the culture of Lucha Libre, while other masked wrestlers will {{interact}} with the public and press normally. However, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> {{go to great lengths}} to conceal their true identities; in effect, the mask is synonymous with the luchador. El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask.|$|E
25|$|The SWANCC {{decision}} affects {{not only}} privately owned lands but also isolated waters and wetlands on public lands: {{the federal government}} owns about one- third of the nation's lands.

25|$|Such {{a special}} role of sucrose in the {{formation}} of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet, such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.|$|E

25|$|Even if {{a member}} {{of any of these}} subgroups moves to a {{different}} region, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be known by the name of their ancestral region. For example, if a Gurian moves to Tbilisi (part of the Kartli region) he will not automatically identify himself as Kartlian despite actually living in Kartli. This may, however, change if substantial amount of time passes. For example, there are some Mingrelians who have lived in the Imereti region for centuries and are now identified as Imeretian or Imeretian-Mingrelians.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September 2007, Gaston Hebert, {{the then}} apostolic {{administrator}} of the Diocese of Little Rock, stated that (per the 11 July Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) six Arkansas nuns were excommunicated for heresy (the first in the diocese's 165-year history). They refused to recant the doctrines of the Community of the Lady of All Nations (Army of Mary). The nuns {{are members of the}} Good Shepherd Monastery of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge in Hot Springs. Sister Mary Theresa Dionne, 82, one of the six, said <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> live at the convent property, which they own.

25|$|In August 2006, {{however, the}} Spears won {{a court case}} for {{inclusion}} into the 2007 season, which {{would be at the}} expense of the Cats, who changed their name to the Lions the following month. SA Rugby and the South African Rugby Union were expected to appeal the High Court of South Africa's decision. In November 2006, SA Rugby and the Spears reached a settlement. The financially troubled Spears abandoned the court case. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> exist as an organisation to promote and develop rugby in the Southern and Eastern Cape region, with the support of SA Rugby and the SARU, but will now not be a part of Super Rugby in the foreseeable future. With the settlement, the season's Super 14 line-up was set, with the Lions taking up the final South African place.|$|E

On 11 November, 26 Whanganui Māori were arrested and Bryce, frustrated {{in his attempt to}} identify those from outside central Taranaki, telegraphed Hall to advise he intended destroying every whare in the village. He told Hall: [...] "Consider, here are 2000 people sitting still, absolutely declining to give me any indication of where they belong to; <b>they</b> <b>will</b> sit <b>still</b> where <b>they</b> are and do nothing else." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it is {{sometimes}} {{the case that the}} birds of which I write are so tame that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> sit <b>still</b> on a tree till they are all shot, one by one, if only the hunter is careful to fire at the lowest bird first, and so proceed upwards. If he should kill the top bird first, its fluttering fall disturbs the rest, causing them to take wing. Fully aware of this fact, Big Otter and I fired alternate shots, and in a few seconds brought down the whole covey. This quite filled one of our bags.|$|R
40|$|Although {{security}} models abound, {{they are}} usually {{an integral part of}} the system or a totally separate external component.

25|$|Following {{last year}} {{promotions}} of youth players Sandy Paillot, Anthony Mounier and Romain Beynié from the youth scheme {{to the professional}} squad, Lyon signed another set of youth players to professional contracts. Midfielders Pierrick Valdivia (no relation to Chilean playmaker Jorge Valdivia), Clément Grenier and Saïd Mehamha, and striker Yannis Tafer were promoted to the first-team squad, although <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> play on Lyon's second squad in the CFA. Lyon also sign young prospect Timothée Kolodziejczak from Lens. Kolodziejcak, a teammate of Tafer and Grenier on the international stage, will initially move to Lyon on a loan with a purchase clause likely to occur at a later date. Also {{in an effort to}} increase their youths' playing time, Lyon re-loaned Sandy Paillot to Grenoble for the entirety of the season and loaned out midfielder Romain Beynié to Belgian side Tubize.|$|E

In the end he makes the apology, not publicly, but privately to his nearest advisors. He assures them that, even though Gianelli's help is much needed, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> run a campaign that does not shrink from handling controversial issues.

50|$|Voices of the angelic choir herald León, {{the last}} post {{remaining}} before Santiago, {{a stark contrast}} to the pleading prayers evoked in Burgos. Ostinatos, like previous movements, are the backdrop Talbot uses to set his melodies, like a psalm-tone in Gregorian chant. The harmonies are more consonant, and even the texts reflect a hopeful and aspiring love: Beate, qui habitant in domo tua, Domine; In saecula saeculorum laudabant te (Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be <b>still</b> praising thee 84:4). Diatonic and step-wise in motion, the simplicity of melody is a chant, a song of wonder, for the graces of God’s gifts.|$|R
