5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
40|$|A {{cylindrical}} bump with a spherical {{free end}} has been {{mounted on a}} cylindrical surface, and flow visualization, surface pressure measurements and the turbulent velocity statistics measurements were performed. The thickness of the turbulent boundary layer was thinner than <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> height at <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>bump.</b> Slenderness parameter (H/D) of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> was 1. This setup was a prototype of a typical wall-mounted sensor on aircrafts, therefore it has practical importance. Analysis of the experimental data shows that thickness of the turbulent boundary layer controls the location of separation over <b>the</b> <b>bump.</b> Spherical ending of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> delays <b>the</b> separation, especially from half height of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> to <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>bump.</b> It also affects the strength of trailing vortices created at the free end of <b>the</b> <b>bump,</b> and hence size of the separated region.

25|$|Moths' {{eyes have}} an unusual property: their {{surfaces}} {{are covered with}} a natural nanostructured film, which eliminates reflections. This allows the moth to see well in the dark, without reflections to give its location away to predators. The structure consists of a hexagonal pattern of bumps, each roughly 200nm high and spaced on 300nm centers. This kind of antireflective coating works because <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so the light sees the surface as having a continuous refractive index gradient between {{the air and the}} medium, which decreases reflection by effectively removing the air-lens interface. Practical anti-reflective films have been made by humans using this effect; this is a form of biomimicry.|$|E

After his morning accident, Boullion drove steadily to take a provisional 21stposition, complaining of a dire lack of grip from the C14 chassis. Another Monaco rookie, Eddie Irvine, out-paced his more experienced Jordan teammate, Rubens Barrichello, as the pair set the ninth and 13th-fastest times respectively. They were split by Coulthard and the Ligier drivers, with Martin Brundle ahead of Olivier Panis, despite the former crashing at La Rascasse and removing his rear wing as the rain fell. Gianni Morbidelli, who took 14thplace, was another driver to crash during the sudden change to wet conditions, as did Footwork teammate Taki Inoue on his way to 24thposition. Minardi drivers Luca Badoer and Pierluigi Martini occupied the provisional eighthrow of the grid, just ahead of Tyrrell teammates Mika Salo and Ukyo Katayama, both of whom complained of poor handling over <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> and understeer, despite the expected benefits of the Hydrolink suspension.|$|E
500|$|Rowing at Oriel {{is carried}} out from the college's own boat-house across Christ Church Meadow. Oriel has a {{reputation}} for its success in rowing, in particular the two intercollegiate bumps races, Torpids and Eights Week. Oriel holds more Torpids Headships than any other college and, as of 2016, was tied for the most Summer Eights headships. In 2006 Oriel claimed the first ever double headship in Torpids, rowing over as Head of the River in both the men's and women's first divisions, it remains the only college to have done so. Both Men's and Women's 1st VIIIs ceded the headship of Torpids in 2008 by being bumped; the positions remained unchanged in 2007 as Torpids were cancelled. In recent years, Oriel claimed the women's Torpids Headship in 2017 and has held the men's Headship in Eights in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The women's and men's second boats are currently in [...] "fixed divisions" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> charts and, as such, are guaranteed a place in racing each year. The college usually fields third boats (and sometimes more) for <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> events. In addition to the Oxford-based races, Oriel crews compete in external events including the Head of the River Race, the Women's Eights Head of the River Race, the Henley Boat Races and regional events. In 2016 the men's first boat won the Fairbairn Cup. In Tom Brown at Oxford by Thomas Hughes, Oriel's win in the 1842 Head of the River Race, with Oriel bumping Trinity, was re-written as Tom's college, [...] "St Ambrose" [...] taking first place and [...] "Oriel" [...] in second place.|$|E
40|$|IUE {{data are}} used to {{investigate}} {{the properties of the}} 2175 A interstellar extinction bump toward 45 reddened Milky Way stars. Using analytic fitting functions, parameters are derived which describe the central position, FWHM, and strength of <b>the</b> <b>bump.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bump</b> position is very stable, with an extreme deviation which is still significantly larger than the measurement uncertainty, indicating true variability. <b>The</b> <b>bump</b> FWHM has a large range of intrinsic values, 0. 77 /micron to 1. 25 /micron. <b>The</b> normalized <b>bump</b> strength varies by more than a factor of three. There are no convincing correlations among <b>the</b> three <b>bump</b> parameters, but <b>the</b> width of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> is strongly correlated with the dust grain environments.

Experimental data showed that in a Mach 1. 3 freestream over <b>the</b> baseline plain <b>bump,</b> significant flow separation appeared at <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> crest {{that led to the}} formation of a large wake region downstream.

In contrast, it was found that the size of the wake region and the spanwise vortices could be reduced by blowing sonic jet in <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> valley. This approach of flow control found to be the most effective when the total pressure of the blowing jet was 2 bar.

Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes.
