By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them.

After a losing record in 1981–82, Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster. Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On 1 December 1943, the {{division}} {{was once again}} renamed. Now known as the 77th (Holding) Division, it was responsible for retraining soldiers {{who had been on}} medical leave. Once recruits were fully trained, and men returning from injury retrained, they were allocated to formations fighting overseas. Notably, the formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group, which was fighting in Normandy. After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France, {{the division}} was disbanded and re-formed as a deception unit to give Germany the impression that the British army had more divisions <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> The notional 77th Division was held in reserve within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequence data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> with the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in reality.|$|E
5|$|Clint Benedict was {{the first}} goaltender to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. He quickly {{abandoned}} his mask as its design interfered with his vision. Twenty-nine years later, on November 1, 1959, {{in a game against}} New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey. The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat {{on the board of the}} NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it could not contribute more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> but the players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, nearly every NHL player had signed up. Led by Alan Eagleson, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) was formed in 1967 and it quickly received acceptance from the owners.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, Croatian forces {{managed to}} interdict radio {{communications}} between the 32nd Mechanised Brigade artillery and its artillery observers, {{and set up}} their own transmitter to direct JNA artillery fire against the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks. This deception was designed to deceive Davidović into thinking that the ZNG had much greater firepower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> The plan worked and when ZNG troops entered the barracks compound that day, the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment (four officers and 196 soldiers) surrendered. Late in the evening of 19 September, Croatian police and elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 104th Brigade secured the Varaždinbreg weapons storage facility located in the village of Banjšćina near Varaždin, after its JNA commander surrendered the facility and its garrison of 60 without resistance. The capture of JNA weapons greatly improved the Croatian position in negotiations when trying to convince JNA commanding officers of the 32nd Corps to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Sales of the Master System {{have been}} {{estimated}} at 13 million units, not including recent Brazil sales, {{in contrast to}} the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor, the Famicom. Sega would close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 million consoles compared with the 49 million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles sold by Nintendo. The Master System saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in Japan and North America. In 1989, the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group's Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service. However, the Electronic Gaming Monthly 1992 Buyer's Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the Master System. In 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases. According to Bill Pearse of Playthings, the NES gained an advantage over the Master System through the use of better software and stronger character identification.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E

By genre, it is the ninth-highest grossing musical and the tenth-highest earner among comedy road movies. It ranks second, between Wayne's World and Wayne's World 2 (which, coincidentally, also take place in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, in the outlying suburb of Aurora, Illinois), among films adapted from Saturday Night Live sketches.
