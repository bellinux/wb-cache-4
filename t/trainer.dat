5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat <b>trainer</b> was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The <b>trainer</b> was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the <b>trainer</b> was cancelled with the success of the <b>trainer</b> version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} how <b>trainers</b> perceived the vocational training programme in family medicine in Hong Kong. Design: Structured discussion with <b>trainers</b> who had trainees in the community-based {{segment of the}} vocational training programme of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians. Subjects: Forty seven eligible <b>trainers</b> were identified and invited to attend the discussion. Thirteen <b>trainers</b> participated in two structured discussions. Main outcome measures: The opinions expressed by the participants towards the vocational training programme. Results: The response rate was 27. 7 %. The <b>trainers</b> were clear about their roles but saw an overlap between their functions {{and those of the}} trainees' supervisors. They were unsure on what to teach and how to teach, and looked for guidance from the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians. They felt that there should be more varied training methods, more resources at training centres, better training arrangements and more coordination among training stakeholders. Some <b>trainers</b> experienced difficulties with their trainees. All <b>trainers</b> saw the benefit of an annual <b>trainers</b> workshop. Conclusion: It is recommended that the College provides better organisation for and training of <b>trainers.</b> A <b>trainers</b> co-ordinator, a <b>trainers</b> handbook and an annual <b>trainers</b> workshop are some suggestions. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The second consideration is the strong identification of the education conception adopted by teacher's <b>trainers</b> with its manifestation in their pedagogical practice.
