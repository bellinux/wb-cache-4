5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of oil shale in Estonia, both of which are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E

They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E

5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. The first is the more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one is after the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both a portrait of the Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing baby clothes and riding in a little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E

25|$|The surface plasmon {{polariton}} (SPP) is an electromagnetic {{surface wave}} that travels along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under {{the condition that}} the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the plasma frequency. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.|$|E
25|$|The Sommerfeld–Zenneck wave or Zenneck wave is a non-radiative guided {{electromagnetic}} wave that {{is supported by}} a planar or spherical interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constants. This surface wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property known as evanescence. It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> positive, as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the plasma frequency. Arising from original analysis by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck of the problem of wave propagation over a lossy earth, it exists as an exact solution to Maxwell's equations.|$|E
