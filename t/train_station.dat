In Tennessee, Hines diverted the Union troops' attention away from John Hunt Morgan, and was himself recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging. He escaped that night by telling stories to the soldier in charge of him and subdued him when given the chance. A few days later he again escaped Union soldiers who intended to hang him.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of railway travel on urban spatial {{structure}} in a polycentric urban land use model. We focus on the role of access to the railway network. We find that if the number of <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> is limited, the degree of urbanization is higher around <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> but {{the effect of}} railway travel on road congestion is small. By contrast, if <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> are omnipresent there is little effect on urban spatial structure, but a considerable decrease in congestion. With regard to the supply of <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> these findings suggest that there is an important policy trade-off between congestion and urbanization...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the <b>train</b> <b>station.</b> This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland <b>train</b> <b>station</b> a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine <b>train</b> <b>station,</b> both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who designed the new <b>train</b> <b>station.</b> Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E
