25|$|Flight 2311 was {{scheduled}} initially {{to be operated}} by N228AS, another EMB-120. However, this airplane experienced mechanical problems, and so the flight was switched to N270AS.

Flight 2311 departed Atlanta, operating N270AS, at 13:47, 23 minutes behind schedule.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} two {{offensive}} drives, quarterback Ricky Stanzi, who had surgery to repair a muscle tear that {{was a result of}} his injury against Northwestern, led the Hawkeyes into the end zone, throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Marvin McNutt and a 21-yard pass to Colin Sandeman to give Iowa the early 14–0 advantage. But as he had done three <b>times</b> <b>already</b> in 2009, Stanzi also threw an interception that resulted in six points for the other team, with Jerrard Tarrant scoring from 40 yards on the return.|$|E

25|$|Professor John Tyndall and Whymper {{emulated}} {{each other}} in determined attempts to reach {{the summit of the}} Matterhorn by the south-western, or Italian, ridge. In 1865, Whymper, who had failed eight <b>times</b> <b>already,</b> attempted unsuccessfully to climb a couloir on the south-east face with Michel Croz. After Croz left for a prior engagement with Charles Hudson, Whymper was unable to secure the services of Val Tournanche guide Jean Antoine Carrel, and instead planned to try the eastern face with Lord Francis Douglas and the two Zermatt guides, Peter Taugwalder father and son.|$|E
500|$|Richard Johnson was {{credited}} later with killing Tecumseh personally, {{which he used}} to become a [...] "career politician" [...] and master of the Great Crossings area. Indian reports were that Tecumseh {{was killed by a}} man on horseback, and Johnson {{was one of the few}} mounted men at that side of the battle. (His own men had dismounted, and Shelby's were infantry.) Furthermore, Johnson, who had been wounded four <b>times</b> <b>already,</b> had been shot in the shoulder by an Indian chief who was advancing to tomahawk Johnson, when he shot back and killed the Indian instantly with a single pistol shot. A nineteenth-century source asserts that Tecumseh's body was found, near Johnson's hat and scabbard, shot from above (as from horseback), and wounded with Johnson's usual load of two buckshot and a pistol ball.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has put me in three <b>times</b> <b>already</b> and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{physical}} afflictions {{were regarded}} as furthermore supporting weakness of a nithing. It was often hard to distinguish these attributes from actual physical illness, and since [...] "any eeriness and incomprehensibility was what made people suspect a person of being a nithing, whether this was based upon physical anomalies or mental traits", they were often regarded as mentally ill even during ancient <b>times</b> <b>already,</b> as defined by actually or perceivedly deviant social behaviour and feeling.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:45 am, the Onondaga {{opened up}} on the {{grounded}} ironclads {{at a distance of}} around a half of a mile but the rebels could not return the fire because of the positions in which their ships were stuck, Mitchell wrote; [...] "During the whole time while aground, neither the Richmond nor the Virginia [...] could get a gun to bear upon the enemy." [...] By 11:00 am the tide had been lifting for hours and just when it seemed that the Confederates were helpless to resist, their ironclads began to float again and their guns were brought to bear. Onondaga fired around seven rounds at Virginia II and when she was refloated a single shot was returned that, according to Mitchell, was [...] "observed to take effect" [...] upon the monitor. The naval duel did not last long compared to the other actions and it ended as the Confederates withdrew up river a short distance. The Union ships did the same and they pulled off heading down stream but the batteries kept firing all day and night. At 9:00 pm Commodore Mitchell ordered his men to make the final cruise to City Point but {{it was found that the}} Virginia II was unmanageable. She had been struck by cannon fire seventy <b>times</b> <b>already</b> and it caused steam to leak from the ironclad's deck which impaired the pilots visibility. The Drewry and the Scorpion were lost and one other torpedo boat was disabled by the federals.|$|E
