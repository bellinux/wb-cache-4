40|$|<b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{polishing}} pad are of great significance for <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> optical workpieces in the continuous polishing process. Three main factors which affect <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad, including the {{polishing pad}} creep deformation, the calibration plate grinding and the ambient change in temperature, are analyzed in this work. Processing parameters including the eccentricity between the polishing pad and the calibration plate, the calibration plate thickness, angular velocities of the pad are introduced in this analytic process. With this method, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polishing pad in the continuous polishing can be obtained. This work provides theoretical guidance for the deterministic processing of the continuous polishing process...|$|R

The fishing industry accounts for 0.4% (fewer than 50 people) although the processing sector is considered separately under manufacturing and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> 50 people relates directly to the catching and support sectors.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1260, {{the church}} {{belongs to the}} {{transition}} period from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. The first {{is characterized by the}} plant ornament of the capital of the pilasters and the second by thee star (asteroid) vaults. The portal was also originally Romanesque – the vimperg on the round arch had a niche with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> the patron saint. The inner walls were covered with paintings, the floor consisting of the gravestones of clergymen and distinguished noblemen. A unique round baptismal chapel was built {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus {{as described in the}} Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E

Another man stands, echoing and opposing {{the form of}} the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> {{the ideal}} woman, {{are central to}} La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity {{is limited to the}} insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, {{the moon}} was personified as the male god *Meh1not.

Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the Moon are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the Greek tradition are preserved in <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> Menelaus.|$|E
