40|$|In the 2014 {{finalised}} {{timetable for}} Sweden 314 operation days had a {{unique set of}} trains i. e. a unique traffic pattern. Despite this, the finalised timetable generally provides only one conflict resolved <b>train</b> <b>path</b> for each <b>train,</b> and this <b>train</b> <b>path</b> is to be used for all of the train’s operation days. Further, once the yearly timetable has been finalised <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> may not be changed, causing great inflexibility in later planning stages. Rather than finalizing entire <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> only certain characteristics of a <b>train</b> <b>path,</b> called delivery commitments, could be finalised. This allows for more flexibility in later planning stages. Delivery commitments could e. g. be arrival and departure times at important locations or the total running time, depending on the needs of the operator. In this paper we present a method for generating delivery commitments based on analyzing a yearlong timetable, called the control timetable. The control timetable is constructed using rolling horizon planning and a MIP-model that optimises the <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> for each day individually. Further, different <b>train</b> <b>path</b> characteristics are optimized for different operators. The proposed method was tested in a case study from Sweden. The results show that by constructing one <b>train</b> <b>path</b> for each individual day rather than one for the entire year the resulting delivery commitments allow for a more efficient use of infrastructure. The results also show that the proposed method allows for different <b>train</b> <b>path</b> characteristics to be optimised for different operators. ...|$|R

40|$|The train {{timetable}} {{dominates the}} rail traffic organization. The timetabling quality {{should be evaluated}} to check the work skill of train timetable managers. The values of existing timetable evaluation indexes vary with infrastructure features and traffic flow; therefore, they are not comparable in fact. Furthermore, subjective inputs like expert scores are involved in evaluation; this will lead to unreliable results because the experts may have different opinions. To overcome these shortages, we propose a relative <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency index by taking the <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> as production units. Each unit consumes some transport resources and produces some feedback outputs. A DEA model is applied to compute the <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency.
