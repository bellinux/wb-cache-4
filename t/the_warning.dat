5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> signal.

5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough to enhance <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn {{to avoid the}} cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

5|$|Blue Alert warnings, which {{indicate}} that a cyclone may affect <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> area within 48hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were upgraded to a Yellow Alert– an indication that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> area in 12hours– at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert– meaning the cyclone is imminent– at 8 pm. In general, residents were well informed of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated to homes in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department of Family and Children's Services. 280people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> was discontinued after the system moved inland. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>warning,</b> Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{statement}} {{on the same day}} as the bombing, RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan accused the RIRA of deliberately trying to direct civilians to the bombing site.

The RIRA strongly denied that it intended to target civilians. It also stated that <b>the</b> <b>warnings</b> were not intended to lead people to the bombing site.

5|$|Immediately upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando.

Late on August 15, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was discontinued.

Participants completed pre-exposure and post-exposure questionnaires that assessed their awareness of the health risks of smoking, response to <b>the</b> package <b>warnings,</b> and interest in quitting smoking. Exposure to <b>the</b> pictorial <b>warnings</b> resulted in increased awareness of the risks of smoking, stronger behavioral response to <b>the</b> <b>warnings</b> and increased interest in quitting smoking. <b>The</b> new <b>warnings</b> in Malaysia will increase smokers’ knowledge of the adverse health effects of smoking and {{have a positive effect on}} interest in quitting...|$|R
