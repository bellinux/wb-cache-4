40|$|PURPOSE: (18) F-Labelled {{fluorodeoxyglucose}} (FDG) {{can detect}} early changes in tumour metabolism {{and may be}} a useful quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB) for prediction of disease stabilization, response and duration of progression-free survival (PFS). Standardization of imaging procedures is a prerequisite, especially in multicentre clinical trials. In this study we reviewed the quality of FDG scans and compliance with the imaging guideline (IG) in a phase III clinical trial. METHODS: Forty-four cancer patients were enroled in an imaging sub-study of a randomized international multicentre trial. FDG scan had to be performed at baseline and 10 - 14 days after treatment start. The image <b>transmittal</b> <b>forms</b> (ITFs) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) [1] standard headers were analysed for compliance with the IG. Mean liver standardized uptake values (LSUVmean) were measured as recommended by positron emission tomography (PET) Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 1. 0 (PERCIST) [2]. RESULTS: Of 88 scans, 81 were received (44 patients); 36 were properly anonymized; 77 / 81 serum glucose values submitted, all but one within the IG. In 35 / 44 patients both scans were of sufficient visual quality. In 22 / 70 ITFs the reported UT differed by > 1 min from the DICOM headers (max. difference 1 h 4 min). Based on the DICOM, UT compliance for both scans was 31. 4 %. LSUVmean was fairly constant for the 11 patients with UT compliance: 2. 30 +/- 0. 33 at baseline and 2. 27 +/- 0. 48 at follow-up (FU). Variability substantially increased for the subjects with unacceptable UT (11 patients) : 2. 27 +/- 1. 04 at baseline and 2. 18 +/- 0. 83 at FU. CONCLUSION: The high attrition number of patients due to low compliance with the IG compromised the quantitative assessment of the predictive value for early response monitoring. This emphasizes the need for better regulated procedures in imaging departments, which may be achieved by education of involved personnel or efforts towards regulations. LSUVmean could be monitored to assess quality and compliance in an FDG PET/CT study...|$|R
40|$|La {{medicina}} tradicional china tiene una historia milenaria. Actualmente despierta un creciente interés que ha determinado un incremento en las demandas de capacitación por los prestadores de servicios de salud. En China la medicina tradicional china contabiliza el 40 % de la atención sanitaria, y con el respaldo que significa el apoyo gubernamental se ha perfeccionado su nivel académico. Se realizó el siguiente análisis con el objetivo de determinar los antecedentes históricos y el estado actual de la docencia de la medicina tradicional china en el sistema de educación superior del llamado &# 8220;gigante asiático&# 8221;. Se determinó que históricamente la enseñanza de la medicina tradicional china tiene como formas fundamentales de transmisión las así llamadas &# 8220;secreta&# 8221;, &# 8220;personal&# 8221; y &# 8220;estandarizada&# 8221;. Esta última tiene antecedentes en instituciones que datan de tiempos de la dinastía Tang. Luego de un período de decadencia a finales de la dinastía Qing y durante la República del Kuomintang, la medicina tradicional china se ha desarrollado en el escenario de la educación superior en su país de origen con un apoyo gubernamental significativo. Este desarrollo ha permitido universalizar su enseñanza por todo la nación, alcanzando algunas universidades el nivel de centros colaboradores de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Los programas docentes han evolucionado en el tiempo y actualmente permiten la especialización en diferentes áreas de la medicina tradicional china desde el nivel de licenciatura hasta el posdoctoral. The chinese {{traditional medicine}} has a millenary history. Currently it arouses a growing interest that has determined {{an increase in}} the capacitating demands of the health care givers. In China, the Chinese traditional medicine accounts for the 40 % of the health care, and with the government support it has improved its academic level. We carried out the following analysis with the objective of determining the historical antecedents of the traditional Chinese medicine and the current status of its teaching in the high education system of the so called &# 8220;Asiatic giant&# 8221;. We determined that historically the chinese traditional medicine teaching has, as main <b>transmittal</b> <b>form</b> the so called &# 8220;secret&# 8221;, &# 8220;personal&# 8221; and &# 8220;standardized&# 8221; forms. The last one has its antecedents in institutions dating from the times of the Tang dynasty. After a period of decadency {{at the end of the}} Qing dynasty and during the Kuomintang Republic, the Chinese traditional medicine has achieved a great development in the scenery of the Chinese high education with a significant government support. This development has allowed the universalization of its teaching around the nation, and some universities has reached the level of collaborating centers of the World Health Organization. The teaching programs have evolved in the time, and currently they allow the specialization in different areas of the Chinese traditional medicine, form the level of graduated to the postdoctoral level...|$|E
