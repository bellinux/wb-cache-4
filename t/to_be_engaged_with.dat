Guadagnino and Filomarino developed an [...] "exquisite and extraordinary" [...] relationship with Mukdeeprom during the production of Antonia, the cinematographer's first non-Thai film. Lighting {{is an important factor in}} Mukdeeprom's work, as he needs the light <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> the characters. In order to capture the Northern Italian summer atmosphere for Call Me by Your Name, he had to create completely artificial light, due to the heavy rains that lasted the entirety of the shoot. He also connected to the actors during the scene; when they finished shooting the first take of the confrontation between Oliver and Elio, he was crying in a corner of the room. The film was shot using a 35 mm lens, a decision influenced by the work of David Cronenberg in order to [...] "solidif the point of view." ...|$|E
2500|$|The respite proved only brief as the Viet Cong soon {{located the}} Australian position.

Movement was soon detected through the trees; however, {{at a distance of}} [...] the Australians thought they may have been B Company, and only engaged the Viet Cong as they moved out of range to the north. By following up the withdrawal of 12 Platoon and conducting a number of probes, the attackers succeeded in confirming D Company's position. A company-sized Viet Cong force subsequently formed up to their south on a broad frontage which threatened to engulf them. The assault commenced at 18:35, with several bugle blasts marking the beginning of a series of human wave attacks against D Company. Well spaced, the assault force stepped-off at a fast walk supported by a company in reserve which moved [...] to their rear. Yet as they did so an accurate barrage from the Australian artillery fell among them, effectively destroying the rear echelon. The assault force continued on regardless, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> small arms just [...] from the forward Australian positions. Lacking any reserve the assault was rapidly halted, although many of the attackers that remained unwounded then attempted to crawl around the D Company perimeter, from where they engaged the defenders individually, while snipers fired from the trees.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, a study {{conducted}} on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, {{they found that the}} countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which they were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with,</b> and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of aln [...] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.|$|E

The disparity in Indigenous student and staff numbers in mainstream and flexi schools offers new ideas to the broader Indigenous education agenda that may have implications for all education settings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Play for Health (P 4 H) is an {{open and}} {{extensible}} telerehabilitation platform. It allows patients to perform rehabilitation exercises {{through a variety of}} videogames and interaction methods. Here, we extend P 4 H to address the training needs of patients with Parkinson's disease. We integrate a network of on-body inertial measurement units. This allows new motion-based interactions in serious games at home, and it is a cornerstone extension allowing P 4 H to now also assess the patient’s movements in daily life. We introduce three new serious games in a virtual world on this platform. The game objectives <b>are</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>engaging,</b> <b>with</b> automatically adapting challenge levels, and they realize motor-cognitive exercises according to specific therapeutic goals. We present the architecture and technical implementation of this system, including specifics in handling a large number of wireless Bluetooth sensors. We outline the scalability of the platform architecture to eventually handle other pathologies and discuss future technical improvements...|$|R
