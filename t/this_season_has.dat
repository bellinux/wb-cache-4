Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the bag with a wide heave that broke the run.

His hitting <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> been hard and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future.

Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now.

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Soulmates" [...] {{demonstrates}} how Parks and Recreation {{is superior to}} other comedy shows because it [...] "invests in its characters and really allows the audience {{time to get to}} know them" [...] rather than depending solely on gags. Alan Sepinwall said he [...] "laughed louder and more frequently at it than any episode so far this season" [...] except for [...] "Flu Season" [...] and called the Ron and Chris subplot as [...] "predictable as hell but perfectly-executed". Sepinwall objected to the introduction of a no-dating policy simply to slow the budding romance between Leslie and Ben, and said [...] "so much of <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> been so perfect that the rare imperfections stand out even more than they would on a weaker overall comedy". Joel Keller of TV Squad said the no-dating policy felt like a plot contrivance meant strictly to keep Ben and Leslie apart, which he felt was not good for the story. However, he complimented Leslie and Tom's scenes together, and said the subplot was even funnier, which he called a [...] "Ron Swanson classic". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said the episode was [...] "a little too disjointed for me", particularly because the two plots were barely associated with each other. However, she said the show included funny individual jokes, and enjoyed the moment when Leslie kissed Tom.|$|E

Dose writer Kat Angus said [...] "Ron and Tammy" [...] solidified Parks and Recreation as [...] "the funniest show on TV this season". Angus praised Offerman's performance and his pairing with Mullally. TV Guide writer Matt Roush, who had previously been very critical of Parks and Recreation, called [...] "Ron and Tammy" [...] "unquestionably the show’s best episode to date". Roush particularly praised the comedic chemistry between Offerman and Mullally, who he said [...] "make beautiful comic music together". Time magazine reviewer James Poniewozik called it an [...] "excellent episode", and said it balanced well the show's formula of comedy focused on people and small-town government. H.T. [...] "Hercules" [...] Strong, a regular columnist with Ain't it Cool News, [...] praised Poehler and Mullally, and said the editing, particularly during the diner scene with Ron and Tammy, was worthy of an Emmy Award nomination.

500|$|For {{the second}} season, 83% of 22 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive, {{with an average}} score of 8.09/10.

[...] Of 22 Metacritic critic reviews, 18 were positive, four were mixed, and none were negative; their average score was 80/100. Early criticism of the show focused on {{the slow pace of}} the second season, particularly the first half. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, described the series as [...] "a nighttime soap", comparing it to [...] "a parody of a Samuel Beckett play" [...] that had very little sense of direction and few appearances of walkers. Nate Rawlings of Times online entertainment section noted that [...] "the pace {{during the first half of}} <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> been brutally slow. [...] They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved." [...] Later reviews from other critics, such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com, recognized the increased quality of the second half, stating it [...] "seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written". Recognizing the overall season, Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant offered praise saying [...] "the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "This episode will strike a chord with anyone that's ever tried {{to fit in with}} the crowd [...] Lisa gets to show the many facets of her character, and there's a superb slapstick sequence as Homer tries to dispose of a firework." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as we do here, and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, as I love watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E

[...] Interesting that last season so many fans were up in arms for the [...] because we didn't get to see enough of the other characters, and this season we're seeing even less of the others, yet no one is complaining. [...] Looks like the writers finally found the right balance." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen thought that the episode [...] "was all about moving all the simmering subplots forward so the next episodes can drive them home". [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! called the episode's final plot twist [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "unexpected". [...] Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones called it the best of the first four episodes of the season with four out of five stars, saying that [...] "the courtroom scenes were very well executed, with a marked difference in the characterisation of Jack [...] has become known as the trustworthy, honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed, so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad reviewed [...] "Eggtown" [...] positively, writing that it [...] "not many shows could mix topics like blackmail, grenades, and motherhood into one episode, but Lost pulled it off." [...] Jon Lachonis of UGO claimed that Lost [...] "again blew everybody's minds" [...] with [...] "Eggtown". [...] BuddyTVs Oscar Dahl commented that [...] "those last few forward scenes were genius.

TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

[...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, citing it as another example of Futurama's [...] "smart takes" [...] on time travel. He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done. Nearly every episode of <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>has</b> been better than the last, and it looks like it's finally reached the peaks it's hit in the past.
