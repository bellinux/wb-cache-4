25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not <b>take</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

500|$|... "Back to the Shack" [...] {{was written}} by Rivers Cuomo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. The song was {{produced}} by Ric Ocasek. Cuomo wrote {{a majority of the}} song, with Karl Koch describing Jacob Kasher Hindlin's contribution to the song as [...] "randomly singing out the title while hanging out on the couch listening to [...] strumming the song. It doesn't <b>take</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> get half a songwriting credit." [...] At one point, the song was performed with the bridge containing the lyric [...] "we belong in the rock zone", before Cuomo, based on fan suggestions changed it from [...] "rock zone" [...] to [...] "rock world". Regarding the composition of the song, Cuomo stated that he [...] "tried to find different melodies and different beats and all these different things." [...] Further, he stated that as he [...] "couldn't crack the code" [...] they had to go ahead and record it anyway. Ocasek introduced a synth melody line to the song during this period.|$|E

500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't <b>take</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E

2500|$|I've {{always been}} an atheist; I've {{always been an}} empiricist really. I've never {{believed}} in ghosts or psychics {{or anything like that}} 'cause it's quite simple—you don't have to know much to go, [...] "Really?" [...] Or, to just apply Occam's Razor, to go, [...] "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" [...] It doesn't <b>take</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.|$|E
