5|$|Arbroath Art Gallery {{occupies}} two galleries above Arbroath Library. It hosts changing {{displays of}} artworks {{from the collection}} of Angus Council and elsewhere. Highlight of the collection include two large oil paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> and Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness.|$|E
5|$|These {{three were}} among those {{commissioned}} to paint {{the walls of the}} Sistine Chapel, the work commencing with Perugino's employment in 1479. Leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission. His first significant commission, The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> for the Monks of Scopeto, was never completed.|$|E
5|$|During the Samaritan {{revolt of}} 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its {{walls and the}} Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, {{supported}} by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing <b>the</b> <b>magi</b> depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.|$|E

5000|$|Warlock and {{the still}} {{inactive}} Gauntlet are captured by <b>the</b> <b>Magus,</b> and both attacked by Doom and Kang. Warlock is defeated and <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> is severely weakened {{in the battle}} and attempts to use the containment units but discovers they have been stolen. Doom betrays and stops Kang, and then demands the Gauntlet from <b>the</b> <b>Magus.</b> Eternity, however, has just been revived and has requested the Gauntlet be reactivated, which the Living Tribunal agrees to. An apparently omnipotent Magus easily defeats Doom and dissolves Quasar, who arrives with the Ultimate Nullifier. Thanos defeats his doppelgänger and distracts <b>the</b> <b>Magus,</b> allowing Warlock {{to grapple with the}} villain for the Gauntlet. Warlock releases from the Gauntlet a being that is a [...] of the entity Eternity and his twin, Infinity. The being incapacitates <b>the</b> <b>Magus,</b> allowing Warlock to absorb <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> into <b>the</b> Soul Gem. The experience places Warlock in a coma.|$|R
50|$|Eternity is {{imprisoned by}} <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> (<b>the</b> evil alter ego of Adam Warlock) who {{attempts}} to reunite the Infinity Gems {{for his own}} use. The villain is eventually defeated when Eternity merges with Infinity and together they strip <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> of his newfound power.|$|R
5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and <b>the</b> <b>Magi.</b> Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{pictures}} of the Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> may include a depiction of the star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the tapestry of the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel.|$|E
50|$|The main character, Gen, is {{released}} from prison by <b>the</b> <b>magus</b> who is <b>the</b> King of Sounis's powerful scholar. <b>The</b> <b>magus,</b> whose name is not revealed, finds Gen to be filthy, uncouth and insolent, but he values Gen's skills as a thief. Without telling Gen where they are going, he takes {{him out of the}} city. They are joined by <b>the</b> <b>magus's</b> two apprentices, Sophos and Ambiades, and by Pol, a soldier.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Magus</b> {{also served}} as an {{advertising}} tool. In it Barrett sought interested people wanting to help form his magic circle. An advertisement in <b>The</b> <b>Magus</b> (Vol. 2, p. 140) refers to an otherwise unknown school founded by Barrett.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>Magus</b> is an older, evil Adam Warlock who {{has traveled}} {{to the past and}} rules a religious empire called the Universal Church of Truth. To ensure his own creation, he guides his younger self through a series of actions that will result in him becoming <b>the</b> <b>Magus.</b> With <b>the</b> aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future and destroys <b>the</b> <b>Magus's</b> timeline, erasing him from existence.|$|R
5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back from the Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Gian Carlo Menotti was {{commissioned}} by NBC's Opera Theatre to write an opera for television. After {{a year and a}} half of delay, he set to work, completing Amahl and the Night Visitors five days before its scheduled airing on Christmas Eve 1951 at 9:30 to 10:30p.m.. Menotti's work was inspired by Hieronymous Bosch's painting, The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi.</b> The composer himself appeared on-screen to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers on-camera to thank them.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family, <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually {{found their way to}} the Vatican. They are dressed anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a hearth representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E

25|$|In {{his travels}} through space, Warlock {{encounters}} the Universal Church of Truth, an intergalactic religious organization led by <b>the</b> corrupt <b>Magus.</b> Warlock allies with Pip the Troll, the assassin Gamora, and Gamora's employer and adoptive father, Thanos of Titan, to oppose <b>the</b> <b>Magus.</b> Eventually, Warlock discovers that <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> is a future version of himself who traveled {{back in time}} after being driven insane {{by the use of}} his Soul Gem. Warlock chooses to alter his timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his own soul to prevent <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> from ever existing. Warlock then continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not knowing exactly when it will happen.|$|R
5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia {{as the source of}} magical ideas. He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara. Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E
5|$|The {{chair of}} Maximian {{in the cathedral}} of Ravenna is {{believed}} to date {{from the middle of}} the 6th century. It is of marble, round, with a high back, and is carved in high relief with figures of saints and scenes from the Gospels—the Annunciation, the Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> the flight into Egypt and the baptism of Christ. The smaller spaces are filled with carvings of animals, birds, flowers and foliated ornament. The Chair of St. Augustine, dating from at least the early thirteenth century is one of the oldest cathedrae is not in use.|$|E

25|$|Moondragon and Phyla-Vell later seek Warlock's help to {{free the}} alien Kree from the invading Phalanx. Once the Phalanx is defeated, Warlock joins the newly formed Guardians of the Galaxy. While with the Guardians, Warlock {{attempts}} to repair damage to the spacetime continuum, which causes him to become <b>the</b> <b>Magus.</b> Once again leading the Universal Church of Truth, <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> allies himself with Lord Mar-Vell, but is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth resurrects <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> as a child, but he is quickly captured and imprisoned by the Annihilators. His cocoon remains under the watch of the Annihilators.|$|R

5|$|The headdress is {{a variant}} of the {{truncated}} or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden. The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which always has a long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way.|$|E
5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo {{and three other}} young men were charged with sodomy but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the Medici had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or <b>the</b> <b>Magi.</b> In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, {{he finds}} the area where <b>the</b> <b>Magus,</b> <b>the</b> foe of the Infinity War, is {{creating}} his evil doubles of all the superheroes. It turns out the Manifestor has other clients also, as such <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> {{does not have an}} unlimited supply. Contemplator uses the energy bubble in his belly button to contact Quasar to convey this information. This distracts Quasar enough for Adam Warlock to temporarily subdue him.|$|R

5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of <b>the</b> <b>Magi</b> triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among <b>the</b> <b>Magi,</b> and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of <b>the</b> <b>Magi.</b> This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
50|$|After {{investigating}} {{the energy of}} the containment units, Thanos discovers <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> and retreats to warn Warlock. Galactus and several of Earth's heroes also investigate and then attempt to revive Eternity, as the entity will be required to petition the Living Tribunal, who has decreed that the Infinity Gems can no longer be used in unison in the Earth-616 universe. The rationale is that if the Gauntlet can be reactivated, then <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> can be removed from existence. <b>The</b> <b>Magus</b> sends <b>the</b> doppelgängers to Earth to distract the heroes, and the evil version of Mister Fantastic detonates a gamma bomb when the heroes assemble at Four Freedoms Plaza, however, the Invisible Woman contains the blast while Thunder God Thor directs the radiation into space, and a surprise attack by <b>the</b> <b>Magus</b> and <b>the</b> doppelgänger of Thanos has the heroes believing the two characters are now allied.|$|R
