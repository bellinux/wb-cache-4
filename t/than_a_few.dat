5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however the British had mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps.

5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E

5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated.

5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera {{on the story of}} the Lorelei.|$|E

5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hops.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense {{is known}} only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite inselberg near Cariamanga in Loja Province, {{southern}} Ecuador, where it occurs {{at an altitude}} of , but only near rocky surfaces. The vegetation is dominated by the molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora). They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain. Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around , and the total population there may not contain more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen individuals. Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable, but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.|$|E

5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment also {{refers to}} the process of aligning such a sequence set. Because three or more sequences of biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise alignment because they are more computationally complex. Most multiple sequence alignment programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.|$|E
