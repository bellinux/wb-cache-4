5|$|In 1996, Hill founded <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Project, a {{non-profit}} outreach organization {{that sought to}} transform the attitudes and behavior of at-risk urban youth. Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange. Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.|$|E

5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship. Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play (due to <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> problem), they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. Since there was no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E

50|$|I {{have seen}} {{most of what}} there is to see in this profession, but what I {{experienced}} on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for <b>the</b> <b>refugees,</b> <b>the</b> Australians sent commando troops on board.

5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
5|$|Petrossian {{originally}} thought {{to write a}} video treatment about a refugee trying to enter the United States, but knew that the band was going to receive several treatments with the same idea. Instead, he decided to portray the plight of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> from a different angle. The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, fair trade, and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E
5|$|The HV offensives {{in western}} Slavonia {{conducted}} in late 1991 (Operations Hurricane-10, Swath-10 and Papuk-91) created {{a total of}} 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled the area when the JNA ordered Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. <b>The</b> <b>refugee</b> resettlement coincided with Croatian Serb efforts to change the ethnic composition of the Danube area seized in late 1991, providing a secondary motive for the expulsion of non-Serb civilians.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} weeks of the war, between 9 February and 9 May, several hundred {{thousand}} German <b>refugees</b> fled across <b>the</b> Baltic Sea, fleeing the advancing Soviet Army.

50|$|In 1964, a {{decision}} was made to move <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> to a new camp constructed on mostly Jewish land near Shuafat.

Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a {{right to keep and}} bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>refugees</b> took <b>the</b> {{invitation}} to be genuine {{and as soon}} as the Left Front government first came to power in Calcutta in 1977, <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> decided to move back to West Bengal. <b>The</b> <b>refugees</b> had a committee named Udbastu Unnyansil Samity who sent representatives to Bengal.

5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of two camps in the Beirut area, the camps were mostly Muslim.

In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to Gaza. However attempts by the Government of Australia to remove Al-Kateb to Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and the Palestinian territories (which would have required the approval of Israel) failed.|$|E
