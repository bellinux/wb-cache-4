The team opted to use Harley sparingly off the bench, with Harley's only meaningful contribution being a late goal scored with his only kick for the game. Returning to the Norwood reserves team, Harley helped the team reach their second successive Grand Final appearance against the Port Magpies and capture the reserves premiership. However, after struggling {{to break into the}} senior side, Harley was traded to Geelong during the off-season for the 37th pick in the 1998 AFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able <b>to</b> <b>ply</b> the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the scaling of transversely loaded carbon/epoxy plates by utilizing ply-level scaling, or geometrically increasing {{the thickness of}} a ply. A scale factor of l= 2 was examined in scaling from 8 <b>to</b> 16 <b>ply,</b> 16 <b>to</b> 32 <b>ply,</b> and 32 <b>to</b> 64 <b>ply</b> laminates. The laminates were loaded until a sudden drop in the recorded load occurred. The specimens were then unloaded. Force-transverse displacement data was monitored for each test. Post test inspection included measuring dent depth, delamination area as seen by xrays and cross-sectional examination. The following conclusions are drawn from this experimental study. · Static indentation measurements of maximum load, maximum deflection and delamination area were more repeatable than dent depth. · Scaled values of load and displacement from smaller specimens were greater than those from full-scale specimens. The largest differences were in scaling from 8 <b>ply</b> <b>to</b> 16 <b>ply</b> specimens, which had a 35 % larger scaled load and 11 % larger scaled displacement. 1...|$|R
5|$|The Caribbean {{initially}} provided England's {{most important}} and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia(1605) and Grenada(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts(1624), Barbados(1627) and Nevis(1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able <b>to</b> <b>ply</b> their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas {{at the expense of}} the Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.|$|E

But competition from the railway, beginning in the 1840s, caused a decline in trade on the river. Proposals to develop a fully navigable river up to Briare came to nothing. The opening of the Canal latéral à la Loire in 1838 enabled navigation between Digoin and Briare to continue, but the river level crossing at Briare remained a problem until the construction of the Briare aqueduct in 1896.

The Tsai-Wu criterion showed similar scenario that ply-by-ply failure index quantities never exceeded one, which indicated no failure occurred. The most likely reason might be due to these polynomial based criteria could not use through-thickness stresses <b>to</b> predict <b>ply</b> failure. Therefore, it can be seen the polynomial failure criteria are not ideal to model composite failure and a ply-by-ply progressive damage method is thus more popular in developing the predictive damage model.|$|R
