5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done already.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant.

She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete.

500|$|Commercially, {{the song}} had limited success, {{reaching}} number 27 on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to peak at 99 Billboard Hot 100. Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do. Sometimes you have to step back and get off the wheel. I didn't have control of the entire creative process.

500|$|His second solo studio record, I See Things Upside Down (2004), {{generated}} mixed reviews. [...] All {{marketing to}} the typical Christian music stations used by his first solo album and his albums with Caedmon's Call was stopped, though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics. [...] In comparison to Webb's previous work, this album has what's {{been referred to as}} an [...] "experimental" [...] style to it, and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect. Webb has stated that the album [...] "was doing away with people's expectations in order to free me up <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." [...] Following the release of I See Things Upside Down, Webb released a live concert DVD, How to Kill and Be Killed (2005).|$|E

It also illustrates vistas from the places he visited and documents national monuments including the Elizabeth Tower, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, Taj Mahal, Giza pyramid complex, the Colosseum and Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. Ludacris, joins Bieber in the video during the rap portion of the song. It also included images of the singer posing with fans, and others crying and screaming for him.|$|E

5000|$|Hope-Evans {{left the}} band {{for over a}} year, and Fiddler, Relf (on bass), and drummer John Davies {{recorded}} the band's third album and last on Dandelion, Dark Side of the Moon. It was released in 1972, {{the year before the}} Pink Floyd album of the same name. According to Nicholas Schaffner, Pink Floyd briefly changed the name of their piece (which they were already performing live), to Eclipse, until the Medicine Head album turned out to be [...] "a commercial dud". The track [...] "Only <b>To</b> <b>Do</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> True" [...] appeared on the 1972 compilation, There Is Some Fun Going Forward.|$|R

500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E
500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with myself <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I kept my emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working and being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago {{and we talked about}} it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{is similar}} to [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] in its lyrics. Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right but I guess I should try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover {{may or may not}} reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a minute," [...] I pleaded. [...] "Will {{you tell}} me what those {{plumbers}} and plasterers and bricklayers that I saw go out just now have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was taught to call the Line?" ...|$|R

500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jeff seemed {{struck by}} this notion. [...] "What {{do you want}} me <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> can <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> Chase myself out of society? Something like that? I'm willing. It's too easy, though. As I said, I've never been wanted much, there, and I shouldn't be missed." ...|$|R
