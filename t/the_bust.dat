5|$|Also {{a copy of}} <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti is {{displayed}} in the foyer of 'The Cleopatra Club'. The film {{is set in the}} 1850s, however <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> wasn't discovered until 1912.|$|E
5|$|The French book, Le Buste de Nefertiti– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (<b>The</b> <b>Bust</b> of Nefertiti– a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art {{historian}} Henri Stierlin {{and the book}} Missing Link in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> to test ancient pigments and that when <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> {{would have been a}} sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for <b>the</b> <b>bust,</b> and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> in Berlin {{was a model}} for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bust</b> of Nefertiti is {{believed}} to have been crafted about 1345BC by the sculptor Thutmose. <b>The</b> <b>bust</b> does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the 'house altar'.|$|E
5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E

50|$|The Long Room {{is lined}} with marble <b>busts.</b> <b>The</b> marble <b>bust</b> {{collection}} was formed when 14 <b>busts</b> from <b>the</b> famous sculptor Peter Scheemakers were acquired by the college.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>busts</b> of Fraser, Hawke, Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard {{were created}} by Peter Nicholson, born in 1946 in Melbourne. He {{is best known for}} his {{cartoons}} in the Nation Review, Financial Review and The Age. Nicholson's works have followed his philosophy that <b>the</b> <b>busts</b> should impart an expression of the character of the individual.|$|R

5|$|A German archaeological {{team led}} by Ludwig Borchardt {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> in 1912 in Thutmose's workshop. It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery, including the cellar of a bank, a salt mine in Merkers-Kieselbach, the Dahlem museum, the Egyptian Museum in Charlottenburg and the Altes Museum. It is currently {{on display at the}} Neues Museum in Berlin, where it was originally displayed before World War II.|$|E
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E

5|$|The same {{building}} {{was also the}} site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. <b>The</b> <b>bust</b> has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made {{at the same time as}} the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. <b>The</b> <b>bust,</b> which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|A bronze bust of James Joule, the {{physicist}} who gave {{his name to}} the SI unit of energy, is in Worthington Park. Originally a tower {{was to have been}} erected in his honour, but lack of donations led to the production of <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> as a substitute; it was unveiled in 1905. Joule moved to Sale in the 1870s for his health; he died at his home at 12Wardle Road in 1889, and is buried in Brooklands Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Between El Hatillo and La Lagunita is {{the smaller}} Manuel Escalona Plaza (Spanish: Plazoleta Manuel Escalona), another urban {{monument}} displaying <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> of Escalona that formerly occupied Bolívar Square. Sucre Plaza (Spanish: Plaza Sucre) – graced since 1915 with a ceiba tree {{at its center}} – is {{in the southern part}} of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners, and it is also known as Plaza La Ceiba. The Four Corners (Spanish: Las Cuatro Esquinas) was a convenient social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait {{for more than a}} year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see <b>the</b> <b>bust,</b> before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E

5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility.

It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing and analysis of <b>the</b> <b>bust</b> have proved it to be authentic.|$|E
