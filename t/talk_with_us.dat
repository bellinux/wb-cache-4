He met up with an old friend, Michael Homerang, who was a highly respected malanggan carver and clan leader (maimai) {{in the village of}} Madina, on the north shore of New Ireland Province in the far north east. Momerang later said [...] "I saw a white man and woman come to my village and sit down to eat and <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> They even slept in our houses. … Only the Almight can make this happen…" [...] Then they met with clan leaders and elders of the community and early in 1958 there were a further 10 conversions who elected the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Papua New Guinea, followed by 30-40 more converts {{over the next four years}} in two villages. 1958 is considered the founding year of the Bahá'í community in Papua New Guinea. Representatives from Papua and New Guinea each (the country was then administered separately) [...] attended the 1958 conference in Australia on the promulgation of the religion.|$|E

60|$|After {{the usual}} salutations, {{and we were}} seated, the President said, in substance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some {{conversation}} with us in explanation of his message of the 6th; that since he had sent it {{in several of the}} gentlemen then present had visited him, but had avoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore inferred that the import of the message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as inimical to the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I was {{astonished}} myself, {{the first time}} I saw him. He is a capital fellow, {{in spite of his}} severity in matters of military etiquette and discipline.

I think that he regards us Scots as being a people for whom allowances must be made, on the ground of our inborn savagery and ignorance of civilized customs. He does not mind plain speaking on our part and, if in the humour, will <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> much more familiarly than he would do to a Prussian officer." ...|$|E
60|$|Within an {{hour after}} the astrologer's <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> Father Peter was in prison and the money sealed up and {{in the hands of the}} {{officers}} of the law. The money was in a bag, and Solomon Isaacs said he had not touched it since he had counted it; his oath was taken that it was the same money, and that the amount was eleven hundred and seven ducats. Father Peter claimed trial by the ecclesiastical court, but our other priest, Father Adolf, said an ecclesiastical court hadn't jurisdiction over a suspended priest. The bishop upheld him. That settled it; the case would go to trial in the civil court. The court would not sit for some time to come. Wilhelm Meidling would be Father Peter's lawyer and do the best he could, of course, but he told us privately that a weak case on his side and all the power and prejudice on the other made the outlook bad.|$|E

"That redskin," [...] said he, [...] "tells me they're on an {{expedition}} to hunt the buffalo on the prairie, and that they're good friends of the white men, {{and would like to}} have a <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> before they go on; but I don't believe 'em. From what I heard Mr McLeod say at the Mountain Fort, I think it not unlikely they are bound on {{an expedition}} against the whites. The very fact of their wishin' to keep friends with us instead of tryin' to lift our scalps and carry off our furs and horses, shows me they've some more pressin' business on hand. Mr McLeod described to me the appearance of one or two o' the Injuns that hates the fur-traders most, so that I might be on my guard, an' I'm quite sure that some of them are with that band. Now, what say ye? Shall I tell 'em we don't want their acquaintance?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah me! {{the world}} grows very full of ghosts {{as we grow}} older. We need not seek in dismal church-yards nor sleep in moated granges to see the shadowy faces and hear the {{rustling}} of their garments in the night. Every house, every room, every creaking chair has its own particular ghost. They haunt the empty chambers of our lives, they throng around us like dead leaves whirled in the autumn wind. Some are living, some are dead. We know not. We clasped their hands once, loved them, quarreled with them, laughed with them, told them our thoughts and hopes and aims, as they told us theirs, till it seemed our very hearts had joined in a grip that would defy the puny power of Death. They are gone now; lost to us forever. Their eyes will never look into ours again and their voices we shall never hear. Only their ghosts come to us and <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> We see them, dim and shadowy, through our tears. We stretch our yearning hands to them, but they are air.|$|E
6000|$|One evening, I remember, he {{came down}} hither, {{designing}} to have a freer <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> We were all sad enough; and strove rather to avoid speaking of what might make us sadder. Before any true talk had been got into, an interruption occurred, some unwelcome arrival; Sterling abruptly rose; gave me the signal to rise; and we unpolitely walked away, adjourning to his Hotel, which I recollect was in the Strand, near Hungerford Market; some ancient comfortable quaint-looking place, off the street; where, in a good warm queer old room, the remainder of our colloquy was duly finished. We spoke of Cromwell, among other things which I have now forgotten; on which subject Sterling was trenchant, positive, and in some essential points wrong,--as I said I would convince him some day. [...] "Well, well!" [...] answered he, {{with a shake of}} the head.--We parted before long; bedtime for invalids being come: he escorted me down certain carpeted backstairs, and would not be forbidden: we took leave under the dim skies;--and alas, little as I then dreamt of it, this, so far as I can calculate, must have been the last time I ever saw him in the world. Softly as a common evening, the last of the evenings had passed away, and no other would come for me forevermore.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed {{the project}} was not so preposterous, {{if they had not}} gone farther; but they neither did, nor {{proposed}} any thing, but what had mischief in the design, or the event. One morning, these three fellows came down to the limited station, and humbly desired to be admitted to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> which we readily granted; they told us in short, that being tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their hands in such employments, not being sufficient to procure the necessaries of life, they only desired one of the canoes we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for their defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more. To be sure we were glad enough to get rid of such wretched plagues; but yet honesty made us ingenuously represent to them, by what we ourselves had suffered, the certain destruction they were running into, either of being starved to death or murdered by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied, that they neither could nor would work: and consequently that they might as well be starved abroad as at home: & neither had they any wives or children to cry after them: nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but the canoe they would have gone without them.|$|E

'Twas {{only our}} duty, my Lady,' gruffly {{answered}} Humfrey; 'but just as Hal had {{got on the}} quay, what should I see but Master Landry coming {{down the street with}} my young Lord in his back! I can tell you he was well-nigh spent; and just then half a dozen butcherly villains came out on him, bawling, [...] "Tu-y! tu-y!" [...] which it seems means [...] "kill, kill." [...] He turned about and showed them that he had got a white sleeve and white cross in his bonnet, like them, the rascals, giving them to understand that he was only going to throw the corpse into the river. I doubted him then myself; but he caught sight of us, and in his fashion of <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> called out to us to help, for there was life still. So two of us took my Lord, and the other three gave the beggarly French cut-throats as good as they meant for us; while Landry shouted to the farmer to wait, and we got aboard, and made right away down the river. But never a word has the poor young gentleman spoken, though Master Landry has done all a barber or a sick-nurse could do; and he got us past the cities by showing the papers in my Lord's pocket, so that we got safe to the farmer's place. There we lay till we could get a boat to Jersey, and thence again home; and maybe my young Lord will mend now Mistress Cecily will have the handing of him.' ...|$|E
60|$|But we linger at Florence {{in spite}} of all. It was {{delightful}} to find ourselves in the old nest, still warm, of Casa Guidi, to sit in our own chairs and sleep in our own beds; and here we shall stay as late perhaps as March, if we don't re-let our house before. Then we go to Rome and Naples. You can't think how we have caught up our ancient traditions just where we left them, and relapsed into our former soundless, stirless hermit life. Robert has not passed an evening from home since we came--just {{as if we had}} never known Paris. People come sometimes to have tea and <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> but that's all; a few intelligent and interesting persons sometimes, such as Mr. Tennyson (the poet's brother) and Mr. Lytton (the novelist's son) and Mr. Stuart, the lecturer on Shakespeare, whom once I named to you, I fancy. Mr. Tennyson married an Italian, and has four children. He has much of the atmosphere poetic about him, a dreamy, speculative, shy man, reminding us of his brother in certain respects; good and pure-minded. I like him. Young Mr. Lytton is very young, as you may suppose, with all sorts of high aspirations--and visionary enough to suit me, which is saying much--and affectionate, with an apparent liking to us both, which is engaging to us, of course. We have seen the Trollopes once, the younger ones, but the elder Mrs. Trollope was visible neither at that time nor since....|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think the}} admiral's <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> this {{afternoon}} {{had an excellent}} effect, Gervaise. I do not say that every one was not before disposed to obey you in all things, willingly and cheerfully; but he put it so strongly {{to them that they}} had volunteered specially for service in this galley, knowing well who was to be its commander, and the circumstance that the crew was to consist solely of young knights, and had therefore specially pledged their honour so to act that the enterprise should be in all respects a successful one. To render it so, obedience was even a greater necessity than valour. This was the most important of all the vows taken by the knights of the Order, and it was only by the strictest and most unquestioning obedience on the part of all to the orders of their superiors, that the work of a vast community could be carried on. Passing over the fact that you were their superior in rank, both as being a secular knight and a knight commander of the Order, you had been specially appointed by the grand master and council, as well as by himself, and that they bestowed upon you while at sea, {{and in the absence of}} any officers of superior rank, their full powers and authority. You were, in fact, their representative and agent, and therefore to be regarded with the same deference and respect that would be due to the oldest knight similarly placed. 'Lastly,' he said, in a less serious tone, 'you must remember that this is an experiment, and, as some think, a somewhat rash one. Never before did a galley, manned entirely from among the youngest of our knights, put to sea; and you may be sure that, unless successful, the experiment is not likely to be ever repeated. You have been selected from among many other candidates, and you have not only to justify the choice, but to uphold the reputation and honour of the young knights of your Order, by all of whom your doings will be regarded with special interest, as reflecting credit not only upon yourselves individually, but as representatives and champions of them all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I then bade {{her call}} out to {{the queen of the}} little people to come and <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> There was, however, no answer to her command. I {{therefore}} repeated the words aloud myself, and in a moment a very beautiful tall woman came out of the cave. I too had by this time fallen into a kind of trance, in which what we call the unreal had begun to take upon itself a masterful reality, and was able to see the faint gleam of golden ornaments, the shadowy blossom of dim hair. I then bade the girl tell this tall queen to marshal her followers according to their natural divisions, that we might see them. I found as before that I had to repeat the command myself. The creatures then came out of the cave, and drew themselves up, if I remember rightly, in four bands. One of these bands carried quicken boughs in their hands, and another had necklaces made apparently of serpents' scales, but their dress I cannot remember, for I was quite absorbed in that gleaming woman. I asked her to tell the seer whether these caves were the greatest faery haunts in the neighbourhood. Her lips moved, but the answer was inaudible. I bade the seer lay her hand upon the breast of the queen, and after that she heard every word quite distinctly. No, this was not the greatest faery haunt, for there was a greater one a little further ahead. I then asked her whether it was true that she and her people carried away mortals, and if so, whether they put another soul in the place of the one they had taken? [...] "We change the bodies," [...] was her answer. [...] "Are any of you ever born into mortal life?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Do I know any who were among your people before birth?" [...] "You do." [...] "Who are they?" [...] "It would not be lawful for you to know." [...] I then asked whether she and her people were not [...] "dramatizations of our moods"? [...] "She does not understand," [...] said my friend, [...] "but says that her people are much like human beings, and do most of the things human beings do." [...] I asked her other questions, as to her nature, and her purpose in the universe, but only seemed to puzzle her. At last she appeared to lose patience, for she wrote this message for me upon the sands--the sands of vision, not the grating sands under our feet--"Be careful, and do not seek to know too much about us." [...] Seeing that I had offended her, I thanked her for what she had shown and told, and let her depart again into her cave. In a little while the young girl awoke out of her trance, and felt again the cold wind of the world, and began to shiver.|$|E
