25|$|However, the 'Bandić problem' {{escalated}} in {{the coming}} months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying {{that he was one of}} the founders of SDP emphasizing that he stood with the party through the good and <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>times.</b> Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP membership card nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's membership card number was 38159.|$|E

[...] Dan Aquilante from New York Post said that the concert [...] "razzle-dazzled her way into the hearts of the devoted audience with an entertaining theatrical revue that was elaborately staged, costumed and cast with a full dance troupe." [...] Thea Singer of the Boston Herald said that [...] "Madonna brought Jewish mysticism on tour." [...] John Hand from BBC noted that the [...] "Re-Invention Tour happily marrie past and present Madonna. [...] It is a far more rounded concert experience for the dedicated fan."

2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>times</b> and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
