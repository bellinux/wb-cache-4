5|$|On 3 April 2007, Rollcentre Racing {{announced}} that its LMP2 Radical-Judd entry had been withdrawn due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> being purchased by Embassy Racing. The PSI Experience Chevrolet Corvette C6.R took its {{place on the}} entry list.|$|E
5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains {{immobile}} in {{his chair}} all day due to a hernia which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on his office chair {{to bring him to}} the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was {{involved}} in. He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that {{the truth of what}} was done to him may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and walking away.|$|E
5000|$|In Power Mode, {{the hybrid}} system is {{optimised}} <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>the</b> best possible performance. The electric motor's quick torque delivery contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> 0 <b>to</b> 100 kph acceleration time of 6.1 seconds.|$|R

25|$|In the station, a kicker tyre {{system is}} used <b>to</b> propel <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into <b>the</b> launch, and also <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> {{returning}} <b>car.</b> Once in <b>the</b> launch, a {{linear synchronous motor}} (LSM) system is used <b>to</b> accelerate <b>the</b> <b>car</b> along <b>the</b> horizontal part of the track, and also <b>to</b> slow <b>the</b> returning <b>car.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1903 the District tested two seven-car trains with {{different}} control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand operated sliding {{doors on the}} car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the Arena Zytek led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> being {{withdrawn}} during scrutineering {{a week and a}} half later, just before the actual race. The team decided that it was not able to repair the damage in time for the car to pass scrutineering.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the station is a pay and display car park with 285 car parking spaces, six {{motorcycle}} spaces and a number of cycle racks. Cycle storage is also available. The car park is run by North Somerset Council. There is a bus stop adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park, with services between Bristol and Nailsea.|$|E

5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, left at the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two rail cars that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{ordered by the}} Reading, these rail cars were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced with conventional trucks. After being retrofitted, these cars {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin rail cars. They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short line that operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the March {{team was}} sold, and {{became known as}} Leyton House. Gugelmin was once again partnered by Capelli, but the team's CG901 chassis proved {{troublesome}} and between them they failed to qualify six times, including at the Mexican Grand Prix. However, at the next race, the French Grand Prix, modifications had been made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> which improved the performance. Running the whole race without changing their tyres, Capelli and Gugelmin ran first and second during the race. Gugelmin retired mid-race with engine problems and Capelli was passed by Alain Prost for the lead late in the race. Gugelmin also scored a point for finishing sixth in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{was first}} {{designated}} in May or June 1928 {{from the north}} city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River, {{but not all of}} it was built and open to traffic. It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E

5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which {{survivors}} {{from the war}} have gathered. The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. Players can find more powerful guns to attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies.|$|E
5|$|They move {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} {{the upper part of the}} sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all but disappeared. The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity. This stands at the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.|$|E

Ignoring the wheel clamp, he tries to accelerate {{and in the process}} destroys the car's fender. Homer stops by a road construction crew and steals a jackhammer so he can use it to remove the clamp. The car is freed from the clamp, but further damaged as a result. Homer races to Central Park and reunites with his family. While driving back to Springfield, the family reflects on their wonderful time, while Homer's hatred for New York remains.|$|E
5|$|With two Audis out, {{this left}} the lone No. 1 Audi {{to take over}} the race lead, with the two Peugeots four and six laps behind respectively. Just before to the No. 2 Audi's accident, the GT1-leading Aston Martin had also come off the track, {{damaging}} its front splitter. The necessary repairs led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> spending eight minutes in the garage, dropping it to fourth in class. The lone factory Corvette gained a place to take over second in class. Scuderia Ecosse's Ferrari briefly took over the GT2 lead after Risi's problems, but it too broke down on the track, handing the lead to the IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche. Binnie Motorsport's entry had a sizable lead in its class, having not suffered the many problems its LMP2 competitors had.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
