5|$|In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued {{on behalf}} of the United States <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> care and not {{educational}} curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.|$|E
30|$|All {{respondents}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> had a {{legal right}} to see their radiology reports if they wished/requested, but the survey indicated that routine practice varies across Europe. Slightly under half of respondents indicated <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> routinely received reports and approximately one quarter <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> rarely received them. Nine per cent of respondents replied <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> never receive written reports. Free text comments indicated that practice may vary across individual healthcare systems, with differences between private and state run services, and inpatient or outpatient referrals. It is clear that although the legal right exists, in practice this may be expensive to implement routinely and difficult to achieve. There is also the perceived risk <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> could be unnecessarily alarmed by radiology reports {{that need to be}} explained in person and {{in the context of their}} illness.|$|R

5|$|Some of a patient's single {{nucleotide}} polymorphismsslight {{differences in their}} DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called pharmacogenomics. For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and {{find out whether the}} drugs will be fully effective for <b>that</b> <b>patient.</b> Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} home testing {{is the evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> self-testing with medical support and patient self-management (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control.

25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel {{was that the}} {{subjects}} were randomly allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on {{the order in which}} they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E
25|$|When {{a patient}} in Somerset died of low blood sugar in October 2003, the medical center alerted state authorities. <b>That</b> <b>patient</b> was Cullen's final victim. State {{officials}} castigated the hospital for failing to report a nonfatal insulin overdose, administered by Cullen, in August. An investigation into Cullen's employment history revealed past suspicions about his involvement with prior deaths. Somerset Medical Center fired Cullen on October 31, 2003, ostensibly for lying on his job application. Fellow nurse Amy Loughren alerted the police after becoming alarmed about Cullen's records of accessing drugs and links to patient deaths. Police kept him under surveillance for several weeks, until they had finished their investigation.|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic cloning is {{achieved}} by creating embryonic stem cells {{in the hopes of}} treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.|$|E
30|$|In particular, Walker et al.

25|$|A recent ABC-TV 20/20 {{report on}} Healthcare, based on footage taken {{from within the}} island, criticized Michael Moore's portrayals of the Cuban Healthcare system in the movie Sicko. In that film, Moore took a number of Americans to a {{hospital}} in Havana where they bought affordable drugs, and were given treatments for free that they could not afford in America. The report highlights the dilapidated conditions of some hospitals that are accessible to regular Cubans by pointing to the bleak conditions of hospital rooms and the filthy conditions of the facilities. The report also addressed the quality of care available to Cubans by arguing <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> neglect was a common phenomenon. Finally, in discussing the infant mortality rate, the report highlights the government's alleged efforts to promote abortions of potentially infirm fetuses and other alleged government efforts to manipulate the rate.|$|E
25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB {{should not be}} accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment {{is crucial to the}} management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating <b>that</b> <b>patient.</b> The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E
25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E

25|$|While {{the number}} of nurses {{providing}} patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing {{is directly related to}} patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> death, nosocomial infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios. The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric nursing care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses {{play a key role in}} successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patient’s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.|$|E
25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing spironolactone pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims have}} been officially {{certified}} (1,784 {{of whom have}} died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they are not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full epidemiological study has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came {{out into the open}} about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that {{some of the people who}} sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.|$|E
