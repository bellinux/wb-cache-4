5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

500|$|We {{wanted to}} make a {{specific}} story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations. I'm not saying that all couples fight <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> just want people {{just to be able to}} identify with the characters and recognize that they've seen relationships like this where two people are together that are completely wrong for each other and things spiral out of control.... Megan was the key to this video.... I'll tell you as a director the reason why [...] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] is a doo-wop style pop shuffle {{song and}} opened the second side of Like a Prayer. It begins {{with the sound of}} synths and {{keyboard}} and Madonna repeatedly singing the words [...] "cherish, cherish". This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always having you here by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never felt <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> bet, So don't underestimate my point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} references to pop culture. George explains that he broke the original statue when he was {{using it as a}} microphone, singing the song [...] "MacArthur Park", by Jimmy Webb; in early drafts of the script, George broke it while singing Eddie Cochran's [...] "Summertime Blues". The episode also contained numerous references to the 1960s television crime drama Dragnet,. This was because Larry Charles, who wrote the episode, watched a lot of reruns of the show when he was writing for Seinfeld. The cop Kramer pretends to be when he retrieves the statue was inspired by Joe Friday, the central character of Dragnet. Finland is also mentioned multiple times, as Rava is from there. At the end of the episode Kramer states [...] "Well, lets put it <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> didn't take them to The People's Court", a reference to the judicial television show.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can let [...] know if any extra coverage is needed", he explained. [...] "Often I’ll get word to the 1st [...] and he’ll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although I will have a first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we’ll stop and address it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the shows {{revolves}} around Beyoncé's recording career, from her early childhood beginnings to the star she is today. She revealed, [...] "In the beginning, I'm gonna start out, sing and make it about my songwriting, my arrangements, my band and my love for music. Then, I'm gonna tell my story. <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant {{more than just the}} chorus that's catchy... it's my life." [...] Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, [...] "Ego", [...] "At Last", [...] "Listen", [...] "Ring the Alarm", and [...] "Upgrade U". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments. The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act.|$|E
500|$|Weingartner said he {{received}} an offer large enough that [...] "I {{would not have to}} work {{for the rest of my}} life" [...] from an American studio but refused it, opting to produce the film with his own studio, y3film, and coop99, an Austrian studio. A low-budget film, it was funded by a €250,000 loan Weingartner obtained with his parents' house as collateral. His second feature film, The Edukators was shot with hand-held digital cameras, allowing the director [...] "to explore the space and give actors license to go wherever they wanted." [...] Weingartner wanted a technically simple film focused on the actors. His decision to have a low budget was measured: [...] "More money means more pressure. <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> used a limited crew and was able to set the shooting schedule the way I wanted it - usually. The huge advantage of this kind of film-making is that it's rapid." [...] Most of the film was shot in Berlin, except for scenes in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
5000|$|Anne Murray and Gene MacLellan had {{met while}} both were regulars on the CBC {{television}} series Singalong Jubilee and Murray recorded two of MacLellan's compositions, [...] "Snowbird" [...] and [...] "Biding My Time", {{for her first}} major label album release, <b>This</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Is</b> My <b>Way,</b> in 1969. Murray would recall: [...] "Gene told me he wrote [...] "Snowbird" [...] in twenty minutes while walking {{on a beach in}} PEI." ...|$|R

500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E

2500|$|Some Romans {{found it}} all a bit much.

2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rollins told Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald {{that this}} reunion with Haskett, Gibbs and Cain would not become {{long-term}} unless the group {{decided to write}} new songs: [...] "Let's put it <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{want to go out}} and hit America again without a new record, or at least a new album's worth of material. Otherwise the thing will lack legitimacy ... Miles Davis would never do that. And I'm not into a greatest-hits thing. I think a band, if you're going to be around, you should be moving forward and putting in the time and working for it, getting after the art. Otherwise you're just playing retreads. ... Imagine a tree that grows canned peaches. It's nothing I want to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{makes this}} clear in section 258: [...] "A {{definition}} surely serves {{to establish the}} meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But [...] "I impress it on myself" [...] can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness." [...] This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.|$|E
6000|$|Still {{oppressed by}} {{reflections}} which {{pointed to the}} future in <b>this</b> discouraging <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> was startled by a voice outside the door--a sweet, sad voice--saying, [...] "May I come in?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Facing up to 3.5 {{years in}} {{military}} prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack {{and stated that}} he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service. [...] He requested that the jury allow him to continue {{his career in the}} military ("I don't want it to end <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> want to continue to serve"), and that he would now undertake his deployment if he could, even with his concerns about the president unaddressed. [...] The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a [...] "compassionate physician" [...] who always volunteered to help when needed. [...] The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1926, the University of Kansas {{announced}} that it had hired Cappon as its new football coach.

[...] Little said {{he had tried to}} take Cappon with him to Wisconsin and called Cappon [...] "one of the most promising coaches of recent graduation in the United States." [...] On his first visit to Lawrence, Kansas, Cappon told reporters: [...] "I always have heard of the clean, fine sportsmanship in the Missouri Valley conference, and I am glad to be coming out <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> ... <b>I</b> hope we may turn out a football team that will be a credit to the Valley and in every way uphold Valley traditions for clean play and sportsmanship." [...] In two seasons as the football coach at Kansas, Cappon's record was 5–10–1. [...] According to a 1940 history of football at the University of Kansas, Cappon resigned after two years at Kansas {{as the result of a}} controversy over [...] "scouting." [...] The Missouri Valley conference schools had agreed [...] "not to 'scout' each other in the belief that such a practice was unsportsmanlike." [...] After Kansas beat Missouri 14–7 with a new passing attack and [...] "impregnable defense," [...] Missouri produced evidence to show that Kansas supporters, not part of the Kansas staff, had acted as [...] "volunteer scouts" [...] at Missouri games and had provided Cappon with [...] "charts of the Tiger plays," [...] that enabled Cappon to develop new schemes to stop the Missouri offense.
