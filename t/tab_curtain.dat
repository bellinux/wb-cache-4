50|$|The {{auditorium}} is fan-shaped {{and decorated}} {{in gold and}} burgundy with seating for 3,794 and 245 standing positions on six levels. Over 4,000 squares of gold leaf cover the domed petal-shaped ceiling from which the 21 crystal chandeliers hang. The walls of the auditorium are paneled in kevazingo bubinga, a rosewood noted for its acoustic quality. The auditorium {{is known to be}} acoustically significant—small conversation and quiet moments in music can be heard well {{at the top of the}} Family Circle (some 146 ft away from the stage). As a result, the Opera House is the only Lincoln Center auditorium that has not been rebuilt because of acoustic problems. The square gold proscenium is 54 ft wide and 54 ft high. The main curtain of custom-woven gold damask is the largest <b>tab</b> <b>curtain</b> in the world. Above the proscenium is an untitled bronze sculpture by Mary Callery. The orchestra pit is very large and open to the auditorium, with the capacity for up to 110 musicians.|$|E
50|$|Two sets of <b>tabs</b> (<b>curtains)</b> {{are also}} {{installed}} {{and used for}} most performances. The cinema houses all major digital sound systems: Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, Dolby Digital and DTS. It had the UK's first wide-screen installed in 1953, and more recently, {{was the first to}} have a digital projector installed in 1999.|$|R

50|$|The {{auditorium}} was {{a cavernous}} space, with textured panelling {{on both side}} walls, partially concealing curtained backing. Variable lighting was installed in the outer rim of the ceiling to play different coloured schemes over the walls during intermissions. A single set of <b>tabs</b> (<b>curtains)</b> revealed the immense screen. Foyer areas were reached via escalator from a ground floor box office with a fish pond in the upper foyer. A somewhat flatter screen was installed following the revival of Lawrence of Arabia {{to allow for a}} less distorted view of the desert skylines. Digital sound was installed in the 1990s, including ceiling speakers.|$|R
5000|$|Ready made fabrics (eyelet and <b>tab</b> panels, café-style <b>curtains</b> {{and roman}} blinds...) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tab</b> top <b>curtains</b> {{are made}} with narrow straps, that loop or tie at the top edge and hung from the curtain pole. This curtain style is often {{designed}} as two stationary panels {{at the sides of}} a window.|$|R
5000|$|The {{playback}} of {{the content}} {{is controlled by the}} server using a [...] "playlist". As the name implies, this is {{a list of all the}} content that is to be played as part of the performance. The playlist will be created by a member of the theatre's staff using proprietary software that runs on the server. In addition to listing the content to be played the playlist also includes automation cues that allow the playlist to control the projector, the sound system, auditorium lighting, <b>tab</b> <b>curtains</b> and screen masking (if present), etc. The playlist can be started manually, by clicking the [...] "play" [...] button on the server's monitor screen, or automatically at pre-set times.|$|R
50|$|The tableau, <b>tab,</b> or <b>tabbed</b> <b>curtain,</b> {{also called}} opera drapes, though iconic {{of the theater}} setting, is the rarest of {{curtains}} to actually be employed on the stage. It consists of two overlapping panels (often but not always pleated) secured along the top to a batten, with the lower onstage corners or center points of the panel edges attached to lines or cables. These lines run through series of rings behind each curtain diagonally, and then through pulleys in the batten {{and down to the}} floor. When the cord is pulled, the fabric is lifted diagonally up and out, away from the center. In this position, it does not fully clear the stage, instead creating a frilled tent-like viewing frame for the performance- it is because of this tendency to limit the audience's view that it is rarely used except in very small venues. However, as the top of the curtain never moves, it requires no track (like a traveler curtain) and as the curtain itself is never actually raised, neither does it require any sandbag counterweights (like an oleo or an Austrian).|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{suggestions}} for {{the origin of}} the word [...] "tab". It is often said to be derived from [...] "tabloid", as in the short form of a newspaper. Alternatively, it could refer to [...] "tableau" [...] as in the <b>tab</b> style of <b>curtain</b> across the front of a stage, since the curtain and a few pieces of furniture might be the only scenery used by a tab show.|$|R
