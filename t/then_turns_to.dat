5|$|South of Willow Run, the Interstate {{parallels}} {{the north shore}} of Belleville Lake. East of the water body, it intersects I-275 near the northwest corner of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and angles northeasterly through the southwestern Detroit suburbs along the Detroit Industrial Freeway. I-94 uses the Gateway Bridge over the single-point interchange at US24 (Telegraph Road) in Taylor; these bridges were inspired by Super Bowl XL and provide a western entrance to the city. Further east, the Interstate intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and passes the Uniroyal Giant Tire in Allen Park.

After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and {{spent the rest of the}} day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Granny's home. The investigation <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of Dumpford, a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst, is Terwick Mill. It is a grade II* listed structure, and {{consists}} of two mills, side by side. They were operational until 1966. The north mill is a timber-framed building, clad with weatherboarding, dating from the sixteenth century. The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750. Although it has {{been converted into a}} house, it still contains two iron waterwheels, one for each mill, and its machinery. The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635. The adjacent mill house, parts of which date from the eighteenth century, is also a listed building. The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton, and is crossed by Trotton Bridge, dating from the early 1600s, which has five ribbed arches. The river <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the east again at Chithurst, where Abbey House, an L-shaped timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, and the parish church, much of which dates from the eleventh century, are located on the north bank. An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river.|$|E
5|$|Months later, Ste {{returns and}} seeks Amy's help. After convincing her he has changed, Amy gives Ste a second chance. Amy's father Mike attacks Ste, but is told by Amy that Ste is her {{daughter}} Leah's father. Ste and Amy become a couple again {{and move into}} a flat of their own. Mike contacts Ste's stepfather Terry, who arrives and beats up Ste. Amy then throws Mike out. To help with their money worries, Ste steals Warren Fox's (Jamie Lomas) credit card. With this, he buys expensive belongings for the flat.

5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids.

After crossing the Connoquenessing Creek, the PA65/PA288 concurrency comes to an end while PA65 travels north as North Street, <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the east to become Line Avenue, and then shifts towards the north as New Castle Road then becoming Ellwood Road.|$|E
25|$|By 1944, all forty {{volumes of}} the First Encyclopedia of Tlön are {{discovered}} and published in a library in Memphis. The material then becomes accessible worldwide, and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually disintegrating and transforming into Tlön. Borges <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial into Spanish. Arguably {{it is no more}} important than Tlön, but it is at least of his world.|$|E

He again eviscerates the Pandavas for all their chicanery during the war and decries their legacy. Venerating his own character, Duryodhana proclaims he will die happily. Duryodhana <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> Krishna and {{specifically}} accuses him of engineering his defeat, calling Krishna the most sinful of the lot.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|Most modern Chinese {{dictionaries}} and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use {{the traditional}} radical-based character index {{in a section}} at the front, while {{the main body of}} the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their pinyin spelling.

The character's entry will have the character's pronunciation in pinyin written down; the reader <b>then</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the main dictionary section and looks up the pinyin spelling alphabetically.|$|E
