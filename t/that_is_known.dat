5|$|All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Cho {{offered some}} of the {{earliest}} contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> in both North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> from fossils {{uncovered}} in modern-day Portugal. It {{may represent a}} species of Supersaurus. The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis, first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some other material from the Lourinhã Formation. Although the precise age of the formation is not known, it can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic.|$|E

5|$|The Great Gatsby (1926), by Herbert Brenon– {{a silent}} movie of a stage adaptation, {{starring}} Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson, and William Powell. It is a famous {{example of a}} lost film.

5|$|The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season occurs from June to July in Jamaica, and from April to July in Hispaniola. When breeding, the golden swallow usually nests in pairs and occasionally will nest in colonies. This swallow {{is not known}} to compete for nests with any other birds. The only species, an insect, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to inhabit nest boxes occupied by golden swallows is Polyancistrus loripes, a species of katydid. Only about 9.6% of nesting attempts are second nesting attempts, although this number may be low.|$|E

5|$|The little <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} {{that he was an}} early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded in {{the last decade of the}} thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this statement is inference as their diet isn't described. All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> is that it sticks to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle {{is a native}} insect species <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of lodgepole pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E

5|$|Tungsten is {{the only}} metal from the third {{transition}} series <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E

5|$|William de Corbeil was {{probably}} born at Corbeil on the Seine, possibly in about 1070. He was educated at Laon, {{where he studied}} under Anselm of Laon, the noted scholastic and teacher of theology. William taught for a time at Laon, but nothing else is known of his early life. All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of his parents or ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot; his brothers appear as witnesses on William's charters.|$|E
5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric (killed circa 636) was a king of East Anglia, the {{independent}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom that today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He {{was a member}} of the ruling Wuffingas dynasty, but his relationship with other known members of the dynasty is not known with any certainty. Anna of East Anglia may have been his brother, or his cousin. It has also been suggested that he was identical with Æthelric, who married Hereswith and was the father of Ealdwulf of East Anglia. The primary source for the little <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about Ecgric's life is Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum.|$|E
