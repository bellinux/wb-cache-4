5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E

Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that}} the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the ears short {{can be used as}} a preventative method to ear problems.|$|E

25|$|Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. For {{the pivotal}} role of Carlito's sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early {{retirement}} by {{the challenge of}} playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie The Crossing Guard and work with Pacino. De Palma and Penn sat down and discussed what '70s mob lawyers looked like. Often, men {{in the entertainment business}} can look more bizarre than the talent they represent. Penn shaved <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the front of his forehead to give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest.

25|$|Some bog bodies, such as Tollund Man from Denmark, {{have been}} found with the rope used to {{strangle}} them still around their necks.

Some of the bog bodies seem consistently to have been members of the upper class: their fingernails are manicured, and tests on hair protein routinely record good nutrition. Strabo records that the Celts practiced auguries on the entrails of human victims: on some bog bodies, such as the Weerdinge Men found in the northern Netherlands, the entrails have been partly drawn out through incisions.|$|E

25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days was long gone along with most of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> top of his head. In the brief film clip, he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson.

25|$|The fan and {{fly-whisk}} are items used {{to comfort}} and cool, an important accessory for a divine king {{especially in a}} tropical country. The Royal Fan (พัดวาลวิชนี) was created by order of King Rama I. The fan is gilded with gold, the handle enamelled in green and red. Traditionally a fan was made by bending a talipot palm's frond at a right angle; the royal fan mimics this traditional form. The Royal Fly-whisk of the yak's tail (พระแส้หางจามรี) {{was made in the}} reign of King Rama IV to augment the five items of the regalia. Evidently associated with the same idea of divine comfort as the fan, it is actually derived from the ancient chāmara of India. According to tradition, the fly-whisk was used by the king to repel any maleficent forces that might bring discomfort to his subjects. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the royal fly-whisk has since been replaced by those of a white elephant.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the period, men wore {{their hair}} long with curls {{well past the}} shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the {{forehead}} a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, {{the popularity of the}} wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due {{to the success of the}} wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs.|$|E

25|$|The forest wildcat's fur {{is fairly}} uniform in length {{throughout}} the body. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> the tail is {{very long and}} dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the guard hairs measure 7cm, the tip hairs 5.5–6cm, and the underfur 4.5–5.5cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5–6.7cm, 4.5–6cm, and 5.3cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light gray, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating {{at the base of}} the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light gray, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2–3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter gray around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are almost imperceptible.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong boxed as {{an amateur}} before turning {{professional}} in June 1995. He chose the professional surname [...] "Gomez" [...] when the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) required him to select another name {{at the time of}} his registration as a professional; there was another boxer in the same weight division using the name [...] "Michael Armstrong". He chose his ring name in honour of Puerto Rican boxer Wilfredo Gómez, whose videotaped fights Armstrong had studied intently as a youth.

He developed a ring persona based on this nickname, which has remained popular with fans throughout his career. His ring entrance music is that of a Mexican Mariachi band, a reference to his Hispanic-sounding chosen name, and many of his supporters wear sombreros to his fights and wave Irish flags.
