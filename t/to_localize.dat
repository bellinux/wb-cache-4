5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a small}} {{customer}} base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for {{the game in the}} media. <b>To</b> <b>localize</b> the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing female barbarian on the box covers outside Japan. The Western version of Alisia was likened to the scantily clad females in artist Boris Vallejo's work.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.

This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not {{released}} outside Japan: no explanation {{was given by}} Nintendo, although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its exclusivity to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release: an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringers text-heavy approach {{made it more difficult}} and thus less appealing <b>to</b> <b>localize.</b> To date, it remains exclusive to Japan.

5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} work, celebrity {{copywriter}} Shigesato Itoi pitched to the company's lead designer Shigeru Miyamoto, his {{idea for a}} role-playing game set in contemporary times. The modern setting worked against role-playing genre norms, and while Miyamoto liked the idea, he was hesitant until Itoi could show full commitment to the project. Itoi reduced his workload, formed a team, and began development in Ichikawa, Chiba. Nintendo tried to accommodate Itoi's ideal work environment to feel more like an extracurricular club of volunteers. Itoi wrote the game's script. Mother was developed by Ape, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan). The game was slated for an English-language localization as Earth Bound, but was abandoned when the team chose <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> Mother 2 instead. Years later, the complete localization was recovered by the public and distributed on the Internet, where it became known as EarthBound Zero. Mother received its English language debut in June 2015 as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, 2012 Square Enix {{announced}} that they were remaking Dragon Quest VII exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS {{and that it would}} be released in Japan in February 2013. Later that day, Square Enix confirmed that the release date would be February 7, 2013 for Japan. Similarly to Dragon Quest IX, the game features visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, unique backgrounds and enemies that have individual attack characteristics. The remake was originally not intended for a release outside of Japan, in part due to the sheer cost and time needed <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> the game's substantial content. After numerous letters from core Dragon Quest fans in France, as well as Square Enix and Nintendo executives, the decision was made to release the 3DS port worldwide. In the November 2015 Nintendo Direct, it was shown that Dragon Quest VII would be coming outside Japan in 2016, with the new subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. The international release of the 3DS remake contained a completely retranslated script which followed the localization style of games since Square Enix's release of Dragon Quest VIII in 2005, including numerous name and terminology changes for characters from the original Dragon Warrior VII release. The orchestral score from the Japanese release was also replaced with a synthesized MIDI soundtrack used by the iOS and Android versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{official}} announcement of its western release, Bravely Default was cited by multiple journalists {{as a game}} that should be localized for western markets.

A localization was officially announced in April 2013. Nintendo took charge of publishing duties overseas. The western version was based on the For the Sequel expanded version. It released in Europe on December 6, 2013. An earlier false report in Nintendo's financial report indicated that its European release would be in 2014, but this was later corrected by Nintendo of Europe. In Australia, it released on December 7. In North America, it released on February 7, 2014. Both in North America and the UK, a collector's edition was created including the soundtrack, an artbook, and over thirty AR cards. The UK edition also included a figurine of Agnès. It was also released in South Korea on April 16, although it was not localized into Korean, placing it in contrast with other Nintendo releases such as Shin Megami Tensei IV.|$|E

Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E
5|$|The first Fire Emblem title, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, was {{originally}} never {{intended as a}} commercial game, defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a dōjin project with three other job-holding students. As it turned out, the game was successful, prompting {{the development of more}} games in the series. The game was developed at Intelligent Systems, whose previous notable game was the strategy game Famicom Wars. Kaga would work on the Fire Emblem series until Thracia 776, when he left Nintendo and began development on Tear Ring Saga for the PlayStation. After Thracia 776, the Fire Emblem series had several releases on portable devices. At this time, Marth and Roy from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Sword of Seals appeared as playable characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, prompting western interest in the Fire Emblem series. The positive reception of the characters made Nintendo decide <b>to</b> <b>localize</b> Blazing Sword under the title Fire Emblem. Due to its overseas success, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for Path of Radiance for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series. By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next Fire Emblem failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be cancelled. This prompted Intelligent Systems to include lots of features new to the series, intending to make it the culmination of the series. The game's reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation, convincing Nintendo to continue production.|$|E
