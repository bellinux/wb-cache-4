5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the <b>target</b> <b>value.</b> If the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the <b>target</b> <b>value).</b> Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> {{is greater}} than the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E

40|$|In Quality Function Deployment, {{determination}} of the <b>target</b> <b>values</b> for engineering requirements {{is the most difficult}} process. A fuzzy optimization model is presented for the {{determination of}} <b>target</b> <b>values</b> for engineering requirements in Quality Function Deployment. An inexact genetic algorithm approach was introduced to solve the model that takes the mutation along the weighted gradient direction as a genetic operator. Instead of obtaining one set of exact optimal <b>target</b> <b>values,</b> the approach can generate a family of inexact optimal <b>target</b> <b>values</b> setting within an acceptable satisfaction degree. Through an interactive approach, a design team can determine a combination of preferred solution sets from which a set of preferred <b>target</b> <b>values</b> of engineering requirements based on a specific design scenario can be obtained.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} <b>target</b> <b>value</b> within a sorted array. Binary search compares the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|Rank queries can be {{performed}} using {{a modified version of}} binary search. By returning m on a successful search, and L on an unsuccessful search, the number of elements less than the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is returned instead.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the <b>target</b> <b>value.</b> Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E

5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} position of a <b>target</b> <b>value.</b> However, due to the ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E

An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines.

In all of these areas, one needs measurements that capture {{a large proportion of}} data that are within a meaningful boundary from <b>target</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Target</b> <b>values</b> can be considered random (measured with error) or � xed (known), depending on the situation.

This article reviews the literature and presents methodologies in terms of “coverage probability. ” In addition, analytical expressions are introduced for all of the aforementioned measurements when the <b>target</b> <b>values</b> are � xed and when the error structure is homogenous or heterogeneous (proportional to <b>target</b> <b>values).</b> This article compares the asymptotic power of accepting the agreement across all competing methods and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} each.

Whilst the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 120µg/m3 limit (i.e. mean ozone concentration not to be exceeded on {{any day of the}} year), there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long-term objective.|$|E
25|$|For example, the ACR {{criteria}} for {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} defines the diagnosis as presence of at least 4 out of 11 findings, each {{of which can be}} regarded as a <b>target</b> <b>value</b> of a test with its own sensitivity and specificity. In this case, there has been evaluation of the tests for these target parameters when used in combination in regard to, for example, interference between them and overlap of target parameters, thereby striving to avoid inaccuracies that could otherwise arise if attempting to calculate the probability of the disease using likelihood ratios of the individual tests. Therefore, if diagnostic criteria have been established for a condition, it is generally most appropriate to interpret any post-test probability for that condition in the context of these criteria.|$|E

25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and thermal drift of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E
500|$|Exponential search extends {{binary search}} to {{unbounded}} lists.

A search takes [...] iterations of the exponential search and at most [...] iterations of the binary search, where [...] is {{the position of the}} <b>target</b> <b>value.</b> Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the <b>target</b> <b>value</b> lies near the beginning of the array.|$|E
