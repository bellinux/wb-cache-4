50|$|Loop {{signaling}} {{was offered}} {{in two different}} configurations for Western Union Telex in the United States. The first option, sometimes called local or loop service, provided a 60 milliampere loop circuit from the exchange to the customer teleprinter. The second option, sometimes called long distance or polar was used when a 60 milliampere connection could not be achieved, provided a ground return polar circuit using 35 milliamperes on separate send and receive wires. By the 1970s, and {{under pressure from the}} Bell operating companies wanting to modernize their cable plant and lower the adjacent circuit noise that these telex circuits sometimes caused, Western Union migrated customers to a third option called F1F2. This F1F2 option replaced the DC voltage of the local and long distance options with modems at the exchange and subscriber ends of the <b>telex</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the {{frontier}} with Spain was re-opened, telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>circuits</b> cut by General Franco were re-established. Subsequently, fibre links into the FLAG cable system (which had a landing point in Estepona, about 50 km from Gibraltar) were established {{and along with}} microwave links to Morocco giving Gibraltar a resilient communications infrastructure. Gibtelecom is also {{a partner in the}} EIG cable system, which will have a landing point in Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|One use of <b>telex</b> <b>circuits,</b> in use {{until the}} widescale {{adoption}} of X.400 and Internet email, was {{to facilitate a}} message handling system, allowing local email systems to exchange messages with other email and telex systems via a central routing operation, or switch. One of the largest such switches was operated by Royal Dutch Shell as recently as 1994, permitting the exchange of messages between a number of IBM Officevision, Digital Equipment Corporation ALL-IN-1 and Microsoft Mail systems. In addition to permitting email {{to be sent to}} telex, formal coding conventions adopted in the composition of telex messages enabled automatic routing of telexes to email recipients.|$|R
