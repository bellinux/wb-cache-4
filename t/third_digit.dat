5|$|These {{traits are}} {{probably}} neotenic, which similarly characterizes traits {{found in many}} other aquatic tetrapods. While Tanystropheus is likely also neotenic, it does not approach Dinocephalosaurus in the extremity of this condition. Several other peculiar traits {{are present in the}} feet of Dinocephalosaurus. Unlike Tanystropheus and most other protorosaurs, the fifth metatarsal of Dinocephalosaurus is simple and straight instead of hooked. Tanystropheus merely has a fifth metatarsal which is mildly thickened at the top end, and it additionally possesses a long phalanx on the fifth digit that acts not unlike another metatarsal. On the <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> of the foot, there are four phalanges but none of them appear to be the terminal claw, which suggests that Dinocephalosaurus had a higher-than-average count of at least five phalanges in the <b>third</b> <b>digit.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the second digit of the hand is the largest, even when the <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> is not present.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the <b>third</b> <b>digit.</b> These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E
5000|$|Birds and {{theropod}} dinosaurs (from which birds evolved) {{have three}} digits on their hands. Paradoxically the two digits that are missing are different: the bird hand (embedded in the wing) {{is thought to}} derive from the second, <b>third</b> and fourth <b>digits</b> of the ancestral five-digit hand. In contrast, the theropod dinosaurs {{seem to have the}} first, second and <b>third</b> <b>digits.</b> Recently a Jurassic theropod intermediate fossil Limusaurus has been found in the Junggar Basin in western China that has a complex mix: it has a first digit stub and full second, <b>third</b> and fourth <b>digits</b> but its wrist bones are like those that are associated with the second, <b>third</b> and fourth <b>digits</b> while its finger bones are those of the first, second and <b>third</b> <b>digits.</b> This suggests the evolution of digits in birds resulted from a [...] "shift in digit identity characterized early stages of theropod evolution" ...|$|R

5|$|The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support the massive head. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers, along with an {{additional}} small metacarpal representing the remnant of a <b>third</b> <b>digit.</b> In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance the massive head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E

500|$|Gorgosaurus shared {{its general}} body plan {{with all other}} tyrannosaurids. Its massive head was perched {{on the end of}} an S-shaped neck. In {{contrast}} to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> seen in other theropods. Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe (hallux) which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured [...] long. In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.|$|E
500|$|Its {{fingers are}} slender, padded, mostly lacking webbing, and semi-dexterous with flat, human-like nails. [...] The thumb is both short and widely {{separated}} from the other fingers. [...] Despite being set at a right angle to the palm, the thumb is not opposable since the ball of the joint is fixed in place. [...] As with all strepsirrhines, the hand is ectaxonic (the axis passes through the fourth digit) rather than mesaxonic (the axis passing through the <b>third</b> <b>digit)</b> as seen in monkeys and apes. [...] The fourth digit is the longest, and only slightly longer than the second digit. [...] Likewise, the fifth digit is only slightly longer than the second. [...] The palms are long and leathery, and like other primates, they have dermal ridges to improve grip. [...] The feet are semi-digitigrade and more specialized than the hands. [...] The big toe is opposable and is smaller than the big toe of other lemurs, which are more arboreal. [...] The second toe is short, has a small terminal pad, and has a toilet-claw (sometimes {{referred to as a}} grooming claw) specialized for personal grooming, specifically to rake through fur that is unreachable by the mouth. [...] The toilet-claw is a trait shared among nearly all living strepsirrhine primates. [...] Unlike other lemurs, the ring-tailed lemur's heel is not covered by fur.|$|E
500|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2006 {{indicated}} that Deinonychus forelimbs {{could be used}} not only for grasping, but also for clutching objects towards the chest. If Deinonychus had feathered fingers and wings, the feathers would have limited the range of motion of the forelimbs to some degree. For example, when Deinonychus extended its arm forward, the 'palm' of the hand automatically rotated to an upward-facing position. This would have caused one wing to block the other if both forelimbs were extended at the same time, leading Senter to conclude that clutching objects to the chest would have only been accomplished with one arm at a time. The function of the fingers would also have been limited by feathers; for example, only the <b>third</b> <b>digit</b> of the hand could have been employed in activities such as probing crevices for small prey items, and only in a position perpendicular to the main wing. Alan Gishlick, in a 2001 study of Deinonychus forelimb mechanics, found that even if large wing feathers were present, the grasping ability of the hand {{would not have been}} significantly hindered; rather, grasping would have been accomplished perpendicular to the wing, and objects likely would have been held by both hands simultaneously in a [...] "bear hug" [...] fashion, findings which have been supported by the later forelimb studies by Carpenter and Senter. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 43 hand bones and 52 foot bones referred to Deinonychus were examined for signs of stress fracture; none were found. The second phalanx of the second toe in the specimen YPM 5205 has a healed fracture.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{morphological}} body conformation of Alabio, Bali, Khaki Campbell, Mojosari and Pegagan ducks {{was carried out}} to determine the genetic distance and discriminant variables. This research was held in Research Institute for Animal Production, Ciawi, Bogor using 65 Alabio ducks, 40 Bali ducks, 36 Khaki Campbell ducks, 60 Mojosari ducks and 30 Pegagan ducks. Seven different body parts were measured, they were the length of femur, tibia, tarsometatarsus, the circumference of tarsometatarsus, the length of <b>third</b> <b>digits,</b> wing and maxilla. General Linear Models and simple discriminant analysis were used in this observation (SAS package program). Male and female Pegagan ducks had morphological size bigger than Alabio, Bali, Khaki Campbell and Mojosari ducks. Khaki Campbell ducks were mixed with Bali ducks (47. 22 %) and Pegagan ducks from isolated location in South Sumatera were lightly mixed with Alabio and Bali. Mahalanobis genetic distance showed that Bali and Khaki Campbell ducks, also, Alabio and Mojosari ducks had similarity, with genetic distance of 1. 420 and 1. 548, respectively.
