5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11f's low {{density is}} {{not shared by}} <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c because the solar wind has reduced their atmospheres to a thin layer. <b>The</b> <b>planets</b> accreted such atmospheres because they formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when a protoplanetary disk was still present.|$|E
5000|$|Asteroid capture {{happens when}} an {{asteroid}} [...] "misses" [...] <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> {{when it is}} falling towards it, {{but it is not}} fast enough to escape from <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> orbit.

5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. <b>The</b> <b>planets</b> {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All <b>the</b> <b>planets,</b> and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, Ares. During this period, the motions of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) {{makes no mention of}} <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{piece of music}} {{influenced}} by astrology is the orchestral suite <b>The</b> <b>Planets.</b> Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of <b>The</b> <b>Planets</b> {{is based upon the}} astrological symbolism of <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled Pluto, the Renewer, first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called Horoscope. In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).|$|E
25|$|Although radial {{velocity}} of the star only gives a planet's minimum mass, if <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> spectral lines can be distinguished from the star's spectral lines then the {{radial velocity}} of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> itself can be found, and this gives the inclination of <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> orbit. This enables measurement of <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> actual mass. This also rules out false positives, and also provides data about the composition of <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> <b>The</b> main issue is that such detection is possible only if <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> orbits around a relatively bright star and if <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> reflects or emits a lot of light.|$|R

50|$|Planets {{close to}} their stars on {{circular}} orbits will tend to despin and become tidally locked. As <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> rotation slows down the radius of a synchronous orbit of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> moves outwards from <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> For planets tidally locked to their stars, the distance from <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> at which <b>the</b> moon {{will be in a}} synchronous orbit around <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is outside <b>the</b> Hill sphere of <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> <b>The</b> Hill sphere of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is <b>the</b> region where its gravity dominates that of the star so it can hold on to its moons. Moons inside the synchronous orbit radius of a planet will spiral into <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> Therefore, if <b>the</b> synchronous orbit is outside the Hill sphere, then all moons will spiral into <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> If <b>the</b> synchronous orbit is not three-body stable then moons outside this radius will escape orbit before they reach the synchronous orbit.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>planets</b> {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, {{it was not until}} the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E

5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained {{immersed in a}} disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> in their current orbits.|$|E
50|$|Mercury's {{magnetic}} field {{is strong enough}} to deflect the solar wind around <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> creating a magnetosphere. <b>The</b> <b>planet's</b> magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within Earth, {{is strong enough to}} trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the space weathering of <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> surface. Observations taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> nightside. Bursts of energetic particles in <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> magnetosphere.|$|R

50|$|Although Spitzer {{could not}} resolve <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> into a disk, by {{measuring}} changes as <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> rotated, <b>the</b> team created a simple longitudinal map.

5|$|After {{between three}} and tenmillion years, the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into {{interstellar}} space, thus ending the growth of <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Ephemerides {{with complex}} astrological calculations, and almanacs {{interpreting}} celestial events {{for use in}} medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, <b>the</b> <b>planets,</b> and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another.

5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of <b>The</b> <b>Planets</b> in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from <b>The</b> <b>Planets</b> and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E
50|$|While {{some authors}} choose {{to treat a}} planet in depth, {{considering}} it to have a wide diversity of geography, climate, politics and culture, others prefer to characterize their planets by some single global characteristic.
