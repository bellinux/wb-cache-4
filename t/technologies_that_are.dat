Green Goats are a type of hybrid switching locomotive utilizing a small diesel engine and a large bank of rechargeable batteries. Switching locomotives are of particular concern as they typically operate in a limited area, often in or near urban centers, and {{spend much of their}} time idling.

2500|$|In his 2003 book Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age, {{environmental}} ethicist Bill McKibben argued {{at length}} against {{many of the}} <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> postulated or supported by transhumanists, including germinal choice technology, nanomedicine and life extension strategies. He claims {{that it would be}} morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to [...] "improve" [...] themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish.|$|E
