5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, {{as a matter of}} law, a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent that}} it infringes on their § 7 right <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt}} to sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Circuit {{held that}} this {{interpretation}} of Section 7 was impermissible {{and refused to}} enforce the NLRB order. The Fifth Circuit followed {{the lead of the}} Seventh and Fourth circuits which had refused to enforce the NLRB's previous decisions in Mobil Oil Corp. and Quality Mfg. Co. respectively. The Fifth Circuit argued that no union presence was necessary in Collins' questioning because the company was not attempting <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> with her in any way. Additionally, the court argued that requiring a union representative any time the threat of discipline was present would extend the scope of the NLRA far too broadly. The NLRB appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a two-sided {{incomplete}} information bargaining model {{between a}} seller and a buyer. The buyer has an outside option, which is modeled as a sequential search process {{during which he}} can also choose <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>bargaining</b> at any time. Two cases considered: In Regime I, both agents have symmetric information about the search parameters. We find that, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>bargaining</b> with complete information, the option <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>bargaining</b> is not redundant in equilibrium. However, the no-delay result still holds. In Regime II, where agents have asymmetric information about the outside option, delay is possible. The solution characterizes the parameters for renegotiation and those for search with no return <b>to</b> the <b>bargaining</b> table.

5|$|In Mexico, Marston {{sides with}} Mexican Army Colonel Agustín Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) and his {{right-hand}} man Captain Vincente de Santa (Hector Luis Bustamante), to help end a rebellion {{in return for}} Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays Marston, who then sides with the rebels. With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts (Ross Hagen), Marston, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes (Josh Segarra) {{and one of his}} lovers Luisa (Francesca Galeas), eventually turns the tide in favour of the rebels, killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. Marston is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. Marston and Reyes then take the fight to Allende, where Luisa is killed during the attack. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee, but are apprehended and executed. Reyes then takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while Marston leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.|$|E
5|$|Julien: Julien {{dreams of}} Marie, {{whom he met}} {{just over a year}} before at a party, and with whom he would have begun a {{relationship}} but for them both having partners. He immediately runs into her on the street as she is running for her bus and he is off to meet Madame X. They agree to meet again, but Marie fails to appear and he returns home to find Madame X waiting for him against their agreement, so he raises his price tenfold. Madame X returns the next day to try <b>to</b> <b>bargain,</b> and asks for a letter back that he does not have. Marie invites him to her place for dinner, where Julien tells her his girlfriend ran away with another man and Marie says her boyfriend Simon died six months ago. They have sex, but in the morning Marie has checked out of her apartment. Julien returns home to find that his house has been ransacked. He tries to find her by ringing her old boss, then tracks her down when an unknown woman calls to tell him the hotel Marie is staying at. Julien visits her there, and Marie agrees to move in with him.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E

5|$|The players went {{on strike}} on July 13, 1970 after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners {{threatened}} to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care {{was added to the}} players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.|$|E
5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E
5|$|He had eleven known children, all by Elizabeth. His eldest son, and heir, John, Earl of Lincoln (c. 1462–16 June 1487), eventually, due to King Richard III {{losing his}} own son, became heir to his {{maternal}} uncle's throne. Following Richard's death at Bosworth Field, Lincoln rebelled {{against the new}} king Henry VII, and himself was killed at the Battle of Stoke. John de la Pole's second son, Geoffrey, was born circa 1464, but died young. Next, Edward (1466–1485) joined the church and became Archdeacon of Richmond. John de la Pole's first daughter, Elizabeth (c. 1468–1489), married Henry Lovel, 8th Baron Morley (1466–1489), and had no issue. John's dukedom descended to his fourth son, Edmund (1471–30 April 1513), who had <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> energetically with the king and pay a substantial amount before it was granted. He eventually became a Yorkist pretender to Henry VIII's crown, who had him beheaded. Another daughter, Dorothy, {{who was born in}} 1472, died young, whilst next, Humphrey (1474–1513) took Holy Orders, while Anne (1476–1495) became a nun. John's final daughter, Katherine (c. 1477–1513), made a good marriage to William, Baron Stourton, with whom she had no issue. John de la Pole's two youngest sons both seem to have been involved in a plot against Henry VII that was discovered in 1501. Sir William de la Pole, of Wingfield Castle (1478–1539) was imprisoned in the Tower of London, for thirty-seven years. Before this he had married Katherine Stourton; she was twenty years older than him, and they had no issue. The youngest son, Richard de la Pole (1480–1525), managed to escape to France on the discovery of the 1501 plot. Taking part in France's campaigns during the Italian Wars, he was killed at the Battle of Pavia, 24 February 1525.|$|E

Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying <b>to</b> <b>bargain</b> down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to the annoyance of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E
