500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that,</b> {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
