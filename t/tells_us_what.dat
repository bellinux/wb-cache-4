It <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> a thing is, that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E
2500|$|Latin {{names of}} {{structures}} such as musculus biceps brachii can be split up and refer to, musculus for muscle, biceps for [...] "two-headed", brachii as in the brachial region of the arm. The first word <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we are speaking about, the second describes it, and the third points to location.|$|E
2500|$|Expression {{profiling}} is {{a logical}} next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the cell could possibly do, while the expression profile <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> it is actually doing {{at a point in}} time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from {{only a fraction of the}} genes it carries. [...] If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered [...] "on", otherwise [...] "off". [...] Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. [...] Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.|$|E

2500|$|In the October 2010 {{issue of}} The Orange Standard, Grand Master Robert Saulters {{referred}} to 'dissident' Irish republican paramilitaries as the [...] "Roman Catholic IRA". SDLP MLA John Dallat asked Justice Minister David Ford to find if Saulters {{had broken the}} hate speech laws. He said: [...] "Linking the Catholic community or indeed any community to terror groups is inciting weak-minded people to hatred, and surely history <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> {{that has led to}} in the past". In a 2011 survey of 1,500 Orangemen throughout Northern Ireland, over 60% believed that [...] "most Catholics are IRA sympathisers".|$|E
2500|$|Details of {{what had}} {{happened}} with the poll were picked up by various media; as one writer explained, [...] "Voting for Hank offered people a chance to violate People's expectations while still playing by its rules”. [...] Some observers concluded that the reaction by the public to vote for Hank was a veiled commentary on how the media assumes that the masses are easily manipulated into liking what is marketed to them. The New York Times quoted a participant in the poll as stating, [...] "The 'media' <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> food to eat, what movies to see, what music to listen to, who to vote for politically and what kind of people are attractive enough to have relationships with!...Voting for 'Hank the Dwarf' is a reflection of how the people really feel about media!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen {{continued}} the positivist tradition {{in his book}} the Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with [...] "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive [...] "is" [...] statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway is €500); law <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we [...] "should" [...] do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (Grundnorm) instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, Carl Schmitt, rejected both positivism and the idea {{of the rule of law}} because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions. Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception (state of emergency), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{account is}} in full {{agreement}} with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. In Metaphysics he writes: [...] "Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [...] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle is the Great and Small , and the essence is the One (τὸ ἕν), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One" [...] (987 b). [...] "From this account {{it is clear that}} he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms - that it is this the duality (the Dyad, ἡ δυάς), the Great and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil" [...] (988 a).|$|E
2500|$|Kardashian {{appeared}} on the cover, and in a pictorial in Papers winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude. On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: [...] "Break the Internet", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media. The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera. A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> {{it is like to}} live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise." [...] However, the stunt [...] "set a new benchmark" [...] in social media response, and Papers website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.|$|E
