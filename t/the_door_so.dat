Urinals in the street may be arranged in a circle, with all users facing the center, with partitions high enough that they cannot wet each other, and usually high enough that they cannot see over. In a street urinal with an outside screen or wall, the users may stand back to back.|$|E
25|$|This {{left the}} receiver, time base {{system and the}} display inside the {{aircraft}} cabin. There was ample room for this in the Beaufighter where the radar operator sat {{at the back of}} the fuselage. In the Mosquito, the radar operator sat to the right and slightly behind the pilot. The main entry door was located on the left side of the fuselage, just in front of the radar operator. With the radar installed, this left almost no room to reach <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> the time base circuitry was mounted on rails that allowed it to be slid up and forward, out of the way of the door. Among the parts inside the aircraft were the Type 73 display and the TR.3152 Lucero.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the procession, the Epitaphios {{is brought}} back to the church. Sometimes, after the clergy carry the Epitaphios in, they will stop just inside the {{entrance}} to the church, and hold the Epitaphios above <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> that all who enter the church will pass under it (symbolically entering into the grave with Christ) and then kiss the Gospel Book. In Greek churches, the Epitaphios is then brought directly to the sanctuary, where it remains on the Holy Table until Ascension Thursday. In Slavic churches, it is brought back to the catafalque {{in the middle of the}} church (and may be honoured further with more petals, rosewater and incense), where it remains until the Midnight Office at the Paschal Vigil on Great Saturday night. Where the Epitaphios remains in the centre of the church, the faithful will continue to venerate it throughout Great Saturday.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to {{come back into the}} house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>so</b> they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are simple, written as an {{invitation}} to dance with the singer. Despite the simple lyrics, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. Similar to Madonna's previous single [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984), a lyrical hook is also present in [...] "Into the Groove", directed at shy girls. The line [...] "At night I lock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>so</b> no-one else can see" [...] implied that Madonna was not as brazen as her provocative image suggested. According to Barker, the nostalgic people would instantly recognize the song's lyrics at night clubs. He added that the line, [...] "Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free," [...] expresses the freedom that a dance floor brings about, with the dancers happy to find freedom in the music. A neume is visible in the line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me", which Barker believed, blurred the boundaries of reality and brought one closer {{to the world of}} fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{however, the}} {{audience}} {{had been growing}} more and more numerous every moment; there was hardly standing-room round {{the top of the}} companion; and the strange instinct of the race moved some of the new-comers to close both <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> that <b>the</b> atmosphere grew insupportable. It was a good place, as the saying is, to leave.|$|R
60|$|Charlie {{spoke on}} and on, and on; while I, {{separated}} from him {{by thousands of}} years, was considering the beginnings of things.

2500|$|..... completes what, perhaps, may {{be termed}} a trilogy; for, though very {{different}} in scope, {{each of the three}} books deals with certain conceptions that have an elemental kinship.

2500|$|The actress Lucy Speed – {{seventeen}} at {{the time}} – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, {{they thought it was}} the quality they were looking for…Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until I walked through <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>So</b> I got the part.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Nale Ba was {{an urban}} legend viral during the 1990s in Karnataka. The myth goes [...] "a witch roams {{the streets in}} the night and knocks <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> witch {{apparently}} spoke in voices of your kin so you would be deceived to open <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> If you open it then you will die." [...] To avoid her, people used to write Nale Ba ( [...] come tomorrow [...] ) on <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>So</b> <b>the</b> ghost reads it and goes back to come again the next day and the cycle repeats.|$|R

2500|$|A {{safety door}} {{prevents}} finger injuries near the hinges {{without the use}} of door guards. [...] Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>so</b> that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. [...] This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular ("bull-nose" [...] shaped) extension to the door, which moves {{in and out of a}} cavity as the door opens and closes. [...] This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges – either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a doorstop).|$|E

50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> slide {{vertically}} downwards into the body, the top {{halves of the}} sides of the car slide into the bottom half. The high sills can make entry and exit harder, although they do offer crash protection independent of <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> vehicle may be legally and safely driven with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> up or down. BMW never imported the Z1 to the U.S. They are legal in the U.S., but only when the car is imported under the NHTSA's Show & Display exemption for technologically and historically significant vehicles.|$|R
