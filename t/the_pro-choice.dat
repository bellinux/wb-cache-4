500|$|Of the 363,778 {{registered}} Democrats in the state, 172,812, or 47.5%, {{voted in}} the primary; 166,744 of them cast ballots in the gubernatorial race.

500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy.

[...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church".
