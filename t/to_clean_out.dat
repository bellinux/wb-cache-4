5|$|Initially, Cosme was {{predicted}} {{to make landfall}} on Hawaii as a tropical storm. In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers. County crews worked <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> drains and culverts to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> {{an old and}} dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{symptoms}} of external otitis lead many people to attempt <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, self-cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs.|$|E

Since 1990, creosote buildup has caused 75% fewer fires. This is partly due to the use of efficient wood-burning stoves that fully combust the carbon from fuel, and partly due to the use of Class A flues, insulated double wall stainless steel pipe.|$|E

Since early 2011, RZA has been producing UK artist Josh Osho's debut album.|$|E
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E
25|$|In September, Arenas {{underwent}} a third operation on his surgically repaired left knee <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> fluid and debris, and {{was expected to}} miss {{at least the first}} month of the season. The forecast came in longer than expected, as Arenas missed 5 months of action due to concerns on his knee before returning on March 29, 2009. In {{the first game of the}} preseason, Jamison suffered a right knee contusion, and was expected to miss the rest of the preseason. Haywood announced that he would undergo surgery on his right wrist and was expected to miss 4–6 months. The preseason marked the return of Etan Thomas who had missed all of the 2007–2008 season while recovering from open heart surgery. The Wizards added guard Fenny Falmagne from the Dakota Wizards on August 23, 2008 that later was waived by the team after knee injury.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the site.|$|E
25|$|The queen {{serves as}} the primary egg layer of the nest and begins the nest {{construction}} {{at the beginning of}} a season. If she adopt an already existing nest, it is her duty <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the nest and prepare it for egg laying. The queen is the top of the caste system and dominates in any dominance interaction with a subordinate. These interactions are fairly common for the queen. Queens tend to forage mainly for pulp, but they have sometimes been observed foraging for insects as well. While queens rarely forage for nectar, co-foundresses and workers do so frequently. Workers are also in charge of distributing food to other adults and larvae when they return from foraging. Workers are key in building cells and raising their walls. Non-workers, on the other hand, rarely forage themselves and depend on the collections of food that foragers bring back to the nest; this behavior defines non-workers. This caste has also been observed to leave the nest for extended periods of time to either mate or forage for themselves. They do, however, contribute to defense of the nest. There have also been examples of non-workers breaking down cell walls after larvae have matured, so it seems like the distinction between worker and non-worker is less clear than was previously thought. Finally, males aid in keeping the nest cool in hot temperatures by fanning their wings and they rely heavily on the food that foragers bring back to the nest. They sometimes swarm the foragers in order to get the nectar, pulp, and insects that the foragers bring.|$|E
500|$|It {{was thought}} that the failure had been caused by there being too much {{remaining}} superstructure, and attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> the large quantity of oil that had spilled out during the attempt to raise her. [...] The {{decision was made to}} burn off the oil, but the fire spread and had to be brought back under control. She was again patched up and pumped with air, breaking the surface on 29 November. The Bremse was eventually considered too unsafe to tow to Rosyth for scrapping, as had been done with the other ships Cox had salvaged, and instead she was taken to Lyness on 30 November 1929 and broken up there.|$|E

He had earlier told Dwyer of his plan <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> his backyard, and was told to rest, but did so anyway, falling down and rolling off the steep slope in his backyard and over the ledge of the cliff abutting the rear of his house. There was innuendo that McCabe had actually committed suicide, with O'Reilly musing [...] "He had despatched the possum, but had gone overboard with it!". However, the coroner ruled that the death was accidental and his family strongly denied that he had chosen to end his life. The coroner’s investigation noted that McCabe’s hands had tufts of ripped grass in them, indicating that he had tried to grab onto vegetation in a vain attempt to stop his fall.|$|E
500|$|Dolan {{gave him}} a {{contract}} for the 2000–01 season and appointed him as York's captain despite the concerns over his knee. Swan battled against his own body to play all the pre-season friendlies, including a clash with Manchester United and their star players of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, and Paul Scholes. He was sent off {{in the first game}} of the season after attempting to headbutt Chesterfield's Steve Blatherwick. He captained the [...] "Minstermen" [...] for the first and only time at Bootham Crescent against Cheltenham Town, before he went in for some keyhole surgery <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> his knee. The surgeon told Swan that [...] "the mess in there is unbelievable... there's no cartilage, there are bits floating around everywhere and it's riddled with arthritis" [...] and warned him that any further matches could see him confined to a wheelchair. After a few weeks Swan accepted both Dolan's and the surgeon's advice and retired.|$|E
