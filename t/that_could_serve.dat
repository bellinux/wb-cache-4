5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy {{to design a}} ship <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> in both colonial and fleet scout roles. During the design process, it was determined a three-shaft arrangement of the machinery {{would be necessary to}} attain the high speed requirement. This resulted in the first warship of the German Navy to use three screws. This was a relatively novel development; at the time of Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E

In May 1941, the Massachusetts Legislature authorized {{the purchase of}} a large tract of farmland spanning the borders of the towns of Bedford, Lincoln, Concord and Lexington for a Boston Auxiliary Airport. Funds to build the new airport were contributed by the federal government, which had appropriated $40 million to build 250 new civil airports across the United States <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> for future national defense.|$|E

In the wake of a famous battle, especially one that marked the culmination of a war such as Ulundi on 4 July 1879, every European involved in the battle appeared to want to own an object <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a reminder of the event.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} {{extensions}} started October 14, 1971 with Line 1 (Green) {{towards the}} east to reach {{the site where the}} Olympic Stadium was to be built and Autoroute 25 (Honoré-Beaugrand station) <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a transfer point for visitors arriving from outside. The extensions were an opportunity to make improvements to the network, such as new trains, larger stations and even semi-automatic control. The first extension was completed in June 1976 just before the Olympics. Line 1 was later extended to the southwest to reach the suburbs of Verdun and LaSalle with the Angrignon as the terminus station, named after the zoo. This station opened in September 1978.|$|E

In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered {{with a combination of}} Boeing 777-200ER and 757-200 equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin. Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, {{this shift}} {{mirrored}} the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ("music for use"), as composers sought to create music <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> a utilitarian {{as well as}} artistic purpose. This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc. Toward this end, Copland provided musical advice and inspiration to The Group Theatre, a company which also attracted Stella Adler, Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. Philosophically an outgrowth of Stieglitz and his ideals, the Group focused on socially-relevant plays by the American authors. Through it and later his work in film, Copland met several major American playwrights, including Thornton Wilder, William Inge, Arthur Miller, and Edward Albee, and considered projects with all of them.|$|E
25|$|After {{some initial}} studies with {{composer}} Rubin Goldmark, Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with Isidor Philipp and Paul Vidal, then with noted pedagogue Nadia Boulanger. He studied {{three years with}} Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon {{his return to the}} U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing. He found composing orchestral music in the modernist style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach, particularly in light of the Great Depression. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ("music for use"), music <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer Carlos Chávez and began composing his signature works.|$|E

25|$|Ridgway's first {{concern was}} to occupy ground <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> {{as a base}} both for {{continuing}} the advance toward the complex and, {{in view of the}} enemy's evident offensive preparations, for developing a defensive position. The base selected, line Kansas, traced the lower bank of the Imjin in the west. From the Imjin eastward as far as the Hwach'on Reservoir the line lay two to six miles (3–10km) above the 38th parallel across the approaches to the Iron Triangle. Following the lower shoreline of the reservoir, it then turned slightly north to a depth of ten miles (16km) above the parallel before falling off southeastward to the Yangyang area on the coast. In the advance to line Kansas, designated Operation Rugged, the I and IX Corps were to seize the segment of the line between the Imjin and {{the western edge of the}} Hwach'on Reservoir. To the east, the X Corps was to occupy the portion tracing the reservoir shore and reaching Route 24 in the Soyang River valley, and the ROK III and I Corps were to take the section between Route 24 and Yangyang.|$|E

The resulting design was unsatisfactory, since the requirements for the roles were contradictory. For example, powerful engines necessary for the high top speeds needed in a fleet scout were also very coal hungry, which reduced the ship's endurance; a long cruising radius was mandatory for ships intended to police Germany's far-flung colonial empire, however.|$|E

500|$|After several {{visits to}} the Auca village, which the missionaries called [...] "Terminal City", they {{observed}} that the Huaorani seemed excited to receive their gifts. Encouraged, they began using a loudspeaker to shout simple Huaorani phrases as they circled. After several more drops, in November the Huaorani began tying gifts for the missionaries to the line after removing the gifts the missionaries gave them. The men took this {{as a gesture of}} friendliness and developed plans for meeting the Huaorani on the ground. Saint soon identified a 200-yard (200m) sandbar along the Curaray River about 4.5miles (7km) from Terminal City <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a runway and camp site, and dubbed it [...] "Palm Beach".|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} {{what became the}} Tucker class {{was the result of}} compromises between the General Board of the United States Navy and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair. The General Board, tasked with {{creating}} an integrated battle fleet, wanted a larger ship <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> in a scouting role and proposed a ship larger than the unique British destroyer [...] of 1907, and more than twice the displacement of any previous U.S. destroyer.
