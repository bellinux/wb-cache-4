25|$|Two other Marine groups became {{isolated}} in the fighting along the perimeter. One platoon from 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment—scouting the Japanese flank position—slipped through the jungle and passed by the enemy force without being observed. Choosing {{to head for the}} beach instead of the interior, the platoon struggled to the coast. There, the patrol cleaned its weapons with gasoline from a wrecked barge, and spent the night in the jungle. The next morning, the attention of an Allied plane was attracted and within an hour the platoon was picked up by a <b>tank</b> <b>lighter</b> and returned to the main lines. The other isolated unit—a patrol from Company B—was cut {{off from the rest of}} the battalion during the fighting and spent the night of 7–8 November behind Japanese lines without detection.|$|E

50|$|The Goettge Patrol left at dusk on a <b>tank</b> <b>lighter.</b> However, a flare {{was seen}} {{to the east and}} the lighter {{returned}} to the perimeter, thinking it was a signal to return. The patrol then left for a second time around 9:00 p.m. Despite Whaling's warning, the boat headed for an area just {{to the west of the}} Matanikau river mouth. Before the patrol reached the beach, the lighter ran aground on a sandbar. The coxswain gunned the motor to free the vessel, and the Marines disembarked on the beach around 10:00 p.m.|$|E

50|$|On the {{following}} day, despite the obstacles imposed by rudimentary receiving facilities on shore and an extreme shortage of lighters, Terror unloaded her cargo of depth charges and ammunition, using a salvaged <b>tank</b> <b>lighter</b> and several wooden barges. Having accomplished her mission, Terror departed Casablanca and rendezvoused with a convoy {{bound for the}} east coast of the United States. Strong head winds, heavy seas, and the slowness of the convoy made it difficult for Terror to keep her station. Off the Virginia Capes, Terror was detached from the convoy and made for the Naval Mine Depot, Yorktown. She arrived on 30 November to commence overhaul and training.|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1930, the United States Marine Corps was {{interested}} in landing tankettes on beaches along with assaulting infantry. By the mid-1930s, Marine planners had settled on a beach assault procedure that involved a purpose built craft for the initial assault wave, ships' boats and cutters for follow-on troops, and a purpose built <b>tank</b> <b>lighter</b> for vehicles, guns, and supplies. [...] Nevertheless, progress was difficult and slow {{due to lack of}} funding. Also, the Navy placed restrictions on such craft - considering transportation and deployment of them from available ships. By 1940, prototypes, of 38-foot to 40-foot long vessels, had been built and tested. The positive attributes of these were recognized and, by September 1940, the USMC had made known their requirements for a tank landing craft. The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair produced a 45-foot lighter capable of carrying the 15 ton Army model tank the Marines anticipated using. What evolved became the LCM (2), although {{at the time it was}} referred to using the Marine Corps designation of YL.|$|E

5000|$|Placed in full {{commission}} on 17 May 1937 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Antares was assigned temporary duty with the Naval Transportation Service (a forerunner {{of the later}} Military Sea Transportation Service and the Military Sealift Command), and operated on both east and west coasts. She also operated with the Training Detachment, United States Fleet, and while assigned to this unit participated in Fleet Landing Exercise No. 4 in February 1938. In his report of the evolution, Rear Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson—Commander, Training Detachment—considered that Antares—which had acted as a [...] "utility auxiliary"—had proved [...] "indispensable". He commended her performance of duty, which had been performed {{in spite of a}} [...] "crammed schedule, allowing little or no time for upkeep." [...] Antares was the only ship available which could handle the experimental <b>tank</b> <b>lighter,</b> artillery lighter, and other heavy marine equipment. [...] "Her design," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "except for speed, is ideal for the type of duty performed, and without her services serious curtailment of the operations would have been necessary." ...|$|E
40|$|If two {{liquefied}} {{natural gases}} (LNG) obtained {{from two different}} sources are inappropriately fed into a storage <b>tank,</b> <b>lighter</b> LNG may lie over heavier LNG forming a stratification, which could eventually lead to a rollover. Few models available in the literature predict time to rollover in LNG storage tanks. These are semi-empirical in nature as they are based upon empirical correlations to estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients across the stratified layers. We present a lumped parameter model in order to predict time to rollover and to investigate its sensitivity to variation of heat and mass transfer coefficients. The novelty of the present work {{is its ability to}} estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients from the real time data using an inverse methodology. We assimilate the real time LNG level-temperature-density (LTD) data from LNG storage tank in order to estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients from the densities of the stratified layers. The optimized heat and mass transfer coefficients are then used to predict time to rollover. We present a sequence of LTD profiles obtained from real time LNG terminal and which are leading to rollover in one case study (Section 4. 1). The time to rollover predicted using this inverse methodology is compared with the LTD profiles obtained from real LNG tank and also with time to rollover obtained using empirical correlations. Heat transfer coefficients estimated using empirical correlations are found to be over-estimated for some case studies, which under predict time to rollover. For the real time case study, time to rollover predicted using empirical correlations is under predicted by about 84 %, where as that using the inverse methodology is under predicted by about 20 %.
