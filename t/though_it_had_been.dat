Portland distillery Integrity Spirits responded by releasing the second American-made absinthe, which was in high demand immediately upon its release.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} readily available until 1957, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 30, 1910.

The film was also shown by the Province Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> released years prior to its examination by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures, the film was approved without need any modifications or censoring.|$|E

5|$|The Caton–Corning {{segment of}} the route was {{acquired}} {{by the state of}} New York in 1911 and designated as part of NY44 (now NY414) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It received its current designation in 1949 when NY414 was truncated to begin in Corning. The highway leading east from Caton to Big Flats was county-maintained from the 1930s through the 1970s, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> part of NY13 from the 1930 renumbering to the 1940s. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the highway by 1986, and the new state highway became an extension of NY225.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps F-4B-18-MC Phantom II, Bureau Number (BuNo) 151458, coded '458', {{had been}} in {{operation}} since April 15, 1964. At {{the time of the}} accident it was assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, Marine Aircraft Group 11, 3rd Marine Air Wing, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> operated by various squadrons prior to that. The fighter plane was piloted by 1st Lt. James R. Phillips, age 27. The Radar Intercept Officer was 1st Lt. Christopher E. Schiess, age 24. The jet and its crew were based at MCAS El Toro.|$|E
5|$|When AirTrain JFK {{was being}} planned, it was {{expected}} that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, while 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paid passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. The system would cause a reduction of approximately 75,000 vehicle miles driven per day, as well as accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, according to the FEIS. During the first month of service, an average of 15,000 daily passengers rode either the paid or unpaid sections of the system, less than the 34,000 expected daily riders. This made it the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> open for only a month. Since then, ridership continued to rise. AirTrain JFK transported 1 million riders within its first six months.|$|E

5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E
5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Greek Cypriot defensive line, the GEEF ordered the 226th battalion to mount a defensive line together with the 341st reserve battalion in order to delay the Turkish forces. The 226th battalion retreated at 21:00 to the south, while the 341st stayed put. The Turkish Air Force started hitting the retreating Greek forces and the Greek-Cypriot artillery battalions started retreating to the east as well. The 9th Tactical Group, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> not attacked, faced the danger of encirclement from the south, and so started its retreat by 12:00. At 14:30 it had reached Famagusta.|$|E
