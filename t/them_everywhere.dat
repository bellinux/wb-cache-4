25|$|The band {{realized}} that they couldn't promote themselves very easily without having to bring their instruments with <b>them</b> <b>everywhere</b> they went, so they started performing a cappella versions of their music. This method was successful as their first show at the House of Blues in Orlando, FL was completely sold out.|$|E
25|$|One Franquin {{creation}} {{that went}} on to develop {{a life of its}} own was the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail. The Marsupilami appears in the majority of the Franquin stories, starting in 1952 with Spirou et les héritiers. In the series, it is adopted by the duo and follows <b>them</b> <b>everywhere</b> they go. Marsupilamis in the wild take centre stage briefly in Le nid des Marsupilamis (1957) which presents Seccotine's documentary featuring a family in their natural habitat, the jungles of the fictitious South American state Palombia.|$|E
25|$|During the pontificate of Pius IX {{a strong}} Ultramontane {{movement}} arose against the French Breviaries of 1680 and 1736. This was inaugurated by Montalembert, but its literary advocates were chiefly Dom Gueranger, a learned Benedictine monk, abbot of Solesmes, and Louis Veuillot (1813–1883) of the Univers; and it succeeded in suppressing <b>them</b> <b>everywhere,</b> the last diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where Breviaries {{based on the}} French models were published at Cologne, Münster, Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, {{under the direction of}} Benedict XIV (pope 1740–1758), a special congregation collected much material for an official revision, but nothing was published. In 1902, under Leo XIII, a commission under the presidency of Monsignor Louis Duchesne was appointed to consider the Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.|$|E

500|$|Warbrick said of {{his time}} in the British Isles: [...] "My {{impression}} of England and its people during the tour was a very favourable one, more especially does this apply to private individuals. I found <b>them</b> <b>everywhere</b> very kind and attentive and apparently anxious to make one's visit as pleasant as possible". The term [...] "private individuals" [...] may have been used to exclude from praise both the RFU and London press. Following the tour he also criticised the partiality of the English referees, and believed that the English administrators displayed a double standard in their treatment of the Natives; the RFU treated the Native team's motives for touring with suspicion, believing the enterprise to be speculative and criticising them for not upholding the amateur principles the RFU liked to espouse. Yet the RFU continued to select Andrew Stoddart for England, despite him touring with the speculative and unsanctioned 1888 British team that travelled to New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees <b>them</b> <b>everywhere.</b> That really {{has a lot to do}} with the success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

2500|$|A person's {{personal}} space is carried with <b>them</b> <b>everywhere</b> they go. It {{is the most}} inviolate form of territory. Body spacing and posture, according to Hall, are unintentional reactions to sensory fluctuations or shifts, such as subtle changes in the sound and pitch of a person's voice. Social distance between people is reliably correlated with physical distance, as are intimate and personal distance, according to the delineations below. [...] Hall did not mean for these measurements to be strict guidelines that translate precisely to human behavior, but rather a system for gauging the effect of distance on communication and how the effect varies between cultures and other environmental factors.|$|E
2500|$|They met in 1924, and {{her father}} opposed the match from the start. He {{went so far as}} to send her off to Europe to find other suitors and forget Mr. Berlin. However, Berlin wooed her with letters and song over the airwaves such as [...] "Remember" [...] and [...] "All Alone," [...] and she wrote him daily. Biographer Philip Furia writes that {{newspapers}} rumored they were engaged before she returned from Europe, and some Broadway shows even performed skits of the [...] "lovelorn songwriter." [...] After her return, she and Berlin were besieged by the press, which followed <b>them</b> <b>everywhere.</b> Variety reported that her father vowed that their marriage [...] "would only happen 'over my dead body.'" [...] As a result, they decided to elope and were married in a simple civil ceremony at the Municipal Building away from media attention.|$|E
2500|$|The Spice Girls became media icons in Great Britain and {{a regular}} feature of the British press. During the peak of their {{worldwide}} fame in 1997, the paparazzi were constantly seen following <b>them</b> <b>everywhere</b> to obtain stories and gossip about the group, as a supposed affair between Emma Bunton and manager Simon Fuller, or constant split rumours which became fodder for numerous tabloids. Rumours of in-fighting and conflicts within the group also made headlines, with the rumours suggesting that Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown in particular were fighting {{to be the leader}} of the group. Brown, who later admitted that she used to be a [...] "bitch" [...] to Halliwell, said the problems had stayed in the past. The rumours reached their height when the Spice Girls dismissed their manager Simon Fuller during the power struggles, with Fuller reportedly receiving a £10 million severance cheque to keep quiet about the details of his sacking. Months later, in May 1998, Halliwell would leave the band amid rumours of a falling out with Brown; the news of Halliwell's departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year.|$|E
