5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>the</b> Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>the</b> British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E

5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
