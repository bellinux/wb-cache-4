5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes. Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, and was able <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of his supporters that Abu'l-Abbas could lay his hands on.|$|E
5|$|As the Batavian force {{prepared}} to sail, on 16 August Elphinstone's fleet appeared off the bay, {{led by the}} scouting frigate Crescent. He {{sent a letter to}} Lucas demanding his surrender but this was refused. Ascertaining the strength of the Batavian force, on 17 August Elphinstone led his fleet into the bay in line of battle and brought the line to anchor at close gunshot range from Lucas's ships. Trapped between the coast and the British, Lucas immediately raised a flag of truce. He then sent an officer to negotiate terms with Elphinstone. By 17:00, hopelessly outnumbered and his crews in open rebellion, Lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost unconditional surrender of the Batavian force. Elphinstone furthermore refused Lucas's request for cartels <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> send his crews back to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|As {{the taping}} time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} {{that he has}} not been taking his medication correctly. Liz calls Tracy's doctor, Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), who gives her instructions regarding the medication. Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech he is going to read at The Waldorf Astoria.

Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|At age {{fourteen}} he met Symeon the Studite (also called Symeon the Pious), a holy monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople. That meeting {{convinced the}} younger Symeon to forgo {{higher education and}} take on Symeon the Studite as his spiritual father. At that time he began studying the life of prayer and asceticism under his guidance, with the desire <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> enter the monastery. Symeon the Studite asked the young Symeon to wait before becoming a monk, so he spent the years until age twenty-seven serving in the household of a patrician, though according to some sources he served the emperor instead.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Arsaces {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in Parthia and Hyrcania {{by taking advantage of}} the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r.246–222BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246–241BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of Seleucus II Callinicus (r.246–225BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r.222–187BC), was unable <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of Molon in Media.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings and the ability <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of {{the two sides are}} essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 May, Dönitz gave the order for all German {{military}} forces to unconditionally surrender, and on 8 May the German Instrument of Surrender was delivered to General Böhme. The Germans were to withdraw from all Norwegian towns and the Swedish border and gradually redeploy to areas pre-designated for disarmament; simultaneously, all senior Nazi party officials and security personnel were <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> be arrested. Force 134 would be greatly outnumbered during its task; a total of 30,000 Allied troops would have to supervise the disarmament of more than 350,000 German troops. There were fears that the German forces might refuse to surrender and instead resist the Allied occupation forces, and there were particular concerns about what the large detachment of Kriegsmarine personnel at the port of Trondheim might do.|$|E
5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Eiffel Tower {{is often}} used in popular culture <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower {{is often used}} in the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also {{frequently}} used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E
5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner.

When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began <b>to</b> <b>immediately</b> pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
