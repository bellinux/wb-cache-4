5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands, was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

5|$|Mummification on <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands {{during the}} Guanche period {{remained}} confined to Tenerife, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, and El Hierro. The most well-preserved, {{and therefore the}} most thoroughly-studied, mummies were found on Tenerife.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Atlantic <b>canary</b> was {{classified}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in his Systema Naturae. Linnaeus originally classified <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>canary</b> as a subspecies of the European serin and assigned {{them to the}} genus Fringilla. Decades later, Cuvier reclassified them into the genus Serinus and there they have remained. <b>The</b> Atlantic <b>canary's</b> closest relative is the European serin, and the two can produce on average 25% fertile hybrids if crossed.|$|R
40|$|Dermanyssus gallinae is a {{haematophagous}} ectoparasite {{responsible for}} anemia, weight loss, dermatitis and {{a decrease in}} egg production. Dermanyssus gallinae {{may play a role in}} the modulation of the host immune system, maybe predisposing the host to some bacterial infections such as chlamydiosis. This is an important zoonosis. Humans are exposed to Chlamydia psittaci through inhalation of the agent dispersed from the infected birds. In this study, a syndrome observed in an aviary of canaries was investigated. A heavy infestation by D. gallinae was reported. Simultaneously, a C. psittaci infection was molecularly confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>canaries.</b> Combined therapy was applied successfully. The association of C. psittaci with the examined mites has been confirmed. Therefore, we think that D. gallinae have played a role in the spreading of C. psittaci infection among <b>the</b> <b>canaries.</b> Moreover, D. gallinae could have played an important role predisposing <b>the</b> <b>canaries</b> to <b>the</b> development of chlamydiosis, by inducing anemia and debilitation. The control of mites in the aviaries may represent a crucial step for the prevention of important infection such as chlamydiosis in birds and humans...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands were colonised in two waves. The {{first step}} was the {{occupation}} of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3–1.8 mya.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Western <b>Canary</b> Islands goldcrest, Regulus regulus ellenthalerae, is a {{very small}} {{passerine}} bird in the kinglet family. It is restricted to <b>the</b> western <b>Canary</b> Islands of La Palma and El Hierro where it is a non-migratory resident.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> waterschlager <b>canary</b> is <b>the</b> most robust {{example of}} {{unilateral}} syringeal dominance, creating song of which 90% of the syllables {{are produced by}} the left syrinx, as determined by recording respiratory pressure and airflow through each side during singing. Waterschlager canaries with left tracheosyringeal nerve cuts are only able to produce up to 26% of the pre-operation syllable repertoire. <b>The</b> waterschlager <b>canary</b> strain is conspecific to <b>the</b> domestic <b>canary</b> but has been inbred by humans for its beautiful song. <b>The</b> outbred domestic <b>canary,</b> however, does not exhibit the strong lateralization of <b>the</b> waterschlager <b>canary.</b> Possibly explaining their strong left lateralization, <b>canaries</b> of <b>the</b> waterschlager strain contain an inherited auditory defect that decreases their sensitivity by up to 40 dB to sounds higher than 2 kHz, which are produced mainly by {{the right side of}} the syrinx.|$|R
5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{goldcrest}} taxa are {{found on the}} Atlantic islands of Macaronesia.

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from <b>the</b> <b>Canary</b> Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} {{the ongoing}} series, DC Comics {{published}} a four-part bi-monthly Black Canary miniseries in which Green Arrow teamed up with Black Canary to help get Sin into school and establish a new life. This series concluded with <b>the</b> Black <b>Canary</b> accepting his proposal. This resulted in DC Comics publishing three interconnected specials revolving around <b>the</b> Green Arrow/Black <b>Canary</b> wedding that tied into that month's [...] "Countdown" [...] stories. These were <b>The</b> Black <b>Canary</b> Wedding Planner, JLA Wedding Special, as well as <b>The</b> Green Arrow/Black <b>Canary</b> Wedding Special. <b>The</b> wedding special worked as a lead-in for a new Green Arrow/Black <b>Canary</b> series.
