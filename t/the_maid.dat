Despite her hatred of the British red coats she accepts them and by her conduct dismisses their doubts about her loyalty.

40|$|Claire and Solange are <b>the</b> <b>maids</b> in Jean Genet’s <b>The</b> <b>Maids.</b> Having no {{life outside}} their servitude, <b>the</b> <b>maids</b> are “the other,” the {{submissive}} and subordinate. <b>The</b> <b>maids</b> invented a make-believe {{world in which}} they play roles as being a mistress and a servant. In {{the absence of the}} real Madame, Claire and Solange exercise a ritual of Madame humiliating her servant who in turn is supposed to murder her. The shifting of power is seen as <b>the</b> <b>maids</b> who are socially powerless threaten to murder Madame and take the power. However, the ritual never comes to its ends; Claire is never able to kill Madame played by Solange. Not being proud of themselves, <b>the</b> <b>maids</b> do not have a compelling basis for their rebellion. As <b>the</b> oppressed, <b>the</b> <b>maids</b> tend to be reactive, and their values are accordingly weaker, while Madame, representing the ruling class, actively controls their destiny with stronger values. Having been tried but unable to conduct the crime of killing Madame, both in the make-believe world and in reality, Solange finally seeks an escape in the illusory criminal world in which she is already the famous criminal. Having tried too long to come to term with being the “other,” Solange finally breaks down and becomes everyone else. Key words: the other, make-believe, the oppressed, the ruling class, shifting of power. ...|$|R

5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. <b>The</b> <b>maid</b> respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to <b>the</b> <b>maid.</b>|$|E

Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although they acted alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from <b>the</b> <b>Maid</b> of Heaven.|$|E

Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs.

He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with <b>the</b> <b>maid.</b>|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that <b>the</b> <b>maid</b> would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God shall make manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of <b>the</b> <b>Maid</b> of Heaven he claimed to have had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately to the prison city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died.

5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently.

In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. <b>The</b> <b>maid</b> asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök has begun, or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return.|$|E
