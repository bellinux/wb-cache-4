40|$|Introduction: <b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> {{with high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality rates {{are one of the}} most important problems of the world. Several factors have been described for the occurrence of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> Two of them are traffic congestion and road density which have infrequently been reported in the Turkish literature. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> population size, and the number of motor vehicles in Turkey. Material and methods: The crude data were obtained from the web page of the Turkish Statistical Institute. They was standardized for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles, or every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> The system of Statistical Regions was used in the classification. Results: In Turkey, the total number of inhabitants was 74, 724, 269 and the number of motor vehicles was 16, 089, 528 in 2011. As a result of 131, 845 road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> 3, 835 people died and 238, 074 people were injured. In the evaluation of  the distribution of the number of motor vehicles for every one million population, the distribution of the number of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population and every one million motor vehicles,  the distribution of the number of people died in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> and the distribution of the number of people injured in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> were all statistically significant.

ResultsFrom 2003 to 2005, the numbers of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> injuries and deaths {{as well as the}} mortality rates per 100 000 persons and per 10 000 vehicles declined in China. Until 2005, the total number of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> decreased to 450 000 and deaths to 99 000, with the mortality rate per 10 000 vehicles being 7. 6 persons. While the drivers and passengers accounted for 33. 2 % and 26. 6 % of death casualties respectively in 2005. Most <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> were caused by drivers, especially those with driving experience less than 3 years. <b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred on suburban roads accounted for 60 %.

This paper presents an effective approach to spatially identifying potential casualty areas and their {{economic loss}}es. In this study, {{five years of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> data, from 2007 to 2011, collected in the City of St. Louis and the adjacent counties, is used. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) -based techniques, e. g. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), two maps are generated and compared: 1) <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> rate map {{based on the number}} of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> per year and 2) the economic costs map. The locations with high economic costs but with low accident rates are identified and shown in a 3 -D visualization format. The results can be used as a foundation for the <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> cost estimation related research and serves as a guideline for practitioners to investigate the areas with high <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> severity levels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> {{have become}} a more and more {{important}} factor that restrict the development of economy and threaten the safety of human beings. Considering the complexity and uncertainty of the influencing factors on <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> forecasting {{can be regarded as}} a grey system with unknown and known information, so be analyzed by grey system theory. Grey models require only a limited amount of data to estimate the behavior of unknown systems. In this paper, first, the original predicted values of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> are separately obtained by the GM (1, 1) model, the Verhulst model and the DGM(2, 1) model. The results of these models on predicting road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> show that the forecasting accuracy of the GM(1, 1) is higher than the Verhulst model and the DGM(2, 1) model. Then, the GM(1, 1) model is applied to predict road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> in Fars province...|$|R
