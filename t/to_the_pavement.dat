5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide made their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man {{was hit in the}} head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Profiled {{thermoplastic}} markings {{are created}} by fusing thermoplastic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> and create alternating elevation and recession pattern. This can be done as inverted-profile markings or raised-profile markings. Inverted-profile markings {{are created by}} pressing a cog rolling over the markings while they are wet to make them corrugated. Raised-profile markings are created by extruding extra thickness of thermoplastic at a specific interval to create bumps. Raised-profile markings are sometime known as convex traffic lines.|$|E

25|$|Ben Wilson (born 1963) is an English {{wood carver}} and {{outsider}} artist. The {{son of an}} artist, Wilson {{grew up in a}} creative environment and attended art school. His distaste for industrial waste, cars and rubbish eventually turned into an art form. He creates tiny works of art by painting chewing gum stuck <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> Initially, his work garnered him unwanted attention from the authorities, but because he is not defacing private property but merely painting rubbish, he was found to be breaking no law. In addition to the chewing gum art, Wilson paints and sculpts. He has exhibited his paintings and sculptures in England, the United States, Germany, Ireland, Finland, France and Serbia.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by {{pursuing}} flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Tongue River has a road {{running along}} {{almost all of}} its length, as do the major tributaries, but the {{predominance}} of gravel roads over paved roads {{is a testament to}} the remoteness of the region. In the Tongue River valley, starting from Miles City and going up the river there are about 30 miles of pavement to the community of Garland, then 35 miles of gravel, followed by about 7 miles of paved road into Ashland, where U.S. Highway 212 is encountered. South of Ashland, continuing up the valley, there is another 20 miles of paved road, then another 38 miles of gravel roads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> above the Tongue River Reservoir, followed by 10 miles of pavement to the Montana/Wyoming state line. In Wyoming a network of paved roads follow the Tongue river westward to Ranchester and Dayton, where the Tongue comes out of the Big Horn Mountains. A road from Dayton goes up the Tongue for a short distance into the mountains, after which contact with the Tongue River and its mountain branches is by hiking trail.|$|E

25|$|Late on 18 January, {{the main}} railway station in Berlin {{suffered}} from major structural damage. A two-ton girder fell from {{a height of}} 40metres (130ft), damaging an outside stairwell. The station was completely evacuated, as glass plates from the façade were coming loose and falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> below. On the early afternoon of 19 January, the station was {{opened to the public}} again. Discussion started as to whether the eight-month-old station was suffering from design failures, but these claims were rejected by both Deutsche Bahn and the architect. The girders provide no means of structural support and are, for architectural reasons, only lying on small supports similar to a shelf and not permanently fixed in place. The DB claimed that it will address the problem by welding additional supports in front of the girders, and that they would close the station at winds exceeding 8 bft until the problem was resolved. On the afternoon of 21 January 2007, the station was closed again to the public due to heavy winds at the time. and remained closed until 20:00 CET. Some politicians have suggested opening Berlin's Bahnhof Zoo for long-distance services again to have an alternative to Hauptbahnhof in cases of bad weather until the problem has been addressed, but the Deutsche Bahn has refused these suggestions on the claims that they would be both unfeasible and unnecessary.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} keep {{airports}} open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require [...] or more to be cleared.|$|E
500|$|In Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western Railway Co.

It built an underground convenience on Parliament Street near Bridge Street in London with access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> {{on either side}} of the street. London and North Western Railway Company, which owned property fronting Parliament Street and Bridge Street, objected to the construction. Lord Macnaghten considered whether the Corporation had constructed the subway [...] "as a means of crossing the street under colour and pretence of providing public conveniences which were not really wanted at that particular place", which would not have been authorized by statute. He concluded that the Corporation's primary object had been to construct the public conveniences, together with proper means of approaching and exiting from them. Thus, the scheme was not unlawful.|$|E

40|$|A {{perpetual}} {{asphalt concrete}} pavement test section was completed along US- 30 in Wayne County, OH, {{as part of}} the Wooster by-pass, in the fall of 2005. This project represents a collaborative effort between the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the asphalt concrete paving industry with the purpose of evaluating the performance of these novel pavements. Perpetual asphalt concrete pavements are designed to last more than 50 years without major structural rehabilitation or reconstruction, and needing only periodic surface renewal to remediate distresses confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>pavement</b> layer.

500|$|Lucan's {{friends and}} family were {{critical}} of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters {{that it did not}} serve [...] "any useful purpose at all". Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt [...] "great sadness and sorrow" [...] at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel [...] "awfully sorry" [...] for the countess. However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of [...] "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence" [...] came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46Lower Belgrave Street.|$|E
