5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant <b>tax</b> <b>hikes.</b> The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

50|$|In March 2014, at {{a conference}} in Abu Dhabi, Lawrence Summers {{expressed}} his concern about the negative effects of the <b>tax</b> <b>hike,</b> saying that the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> could damage the Japanese economy more seriously than early estimates. Although the Japanese government expects the Japanese economy to recover after the economy goes into short recession, Summers suggested that Japan's rebound was overestimated.|$|R
50|$|Anatole Kaletsky was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Abenomics, but since the Japanese government decided to raise the country's consumption tax rate to 10 percent, he expressed his concern that the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> could deal a more devastating blow to Japanese economy than expected. In 1997, the Japanese government raised the rate to 5 percent from 3 percent to tackle its debt of 50 percent of its GDP at that time, promising that the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> would be offset by income-tax reforms. But the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> ended up making the domestic consumption stumble, pushing the economy into recession. The country fell into a deflationary trap. Due to the country's long-running malaise, the government gross debt reached 200 percent of its GDP despite the increase of the sales tax. The IMF forecast that the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> in 2014 would cut Japan's economic growth from 2.5 percent in 2013 to 1.4 percent in 2014, but Kaletsky argues that this economic downturn is underestimated.|$|R
50|$|The {{consumption}} <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> from 5 to 8 {{per cent}} {{brought about the}} self-induced recession in 2014, which discouraged Japanese consumers from spending and gave them a signal of further austerity. The <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> seemed to start permanently damaging the Japanese economy. Japan's GDP contracted by 0.8 per cent in annual terms {{in the third quarter}} of 2015, which made Japan go into a technical recession.|$|R

His opponents claimed that the budget was balanced despite his votes to increase spending.|$|E
25|$|By 2017, nearly 70% {{of those}} on the exchanges could {{purchase}} insurance for less than $75/month after subsidies. The law was evaluated multiple times by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which scored it as a moderate deficit reducer, as it included <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> primarily on high income taxpayers (roughly the top 5%) and reductions in future Medicare cost increases, offsetting subsidy costs. No Republicans in the House and only a few in the Senate voted for the law.|$|E
25|$|The sooner {{austerity}} {{steps are}} taken (e.g., raising revenues or reducing spending {{or a combination}} of both), the smaller those changes can be to maintain or reduce the debt level projected in 2039. For example, under the baseline scenario, stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP at 74% (its current level) would require non-interest spending cuts and/or <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> of 1.2% of GDP annually if implemented in 2015, or 1.5% of GDP annually if begun in 2020. To bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its 40-year average of 39%, the austerity measures required would be 2.6% GDP if begun in 2015 and 3.2% GDP if begun in 2020. Over the 1974 to 2013 period, federal spending averaged 20.5% GDP and revenue 17.4% GDP. For scale, a 2% GDP reduction in spending would be approximately a 10% spending cut.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese {{government}} raised {{consumption tax}} rates from 3% to 5% in 1997, which worsened {{the recession and}} deflated the economy. The government raised the consumption tax in 1997 {{for the purpose of}} balancing its budget, and then the government revenue decreased by 4.5 trillion yen because consumption stumbled. The country recorded a GDP growth rate of 3 percent in 1996, but after the <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> the economy sank into recession. The nominal GDP growth rate was below zero for most of the 5 years after the <b>tax</b> <b>hike.</b> Japan's averaged annual wages grew during 1992-1997, but the wages started to decrease after the consumption <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> came into effect in 1997.

25|$|After {{sweeping}} {{victory in}} legislative election on 9 December 2012, Victor Ponta – {{supported by the}} Social Liberal Union – was named Prime Minister of Romania. His mandate was marked by corruption scandals and street protests. The demonstrations had various causes, among them the <b>tax</b> <b>hikes,</b> the exploitation of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing and the Roșia Montană Project. Hundreds of thousands of people, including doctors, teachers, students and laborers, took to the street to shout their dissatisfaction regarding his policies. Employees in transport and health system triggered several strikes in this period. Although mainly peaceful, the protests degenerated in some cases in clashes between demonstrators and law enforcers. Ponta Government was accused by national and international organizations of excessive {{use of force in}} the Revolt of Pungești. Ethnic Hungarians started a series of protests for the autonomy of Szeklerland, while the unionist movements (see Action 2012) demanded the unification of Romania and Moldova, both in Romania and over the Prut.|$|E

Greek Cypriot MPs reacted by resigning from their positions. Furthermore on 18 October, Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos called Greek Cypriots to engage in acts of civil disobedience until their demands for Enosis were fulfilled. On 21 October, 5,000 Greek Cypriots, mostly students, priests and city notables rallied {{in the streets of}} Nicosia while chanting pro–Enosis slogans. The crowd besieged the Government House, following three hours of stone throwing the building was set on fire, the rioters were eventually dispersed by police. At the same time British flags were stripped from public offices across the country, often being substituted with Greek ones. Order was restored by the beginning of November.The British accused the Greek general counsel in Nicosia Alexis Kyrou (a Greek nationalist of Cypriot descent) of instigating the revolt. Kyrou had indeed worked behind the scenes to create a united opposition front against the British prior to the revolt, in direct disobedience to the orders he received from Athens. A total of 7 protesters were killed, 30 were injured, 10 were exiled for life, while 2,606 received various punishments ranging from prison terms to fines on account of seditious activities.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Cunningham was {{challenged}} in his re-election campaign by Scott Ott, a Republican political newcomer {{associated with the}} conservative Tea Party movement. Ott accused Cunningham of avoiding a county tax increase only by depleting a tax relief fund established during Jane Ervin's administration, leaving the county {{in a position where}} future <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> would be necessary. For his part, Cunningham accused Ott of using scare tactics in his campaign and said he lacked the experience to lead the county. He also argued Republican county commissioners had actually increased spending. Cunningham defeated Ott in the general election by a voter count of 21,063 to 20,201, capturing 51 percent of the vote to Ott's 49 percent. In 2010, a 16.1 percent tax increase was proposed as part of the county budget, with Cunningham said was necessary due to difficult financial times, but would avoid the need to sell assets, deplete savings, impose massive layoffs, or reduce government services {{to the point that the}} problem would grow worse in subsequent years. It was the first county tax increase since 2003. The budget was ultimately passed. In 2011, Ott was elected to the county's board of commissioners in 2011, along with a slate of fellow conservatives who ran together on a ticket of reform, which heavily criticized the 16 percent county tax increase during their campaigns.|$|E

25|$|The iqtaʿ {{system was}} {{inherited}} from the Ayyubids and further organized under the Mamluks to fit their military needs. Iqtaʿat were a central component of the Mamluk power structure. The iqtaʿ of the Muslims differed from the European concept of fiefs in that iqtaʿ represented a right to collect revenue from a fixed territory and was accorded to an officer (emir) as income and as a financial source to provision his soldiers. However, prior to the Mamluks' rise, there was a growing tendency of iqtaʿ holders to treat their iqtaʿ as personal property, which they passed down to their descendants. The Mamluks effectively {{put an end to}} this tendency, with the exception of some areas, namely in Mount Lebanon, where longtime Druze iqtaʿ holders, who became part of the halqa, were able to resist the abolition of their hereditary iqtaʿat. In the Mamluk era, the iqtaʿ was an emir's principal source of income, and starting in 1337, Mamluk iqtaʿ holders would lease or sell rights to their iqtaʿat to non-mamluks in order to derive greater revenues. By 1343, the practice was common and by 1347, the sale of iqta'at became taxed. The revenues emanating from the iqtaʿ also served as a more stable source of income than other methods the Mamluks sometimes employed, including <b>tax</b> <b>hikes,</b> the sale of administrative posts and extortion of the population. According to historian J. van Steenbergen, The iqtaʿ system was fundamental in assuring a legitimized, controlled and guaranteed access to the resources of the Syro-Egyptian realm to an upper level of Mamluk society that was primarily military in form and organization. As such it was a fundamental feature of Mamluk society, on the one hand giving way to a military hierarchy that crystallized into an even more developed economic hierarchy and that had substantial economic interests in society at large; on the other hand, it deeply characterized the realm's economic and social development, its agriculture, grain trade, and rural demography in particular.|$|E

50|$|IMF {{affirmed that}} Japan's nominal GDP {{contracted}} by $1.8 trillion during 2012-15 while real GDP contracted {{at an annual}} rate of 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014, after the Consumption <b>Tax</b> <b>hike</b> came into effect in April.

500|$|It {{has been}} a long known belief that {{austerity}} measures will always reduce the GDP growth in the short term. Some economists believing in Keynesian policies criticised the timing and amount of austerity measures being called for in the bailout programmes, as they argued such extensive measures should not be implemented during the crisis years with an ongoing recession, but if possible delayed until the years after some positive real GDP growth had returned. In October 2012, a report published by International Monetary Fund (IMF) also found, that <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> and spending cuts during the most recent decade had indeed damaged the GDP growth more severely, compared to what had been expected and forecasted in advance (based on the [...] "GDP damage ratios" [...] previously recorded in earlier decades and under different economic scenarios). Already a half-year earlier, several European countries {{as a response to the}} problem with subdued GDP growth in the eurozone, likewise had called for the implementation of a new reinforced growth strategy based on additional public investments, to be financed by growth-friendly taxes on property, land, wealth, and financial institutions. In June 2012, EU leaders agreed as a first step to moderately increase the funds of the European Investment Bank, in order to kick-start infrastructure projects and increase loans to the private sector. A few months later 11 out of 17 eurozone countries also agreed to introduce a new EU financial transaction tax to be collected from 1 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} criticism over the austerity measures implemented by most European nations to counter this debt crisis. US economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that an abrupt return to [...] "'non-Keynesian' financial policies" [...] {{is not a}} viable solution. Pointing at historical evidence, he predicts that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as Greece and Spain will prolong and deepen their recessions. Together with over 9,000 signatories of [...] "A Manifesto for Economic Sense" [...] Krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as EU economic commissioner Olli Rehn and most European finance ministers that [...] "budget consolidation" [...] revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul. In a 2003 study that analysed 133 IMF austerity programmes, the IMF's independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth. In early 2012 an IMF official, who negotiated Greek austerity measures, admitted that spending cuts were harming Greece. In October 2012, the IMF said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programmes have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected, and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected. Also Portugal did comparably better than Spain. The latter introduced drastic austerity measures but was unable not meet its EU budget deficit targets. On the other hand, Portugal's leftist coalition fought austerity (it increased the minimum wage by 25 percent and took back cuts in the pension system and the public sector) {{and at the same}} time reduced its budget deficit to below three percent in 2016. According to historian Florian Schui from University of St. Gallen no austerity program has ever worked.
