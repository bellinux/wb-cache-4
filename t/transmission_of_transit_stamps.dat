40|$|Transmission {{spectroscopy}} during planetary transits, {{which is}} based on the measurements of the variations of planet-to-star radius ratio as a function of wavelength, is a powerful technique to study the atmospheric properties <b>of</b> <b>transiting</b> planets. One <b>of</b> the main limitation of this technique is the effects of stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only by assessing the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates of planet-to-star radius ratio. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the impact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the <b>transmission</b> spectra <b>of</b> <b>transiting</b> exoplanets. We simulated this effect by generating a large number <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> light curves for different transiting planets, stellar spectral types, and for different wavelengths. Results of our simulations indicate that the anomalies inside the transit light curve can lead to a significant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star radius ratio as a function of wavelength. At short wavelengths, the effect can reach to a difference of up to 10 % in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking the signature of light scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Atmospheric scattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra toward blue for exoplanets HD 189733 b and GJ 3470 b. Here we show that these signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellar plages. Results also suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantify the effects of stellar activities on the <b>transmission</b> spectrum <b>of</b> a planet is to perform several observations during the transit epoch at the same wavelength. This will allow for identifying the possible variations in transit depth as a function of time due to stellar activity variability. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R

These observations aim to test whether the Rayleigh scattering haze detected at optical wavelengths extends into the near-infrared, or if it becomes transparent leaving molecular features to dominate the transmission spectrum. Due to saturation and non-linearity affecting the brightest (central) pixels of the spectrum, light curves were extracted from the blue and red ends of the spectra only, corresponding to wavelength ranges of 1. 099 – 1. 168 and 1. 521 – 1. 693 μm, respectively, for the first visit, and 1. 082 – 1. 128 and 1. 514 – 1. 671 μm for the second. The light curves were fitted using a Gaussian process model to account for instrumental systematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the transit parameters. This gives values of the planet-to-star radius ratio for the blue and red light curves of 0. 156 50 ± 0. 000 48 and 0. 156 34 ± 0. 000 32, respectively, for visit 1 and 0. 157 16 ± 0. 000 78 and 0. 156 30 ± 0. 000 37 for visit 2 (using a quadratic limb-darkening law).
