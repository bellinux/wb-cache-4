40|$|Intentional torts to {{the person}} are those torts which involve "intentional or wilful invasions of the {{physical}} and mental integrity of the person", such as intentional trespass {{to the person}} (battery, assault and false imprisonment), and can be distinguished from "negligent or careless invasions". 1 Although the historical distinction between negligence and trespass is based upon whether the defendant's act is direct or indirect, a trend towards fault-based categorisation {{of the law of}} torts has been recognised by a majority of the High Court in Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307 at [18]; see also Brennan J at [52]. Given the legislative changes to the law of negligence following the review of the law of negligence, 2 and particularly the damages restrictions which have been imposed, there has been renewed interest in the ancient <b>trespass</b> <b>actions.</b> Although difficult issues may arise in intentional tort claims such as proof of intention, 3 the extent to which insurance is available, 4 and whether vicarious liability will be imposed, 5 there may be advantages for plaintiffs who plead intentional torts, particularly trespass to the person. Some of the key legal advantages are that trespass is actionable per se; the defendant bears the onus of proof; the rules of causation and remoteness which relate to negligence actions may not apply to trespass actions; and exemplary and aggravated damages may be awarded. 6 In particular, the provisions of the Civil Liability Acts may not apply...|$|R

Nowadays {{there are a}} lot of parties offering transportation service in the shape of car rents. It is purposed in order to facilitate the persons who don't have their private vehicle. Herein, one of those who conduct activities of car rent is CV. Sima Transindo. In conducting car rent should be conducted a car rental agreement in order to anticipate the emergence of misconduct from the part of renter. This research discussed on how is legal implementation of CV. Sima Trasindo by the reason of mortgaging object is car by the part of car renter. In this research the method used was empirical research method. The data used in this empirical legal research was primary data, whereas secondary data was used for supporting data. Data gained was classified and grouped and then qualitatively analyzed. The result of this research is legal protection to CV. Sima Trasindo as the result of rental object mortgaging has not been ruled yet in rental agreement that was made between the parties. However it is ruled in the Article 1235 to Article 1253 Civil Code on Agreement, Article 1365 Civil Code on the legal <b>trespassing</b> <b>action</b> and Article 1559 Civil Code on Prohibiting the existence of guarantee or mortgaging to other parties in this matter is used for complementary law that has legal authority and can be made as principles for protecting CV. Sima Trasindo from the existence of rental object mortgaging. The suggestion can be submitted by author is in order to guarantee legal protection to CV. Sima Trasindo, thus legislations on the risk are more supported and the part of CV. Sima Trasindo should be more selective in selecting customer in order there will not happen unwilling conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|The New Law of Torts third edition {{continues}} {{to question whether}} foundational principles and policies of torts law, reflect the social and moral values of modern Australian society. Living {{up to its name}} as The New Law of Torts, this book has been up-dated with the latest legislative and judicial development as well as the recent major cases, reflecting the changing nature of tort law. This is an essential and accessible text as it provides a clear and succinct discussion of the interface between the statutory regime in each jurisdiction and the common law. It comprehensively covers the law as it is applicable to the whole of Australia. The book has clearly delineated parts, sections and topics for each genus of torts (<b>trespass,</b> <b>action</b> on the case, statutory wrongs, etc.), and each species (battery, assault, negligence, nuisance). Headings and sub-headings provide useful breaks in the text, and selected cases are used not only as authorities, but also as illustrations of principle and judicial reasoning...|$|E

5000|$|In the 1899 case McGregor v. McGregor, [...] British Columbia Supreme Court justice Irving wrote: “An {{action of}} {{replevin}} may be brought (1) where goods have been wrongfully distrained or (2) where goods have been otherwise, i.e. otherwise than by distress, wrongfully taken or detained. The word ‘wrongfully’ is applicable to both cases. ‘Wrongfully’ ... imports the infringement of some right, and any invasion {{of the civil rights}} of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history of replevin action in England is traced (as) ... ‘The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods. Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right to replevy to the party who could maintain trespass or trover. It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three <b>actions,</b> <b>trespass,</b> trover and replevin are classed... as actions of tort, I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{the courts}} held that an action for trover would lie for blacks, {{as if they}} were chattels, but this was {{reasoned}} {{on the grounds that they}} were infidels rather than slaves, and lacked the rights enjoyed by Christians; (reasoning which would later find echoes in the U.S. case of Dred Scott v. Sandford 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857)) but Judge Holt was to later reject this analysis, and also denied the possibility of bringing an assumpsit on the sale of a negro in England: [...] "as soon as a negro comes to England he is free; one may be a villein in England, but not a slave." [...] However, this comment was construed as more of an admonition against careless pleading rather than a reproach to slave dealers. The plaintiff was felt to have simply overdone the fictions, and was allowed to amend his declaration to allege the sale of a slave in the royal colony of Virginia, where slavery was recognised by colonial law, and the English courts would recognise and enforce the rights arising under Virginian law. Slaves were regularly bought and sold on the Liverpool and London markets, and actions on contract concerning slaves were common in the 18th century without any serious suggestion that they were void for illegality. Even the statement made in the various trover decisions appear to have been directed to good pleading rather than the legality of slavery: a pleading which averred the conversion of a [...] "negro" [...] rather than a [...] "slave" [...] would fail, as there was no inherent reason why a black person should not be a free man. In 1706 Chief Justice Holt refused an action for trover in relation to a slave holding that no man could have property in another, but held that an alternative <b>action,</b> <b>trespass</b> quare captivum suum cepit, would be available, which was actually felt to have strengthened the legal position of slaveowners.|$|R

"By my soul," [...] exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, {{suddenly}} firing another volley, [...] "that fellow is, and {{his father}} was, and his grandfather was, the most stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by some inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but a walking-stick's! The whole of that family are the most solemnly conceited and consummate blockheads!

The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon that execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is nearly driven out of his body.
