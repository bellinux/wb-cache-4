Kurdish nationalists are tempted to exaggerate it, and governments of the region to understate it. In Turkey only those Kurds who do not speak Turkish are officially counted for census purposes as Kurds, yielding a very low figure." [...] In [...] Turkey: A Country Study, a 1995 online publication of the U.S. Library of Congress, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> chapter about Kurds in Turkey where it is stated that [...] "Turkey's censuses do not list Kurds as a separate ethnic group.

In 1995 {{estimates of the number}} of Kurds in Turkey is about 8.5 million" [...] out of 61.2 million, or 13% of the population at that time. Kurdish national identity is far from being limited to the Kurmanji-language community, as many Kurds whose parents migrated towards Istanbul or other large non-Kurdish cities mostly speak Turkish, which is one of the languages used by the Kurdish nationalist publications.|$|E

[...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers were saying that Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote the beginning of the couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other.

[...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down. But now, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E
