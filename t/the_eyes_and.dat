5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nostrils. Between <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E

5|$|Halfbeaks carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding {{at the water}} surface. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{nostrils}} {{are at the top}} of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes.

5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E

5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds have a black patch in front of <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E

5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond the level of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> mixes with {{the white of the}} face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

5|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another {{illusion}} to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E

5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh {{described}} the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, Ceratops and Triceratops. In 1890 Marsh classified {{them together in}} the family Ceratopsidae and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named Agathaumidae in 1891. Cope redescribed Monoclonius as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> a large frill.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

50|$|The female is 12 cm {{long and}} weighs 8 g. She {{differs from the}} male in that she has green-spotted white underparts, a white spot behind <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> a white stripe below <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> a white-cornered shallowly-forked black tail. Young birds {{resemble}} the adult of the same sex, but are duller, bronze-tinged below and have buff throats.|$|R

5|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{peptides}} {{and other}} substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including hyaluronidase, serotonin, phospholipase A2, and several kallikrein-like glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite. Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including horridum venom, which causes hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging of <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> <b>and</b> helothermine, which causes lethargy, partial paralysis of the limbs, and hypothermia in rats. Most are similar in form to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes smooth muscle and regulates water and electrolyte secretion between the small and large intestines. These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> <b>and</b> a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on {{the rock}} art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
40|$|Much {{important}} {{information can be}} obtained at necropsy by the pathological examination of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> its adnexal structures in adults and children. This information {{may be related to}} the cause of death (for example, violent shaking trauma in physical child abuse), or may pertain to disease processes affecting <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>the</b> orbit, <b>and</b> surrounding structures outside the orbit. This article reviews the technical methods used to remove the following: the vitreous (for example, for biochemistry); <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> itself (anterior approach); <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> orbital contents (posterior approach); <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> orbit <b>and</b> orbital walls; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> orbital walls, <b>and</b> surrounding structures. The removal of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> adnexal ocular structures must be recognised as a "culturally sensitive" issue, which must be approached cautiously. It should only be undertaken for sound scientific reasons, with the fully informed consent of the relatives and/or the coroner (or equivalent authority), and with properly agreed procedures for the eventual retention or disposal of the ocular tissues. For this reason, this article reviews not only the scientific indications and methods for the removal of such tissues, but also the legal and ethical issues that must underpin this pathology "best practice"...|$|R
