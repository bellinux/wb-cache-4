5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E

In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of bin Laden, some {{officials}} from <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout.

5|$|Cheney was a {{prominent}} member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), {{commonly known as the}} Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> was accused of improper political and business ties.

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration,</b> feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it.
