40|$|The {{selection}} of appropriate <b>tyre</b> size and <b>inflation</b> pressure {{for a particular}} load and soil condition are crucial to minimising soil compaction and ensuring soil sustainability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the changes in soil bulk density from soil deformation data, produced by a selected range of combine-harvester tyres, inflated to the recommended inflation pressures, and at high axle load (10. 5 tonnes) to provide a valuable indicator for tyre selection. Results showed that the initial soil strength was the main factor influencing soil deformation and soil bulk density changes beneath the tyres. In addition, increased tyre size and low inflation pressure reduced both soil deformation and the resultant increase in soil bulk density. The increases in soil bulk density after one passage of the tyres over the soil were approximately 25 % for the low bulk density soil (1. 20 g cm - 3) and between 2. 3 % and 5 % for the high bulk density soil (1. 60 g cm - 3). The advantage of increasing tyre size and lowering inflation pressure was also reflected in the results obtained from penetrometer resistance: at the centre of the wheeling, the tyre with the highest inflation pressure (2. 5 bar) gave a significantly higher increase in penetration resistance compared with the <b>tyres</b> with lower <b>inflation</b> pressures (2. 2 bar and 1. 9 bar). Linear relationships between drop-cone penetration and maximum rut depth were established; these data were subsequently related to those obtained from penetration resistance and initial soil bulk density; therefore, the increase in soil bulk density induced after driving a tyre over the soil can be determined for various tyre configurations and initial soil conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Heavy {{sugarbeet}} harvesters may compact subsoil. But it is {{very difficult}} to study this by field experiments that resemble agricultural practice. Therefore, an analysis was made by a finite element method (FEM) for a relevant calcaric fluvial soil profile, the mechanical properties of which were largely known. Measuring data of this Lobith loam soil includes preconsolidation stress, compression index and swelling index, all as a function of depth. Using these three types of soil parameters calculations have been done for <b>tyre</b> sizes, <b>inflation</b> pressures and wheel loads that occur with heaviest sugarbeet harvesters available on the European market in 1999. Because no values on soil cohesion were available, the calculations were done for several cohesion levels. The results include the detection of regions with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity and regions with cap plasticity (compaction hardening). For the soil studied-a typical soil strength profile for arable land with ploughpan in the Netherlands in the autumn of 1977 -all studied combinations of wheel load and inflation pressure did not induce compaction in and below the ploughpan. The size of the region with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity decreased with increasing cohesion. It appeared from a sensitivity analysis that, although soil modelling may use a great number of soil parameters, the most important parameters seem to be: preconsolidation stress and cohesion. There is an urgent need for data of these parameters that are measured on a great range of subsoils and subsoil conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the fracture toughness of a pneumatic tyre sidewall was developed. Conventional methods of fracture toughness determination require the structural material to be tested independently of the structure. The proposed method allows frature toughness to be measured directly from the type sidewall. Two advantages follow: (i) elimination {{of the need for}} duplicating the identical cured sidewall properties in the testpiece, and (ii) avoidance of the buckling inherent in thin sidewall test specimens. The pneumatic tyre chosen for the investigation was a 7. 75 - 14 bias passenger tyre with a two-ply nylon carcass. An artificial crack was created in the tyre sidewall and the cracked tyre was loaded by inflation pressure. The experimental parameters taken from the <b>tyre</b> include the <b>inflation</b> pressure, volume, and crack opening area at different crack lengths. Based on a quasistatic energy analysis, the pressure-volumecrack length diagram was used to graphically determine the sidewall fracture toughness. In addition, an equation based on the reciprocal theorem for a cracked body and netting analysis was derived and used to analytically determine the sidewall fracture toughness. The computed fracture toughness compares reasonaly well with the measured G values via the experimental approach. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{present the}} {{preliminary}} findings of research aimed at determining {{the character of}} the contact pressure distribution of crane tyres and estimating their influence on the deformation of pavements. The impetus for the research was: (i) the requirement of the (Australian) regulation for a minimum tyre size of 20. 5 -inch (525 mm) for all-terrain cranes with a maximum allowable axle load of 12 tonnes; and (ii) the Australian crane industry’s argument for the adoption of smaller <b>tyres</b> with reduced <b>inflation</b> pressures based on the expectation of increased contact area, hence reduced contact pressure. The paper describes the use of pressure-sensitive film to generate a digital field proportional to contact pressure. The results show that the contact pressure distributions measured were complex and not uniformly-distributed over a circular area as is assumed in conventional pavement analysis. The pressure distribution maps revealed large localised contact pressures (often greater that three times the mean net contact pressure) at the edge of individual tread blocks. The measured data were used to study the effects of realistic contact pressure distributions on the deformation rates of flexible pavements, using Finite Element Analysis based on a non-linear visco-plastic strain and temperature dependent constitutive model.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors on low profile implement tyres affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - ply rating - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, harrowed fields, ploughed fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher ply rating - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft <b>tyre</b> with low <b>inflation</b> pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a new method of measuring rolling resistance in treadmill cycling and to establish its sensitivity and reproducibility. One participant was asked to keep a bicycle in equilibrium on a treadmill without pedalling at a constant speed of 5. 56 m x s(- 1), which was held in place in the front by a dynamometer. For each condition, the method consisted of 11 measurements of the force required to hold the cycle at different treadmill slopes (0 - 10 %, increment 1 %). The coefficient of rolling resistance was calculated based on the forces applied to the bicycle in equilibrium. To test the sensitivity of the method, the bicycle was successively equipped with three tyre types (700 x 28, 700 x 23, 700 x 22) and inflation pressure was set at 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1100 kPa. To test the reproducibility of the method, a second experimenter repeated all measurements done with the 700 x 23 tyres. The method was sensitive enough to detect an effect of both <b>tyre</b> type and <b>inflation</b> pressure (P < 0. 001 : two-way ANOVA). The measurement of the coefficient of rolling resistance by two separate experimenters resulted in a small bias of 0. 00029 (95 % CI, - 0. 00011 to 0. 00068).

40|$|Stability {{and safety}} of road {{vehicles}} are largely affected by tyre properties. Single-track vehicles are characterised by weakly damped modes of vibration (weave and wobble) and therefore this phenomenon is even more important. This article focuses {{on the study of}} both steady-state and transient properties of motorcycle and scooter tyres in the presence of very low and very high inflation pressures. The steady-state properties are defined as lateral forces (side-slip and camber forces) and yaw torques (self-aligning and twisting). The transient properties are described in terms of relaxation length, which represents the distance needed to reach a certain percentage of the steady-state value of the tyre force. Experimental tests are carried out on a specific rotating disk machine. Three sets of tyres are analysed. Steady-state properties are measured by increasing step by step the values of camber and side-slip angles. Transient properties are studied carrying out tests with harmonic sideslip excitation and measuring the phase lag between the excitation (input) and the tyre force (output).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted radial tyre under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included.

The fibber reinforced parts of the tyre including ply, belts, and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial <b>tyre</b> subjected to <b>inflation</b> and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform {{contact pressure}} over a circular contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre contact pressure measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of contact pressure. This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre contact pressure. That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform contact pressure representation and the measured 3 -D contact pressure is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same contact pressure for different combinations of axle loading and inflation pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the contact pressure observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D contact pressure representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 inflation pressures and 3 <b>tyre</b> loads. The <b>inflation</b> pressures were for a recommended inflation pressure and then plus and minus 200 kPa. The tyre loading was for a maximum European axle loading and then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre contact pressure can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D contact pressure in comparison to uniform contact pressure for all combinations of <b>inflation</b> pressure and <b>tyre</b> loading. The difference between the two contact pressure representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D contact pressure has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D contact pressure must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform contact pressure generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of <b>inflation</b> pressure and <b>tyre</b> loading. If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform contact pressure representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R

40|$|Compaction of {{farmland}} can {{in many cases}} be negative. A poorer water infiltration in the soil profile, bad conditions for root growth, slower decomposition rate of organic material, {{and an increase in}} traction power are some of the negative effects. The most serious compaction is the one appearing below the depth of tillage, as it will exist for many years. The factors having the greatest influence on the amount of soil compaction is the wheel load, the tyre equipment used, the <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure and the water content in the soil. Factors discussed in this report are wheel load, <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure, the stress in the soil, the stress distribution in the contact area and the impact of these parameters on the amount of compaction. Three different experiments were carried out on three sites in the autumn in 2002. The first experiment was carried out at Svenstorp farm in southern Sweden. During dry conditions the stress and the deformation in the soil was measured under a 3 -row, a 6 -row and a 9 -row sugar beet harvester that were driving with different loads. The 6 -row harvester was also driven with different tire inflation pressures. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, macroporosity and bulk density was measured in the topsoil after a single pass with the harvesters. The second experiment took place at Krenkerup farm in southern Denmark. Two different systems for sugar beet harvesting were evaluated. The first system contained one big harvester only that had a loading capacity of 28 tons and a total weight of 55 tons. Because of the great loading capacity, it was able to bring the sugar beets {{to the end of the}} field. The other system contained a smaller harvester, with a total weight of 27 tons and two field trailers that were supporting the harvester all the time. The measurements were concentrated on stress and deformation in the subsoil and also stress and stress distribution in the topsoil under the different tyres. The last experiment took place at Ultuna, Uppsala, Sweden. In this experiment the stress and the stress distribution in the topsoil was measured when driving with different wheel loads and <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures. The results from Svenstorp showed the positive effects of a reduced <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure on soil stress, saturated hydraulic conductivity and macro porosity in the topsoil. Traffic by the 6 -row harvester, driving with a high <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure, was resulting in the lowest rate of saturated hydraulic conductivity, independently of the load. Also the boogie wheels of the 3 - row harvester were resulting in low infiltration rates, independently of the load. The measurements at Krenkerup showed that one passage over the soil with the big harvester deformed the soil more at both 30 cm and 70 cm depth, than one passage with the small harvester followed by the field trailer. The highest stress both at 30 cm and 70 cm depth was measured under one of the three tyres of the big harvester. There was a very even stress distribution between the three axles of the field trailer. Measurements at Ultuna showed that a higher wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure was kept constant. A lower <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure resulted in a more even stress distribution in the contact area. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) A reduced <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure will greatly reduce compaction of the topsoil. 2) The deformation in the soil was greater after passing once with a 55 ton harvester than after passing once with a 27 ton harvester plus a field trailer. 3) An increase in wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure was kept the same...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the effect}} of {{overinflated}} tyre pressure and increased heavy vehicles’ axle load on flexible pavements has become a subject of great concern because of the higher stress levels induced and damage caused to road pavements. This paper aims to evaluate {{the effect of}} variable <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures (using actual tyre contact/footprint area) to determine the responses of flexible pavement. A full scale experiment was conducted on a heavy vehicle with 1 : 1 : 2 axle configuration, 10 R 20 tyre size and attached trailer with constant axle load. Measurements were made for actual tyre-pavement contact area. KENPAVE linear elastic program was then used to analyse {{the effects of the}} measured actual tyre-pavement contact area and the results was compared using conventional circular tyre contact area. A comparative analysis was then made between the actual contact area and the conventional circular tyre contact area. It was found that high <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure produce smaller contact area, giving more detrimental effect on the flexible pavement. It was also found that the temperature of tyres when the heavy vehicles are operational give less significant impact on <b>tyre</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure for the Malaysian climate...|$|E
