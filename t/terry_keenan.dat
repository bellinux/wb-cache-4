50|$|The Borough {{joined the}} Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1886 and {{has played in}} every season since then. In 1897, Port Melbourne was {{left out of the}} group of eight clubs which formed the {{breakaway}} VFL competition, despite having regularly been about the sixth- or seventh- best performing team onfield. Historian <b>Terry</b> <b>Keenan</b> theorised that the likeliest reason for Port Melbourne's exclusion was the reputation for the poor behaviour that its players and spectators had developed over the previous decade; its rivalry with and proximity to the influential South Melbourne Football Club {{and the fact that the}} club had supported the gate equalisation measures which the breakaway clubs were trying to escape were also speculated to have contributed to the decision.|$|E
