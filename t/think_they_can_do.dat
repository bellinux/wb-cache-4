Research ethics review has seen more than its fair share of change over the past 10 years.

40|$|The {{following}} quotation {{raises an}} issue fundamental to career guidance practitioners’ professional the identity: "We {{need to be}} mindful {{that the concept of}} guidance doesn’t get undermined, because one of the issues is everybody <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> guidance. " (Senior career guidance manager, England, 2001). The complex multi-faceted environment within which career guidance is delivered requires practitioners to respond positively and operate ‘professionally’ to achieve visions created by social planners who may not share the same understanding of what constitutes guidance. In an age where everyone now lays claim to being a ‘professional’ (Fournier, 1999), guidance practitioners’ professional identity is threatened, changed and subtly redesigned to accommodate new circumstances. This paper examines influences on the formation of professional identity, and outlines research based in Aotearoa New Zealand. By drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, the location of the subject (i. e. the career guidance practitioner) in relation to these discourses becomes significant, and the concept of ‘care of the self’ relating to identity formation becomes important in understanding practitioners’ own attitudes and feelings towards their work...|$|R

60|$|To {{provide for}} us in our necessities {{is not in the}} power of government. It would be a vain {{presumption}} in statesmen to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it. The people maintain them, and not they the people. It is in the power of government to prevent much evil; it can do very little positive good in this, or perhaps in anything else. It is not only so of the state and statesman, but of all the classes and descriptions of the rich: they are the pensioners of the poor, and are maintained by their superfluity. They are under an absolute, hereditary, and indefeasible dependence on those who labor and are miscalled the poor.|$|E

60|$|I think {{highly of}} Sterne--that is, {{of the first}} part of Tristram Shandy: for as to the latter part about the widow Wadman, it is stupid and disgusting; and the Sentimental Journey is poor sickly stuff. There {{is a great deal of}} {{affectation}} in Sterne, to be sure; but still the characters of Trim and the two Shandies[1] are most individual and delightful. Sterne's morals are bad, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> much harm to any one whom they would not find bad enough before. Besides, the oddity and erudite grimaces under which much of his dirt is hidden take away the effect for the most part; although, to be sure, the book is scarcely readable by women.|$|E

A strong force of police kept back the vast crowd, so as to let the firemen do their work undisturbed. It was deadly work they had to do! Not only were flames spouting from every window, but masses of brickwork and blazing beams were falling in various places, rendering the service full of danger. A London crowd is usually well-behaved, but there are sometimes a few forward geese in it who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> things better than other people.

60|$|Reader, if {{you come}} from the more sunny side of the Tweed--or even if, being a Scot, you have had the {{advantage}} to be born within the last twenty-five years, you may be induced to think this portrait of Queen Elizabeth, in Dame Quickly's piqued hat and green apron, somewhat overcharged in the features. But I appeal to my own contemporaries, who have known wheel-road, bridle-way, and footpath, for thirty years, whether they do not, every one of them, remember Meg Dods--or somebody very like her. Indeed, so much is this the case, that, about the period I mention, I should have been afraid to have rambled from the Scottish metropolis, in almost any direction, lest I had lighted upon some one of the sisterhood of Dame Quickly, who might suspect me of having showed her up {{to the public in}} the character of Meg Dods. At present, though it is possible that some one or two of this peculiar class of wild-cats may still exist, their talons must be much impaired by age; and I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> little more than sit, like the Giant Pope, in the Pilgrim's Progress, at the door of their unfrequented caverns, and grin at the pilgrims over whom they used formerly to execute their despotism.|$|E

"Well, lad," [...] he said, as Frank came up, [...] "this is a nasty scrape {{that your}} brother has got into; but I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} to him.

If it had been anyone else but Faulkner who had been in charge, I have no doubt it could have been managed. Of course, your brother ought not to have been there, but as he was only looking on, and taking no active part in the affair, he might have been released without any difficulty. However, I don't think you need worry yourself. Certainly, we shall not press the case against him. It is unfortunate that he used his tongue as sharply as he did to Mr. Faulkner, though I don't say but that he had great provocation, or that what he said was not perfectly true; still, it would have been much better left unsaid. However, I question if before the hearing is over Faulkner will not have cause to regret that he did not let your brother go home as soon as they got back here." ...|$|E

60|$|Doubtless {{many will}} reply {{that they can}} more easily {{conceive}} ten millions of special creations to have taken place, than they can conceive that ten millions of varieties have arisen by successive modifications. All such, however, will find, on inquiry, that they are under an illusion. This {{is one of the}} many cases in which men do not really believe, but rather believe they believe. It is not that they can truly conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place, but that they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so. Careful introspection will show them that they have never yet realized to themselves the creation of even one species. If they have formed a definite conception of the process, let them tell us how a new species is constructed, and how it makes its appearance. Is it thrown down from the clouds? or must we hold to the notion that it struggles up out of the ground? Do its limbs and viscera rush together from all the points of the compass? or must we receive the old Hebrew idea, that God takes clay and moulds a new creature? If they say that a new creature is produced in none of these modes, which are too absurd to be believed, then they are required to describe the mode in which a new creature may be produced--a mode which does not seem absurd; and such a mode they will find that they neither have conceived nor can conceive.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was near}} the close of a {{pleasant}} Saturday afternoon that I drew up my weary horse {{in front of a}} neat little dwelling in the village of N. This, as near as I could gather from description, was the house of my cousin, William Fletcher, the identical rogue of a Bill Fletcher of whom we have aforetime spoken. Bill had always been a thriving, push-ahead sort of a character, and during the course of my rambling life I had improved every occasional opportunity of keeping up our early acquaintance. The last time that I returned to my native country, after some years of absence, I heard of him as married and settled in the village of N., where he was conducting a very prosperous course of business, and shortly after received a pressing invitation to visit him at his own home. Now, as I had gathered from experience {{the fact that it is}} of very little use to rap one's knuckles off on the front door of a country house without any knocker, I therefore made the best of my way along a little path, bordered with marigolds and balsams, that led to the back part of the dwelling. The sound of a number of childish voices made me stop, and, looking through the bushes, I saw the very image of my cousin Bill Fletcher, as he used to be twenty years ago; the same bold forehead, the same dark eyes, the same smart, saucy mouth, and the same [...] "who-cares-for-that" [...] toss to his head.
