5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant the keep as <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>focus</b> for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
2500|$|Economy of force. The counter-insurgent regime {{must not}} overreact to guerrilla provocations, since this {{may indeed be}} what they seek to create a crisis in {{civilian}} morale. Indiscriminate use of firepower may only serve to alienate <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>focus</b> of counterinsurgency- {{the base of the}} people. Police level actions should guide the effort and take place in a clear framework of legality, even if under a State of Emergency. Civil liberties and other customs of peacetime may have to be suspended, but again, the counter-insurgent regime must exercise restraint, and cleave to orderly procedures. In the counter-insurgency context, [...] "boots on the ground" [...] are even more important than technological prowess and massive firepower, although anti-guerrilla forces should take full advantage of modern air, artillery and electronic warfare assets.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{majority}} of the nineteenth century, the left brain hemisphere was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>focus</b> of clinical research on language disorders (Brookshire, 2007). In the twentieth century, focus gradually shifted to include right hemisphere damage (Brookshire, 2007). It is now well established that language and cognition can be seriously impaired by unilateral right hemisphere brain damage. Specific cognitive tests can help diagnose the existence of right hemisphere brain damage and differentiate symptoms from those of left hemisphere damage. Unlike the aphasias, caused by left hemisphere damage and generally resulting in focused language deficits, right hemisphere brain damage can result in a variety of diffuse deficits which complicate formal testing of this disorder (Brookshire, 2007). These formal tests assess areas such as understanding humor, metaphors, sarcasm, facial expression, and prosody. However, not all individuals with right hemisphere brain damage have problems in language or communication and some may have no discernible symptoms. [...] Indeed, about half of patients with right hemisphere damage have intact communication abilities (Brookshire, 2007).|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>focus</b> for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
