5|$|Richardson {{returned}} to New Zealand in February 1919 and, based in Wellington, became administrator for General Headquarters of the New Zealand Military Forces. He also chaired the Reconstruction Committee {{which was established}} to reduce the New Zealand Military Forces to a peacetime setting. However, he soon <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work and the following year tendered his resignation. It was not accepted by the New Zealand Government and he remained in his role until early 1923. He was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre in 1922 for his services in the First World War, and also wrote a chapter on the education of soldiers, a subject {{in which he was}} particularly interested, for one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War.

5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E

5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian whaling ship, which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as a shepherd. He soon <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and began the life of a swagman, working from town to town as he travelled around the South Island.|$|E

This new romance caused the evil Stacy Keibler to turn against Wilson, {{and as a}} result of this, Wilson defected to the company. Wilson defeated Keibler in the first ever lingerie match at No Mercy. When the first ever brand separation of the company roster took place in April 2002, Wilson was drafted to SmackDown!. Shortly after this, as part of the storyline, Tajiri soon became jealous over the increased attention that Wilson received from other men, so he forced her to wear a geisha outfit, and he also appeared to mistreat her in matches.

The task was often difficult, for he had to agree to extreme {{budgetary}} constraints and disappoint the hopes of many officers who were left unemployed by the peace.

During his time at the Admiralty, Howe oversaw a number of innovations to signalling. Howe felt constantly undermined by Charles Middleton, the Comptroller of the Navy.

By 1788 Howe grew <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and he resigned his post as First Lord despite efforts to persuade him to stay.

[...] Private Middleton <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a {{football}} player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams such as the one at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls. [...] For the next several years Middleton would play a lot of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, and he said he never met a good football player who wasn't also a good soldier.|$|E
500|$|With Miranda {{imprisoned in}} Spain, Bolívar {{emerged as the}} new leader of the Venezuelan {{independence}} movement. He resolved {{that they would have}} to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Curaçao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General Antonio Nariño's republican armies in Venezuela's western neighbour, New Granada. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nariño's base at Tunja in the eastern Andes. Miranda's name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nariño's forces were mainly engaged around Popayán in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison. Rafter reports positively on MacGregor's conduct in Socorro, writing that [...] "by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [...] considerably improved the discipline of the troops", but some under his command disliked him. An official in Cúcuta, the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: [...] "I am sick and <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us." ...|$|E

500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: to husk a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type of work and he sold {{his interest in the}} threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at the card table.|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of fully digital recording in popular music. Katz and Fagen had previously experimented with digital recording for Gaucho, which ended up entirely analog. Nichols conducted experiments and found that the digital recordings sounded better than those recorded to magnetic tape. The Nightfly was recorded using 3M's 32-track and four-track recorders. Nichols built a new drum machine, the Wendel II—a sequel to the original Wendel, which was employed for their work on Gaucho. The new model was upgraded from 8 bits to 16 bits, and [...] "plugged straight into the 3M digital machines, so there was no degradation" [...] in sound. Problems with the technology persisted in the beginning, particularly regarding the alignment of the 3M machines. Representatives from 3M had to be called to align the machines, but eventually Fagen and Nichols grew <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> Nichols and engineers Jerry Garsszva and Wayne Yurgelun took classes at 3M's Minnesota headquarters, and returned knowing how to align the machines themselves. [...] "I was ready to transfer to analog and give it up on several occasions, but my engineering staff kept talking me into it," [...] Fagen remembered. They practiced an early form of [...] "comping" [...] Fagen's vocals—which they called [...] "beat the computer"—wherein he would record multiple takes and the engineers would pick the best lines from each take. On [...] "Walk Between Raindrops", they combined bass parts playing on a keyboard bass and bass guitar. Doubling bass lines would [...] "become common practice on many records," [...] according to writer James Sweet.|$|E
500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing they just said ' you,' because they were so <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E
