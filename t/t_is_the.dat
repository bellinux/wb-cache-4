25|$|With these definitions, the resolvent set of <b>T</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> set of all complex numbers ζ {{such that}} Rζ exists and is bounded. This set often is denoted as ρ(T). The {{spectrum}} of <b>T</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> set of all complex numbers ζ such that Rζ fails to exist or is unbounded. Often {{the spectrum of}} T is denoted by σ(T). The function Rζ for all ζ in ρ(T) (that is, wherever Rζ exists as a bounded operator) is called the resolvent of T. The spectrum of T is therefore the complement of the resolvent set of T in the complex plane. Every eigenvalue of T belongs to σ(T), but σ(T) may contain non-eigenvalues.|$|E
25|$|A {{more precise}} result {{is true for}} the C*-algebra of all bounded linear {{operators}} on a Hilbert space: If T is such an operator and ||T|| < 1nbsp&minus&nbsp&2/n for some integer n > 2, then <b>T</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mean of n unitary operators.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{economics}} {{has also}} been applied to intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different time. Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by George Ainslie's hyperbolic discounting—one of the prominently studied observations—and further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue, and Matthew Rabin. Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes {{in the near future}} more than for outcomes in the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1 when <b>t</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> near future, but high at time t when <b>t</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> present and time t+1 is the near future.|$|E
25|$|Blakley's {{scheme is}} less space-efficient than Shamir's; while Shamir's shares are each only {{as large as}} the {{original}} secret, Blakley's shares are t times larger, where <b>t</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> threshold number of players. Blakley's scheme can be tightened by adding restrictions on which planes are usable as shares. The resulting scheme is equivalent to Shamir's polynomial system.|$|E
25|$|In other dimensions, the {{constant}} B changes, {{but the same}} constant appears both in the t flow and in the coupling flow. The {{reason is that the}} derivative with respect to t of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the <b>t</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.|$|E
