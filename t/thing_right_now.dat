500|$|On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to {{a one-year}} contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played {{for by a}} {{position}} player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit [...]303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez. [...] "That's my biggest <b>thing</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> I'm {{trying to get a}} World Series ring", Lofton said on joining the Indians {{for the third time in}} his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, [...] "I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going." [...] In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a post-season home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 31 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, [...] "He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job." [...] As Rollie Fingers wrote, [...] "On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle." ...|$|E

Drawing on a number of narratological studies on the divided consciousness of homodiegetic narrative, Morini’s article applies the tools of deictic shift theory to a chapter of David Copperfield, and shows how many of Dickens’ comic effects and moralistic conclusions depend on various kinds of subtle shifts between the “I-narrator’s” and the “I-reflector’s” deictic planes...|$|R
