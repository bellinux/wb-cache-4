40|$|AbstractTwo {{iteration}} {{methods are}} proposed to solve real nonsymmetric positive definite Toeplitz systems of linear equations. These methods {{are based on}} Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (HSS) and accelerated Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (AHSS). By constructing an orthogonal matrix and using a similarity transformation, the real Toeplitz linear system {{is transformed into a}} generalized saddle point problem. Then <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods are established by applying the HSS and the AHSS iteration methods to the generalized saddle point problem. We discuss efficient implementations and demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods have better behavior than the HSS iteration method in terms of both computational complexity and convergence speed. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method outperforms the HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS iteration methods. <b>The</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method also converges unconditionally to the unique solution of the Toeplitz linear system. In addition, an upper bound for the contraction factor of <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method is derived. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method...|$|R

We provide numerical comparisons between <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> and unstructured condition numbers for the principal matrix logarithm and principal matrix square root of matrices in automorphism {{groups as well as}} for the map between matrices in automorphism groups and their polar decomposition.
