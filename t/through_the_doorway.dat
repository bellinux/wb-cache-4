25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Two guardsmen, Miomandre and Tardivet, each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} face down {{the crowd and}} were overpowered. [...] The violence boiled over into savagery as Tardivet's head was shorn off and raised aloft on a pike. As battering and screaming filled the halls around her, the queen ran barefoot with her ladies to the king's bedchamber and spent several agonizing minutes banging on its locked door, unheard above the din. In a close brush with death, they barely escaped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> in time.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} 1990 {{to select a}} single [...] "master image" [...] that summed up his film career, Spielberg chose the shot of Barry opening his living room door to see the blazing orange light from the UFO. [...] "That was {{beautiful}} but awful light, just like fire coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] very small, and it's a very large door, and there's a lot of promise or danger outside that door." [...] In 2007, Close Encounters was deemed [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" [...] by the United States Library of Congress, and {{was added to the}} National Film Registry for preservation. In American Film Institute polls, Close Encounters has been voted the 64th-greatest American film, the 31st-most thrilling, and the 58th-most inspiring. It was also nominated for the top 10 science fiction films in AFI's 10 Top 10 and the tenth-anniversary edition of the 100 Movies list. The score by John Williams was nominated for AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores.|$|E

500|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry. [...] The roof, {{which is made}} from slate, has a stone bellcote at the west end. Entrance is <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> on the south side, from the late 15th century; it has {{decorated}} surrounds and a square frame. There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation sit) and the chancel (where the altar is located) apart from a single step up into the chancel. The church is about [...] long by [...] wide. The east window, from the late 14th century, {{is set in a}} pointed arch with decorative edging. It has stained glass from 1916 depicting Christ crowning a knight with the words [...] "Well done thou good and faithful servant / Take unto you the whole armour of God." [...] There are two pairs of square-headed windows in the south wall, dating from the 17th century. On {{the north side of the}} church, a second entrance was blocked up in the late 19th century, and there is one pair of square-headed windows, also from the 17th century; there is also a small window at the west end of the church, from the 17th or 18th century. [...] The beams of the roof can be seen from inside the church. Behind the altar is a panelled reredos from the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was {{across the street at}} his residence. [...] Simonsen told the warden there was a {{disturbance}} inside the prison and that someone had been knifed. [...] Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the [...] "disturbance" [...] was. [...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower knew something was wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E
2500|$|With Arthur {{out on his}} mission, Lancelot and Guinevere {{decided to}} seek out the dagger themselves, by using Merlinâ€™s {{gauntlet}} that leads the two to a magical passageway that was located in the Vault of the Dark One. However, the passageway was also a deadly trap, as the Dark One emerges as pure darkness, and almost kills Lancelot, but he eventually survives, after Guinevere uses a torch to repel the Darkness. This would lead to a kiss between Lancelot and Guinevere. The two walk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and discover the Dagger, but couldn't grab it thanks to a protection spell placed on it by Rumplestiltskin, who in exchange for the gauntlet, offered the magical sands of Avalon, which can be used to fix anything that appears to be [...] "broken" [...] at their choosing. Unfortunately, despite Lancelot's warning not to accept it, Guinevere decided to accept the deal and goes back to Arthur. However, when she returns to Camelot, she is confronted by Arthur, who knew about her and Lancelot, and threw the enchanted sand of Avalon on her, making his wife obedient with whatever he wanted, and used more of the sand to create his Camelot empire.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts differ {{as to how}} Gordon was killed. According to one version, when Mahdist warriors {{broke into}} the governor's palace, Gordon came out in full uniform, and, after disdaining to fight, he was speared to death in {{defiance}} of the orders of the Mahdi, who had wanted him captured alive. In another version, Gordon was recognised by Mahdists while making for the Austrian consulate and shot dead in the street. The most detailed account of his death was given by his body servant Khaleel Aga Orphali when he was debriefed by English officers in 1898, after the reconquest by Kitchener. According to Orphali, Gordon died fighting on the stairs leading from {{the first floor of the}} west wing of the palace to ground level where the attackers stood. He got seriously wounded by a spear that hit him in the left shoulder. Together with Orphali, Gordon fought on with his pistol and sword and was hit by another spear. [...] "With his life's blood pouring from his breast [...] he fought his way step by step, kicking from his path the wounded and dead dervishes [...] and as he was passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> leading into the courtyard, another concealed dervish almost severed his right leg with a single blow." [...] Soon after that, Orphali was knocked unconscious and when he woke up several hours later he found Gordon's decapitated body near to him. Gordon's head was cut off and was brought to Omdurman, where it was shown to Rudolph von Slatin, one of the Mahdi's prisoners. After it was shown to Slatin, the head was brought to the Mahdi. According to some sources his body was dumped in the Nile. After the reconquest various attempts were made to locate Gordon's remains.|$|E
