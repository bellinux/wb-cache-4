5|$|Some of {{the accused}} Pendle witches, such as Alizon Device, seem to have {{genuinely}} believed in their guilt, but others protested <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> to the end. Jennet Preston {{was the first to}} be tried, at York Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is, {{like the}} rest of the Ace Attorney series, a cross between the {{adventure}} game and visual novel genres. The player's goal is to defend their clients in four cases, and prove <b>their</b> <b>innocence.</b> The gameplay is separated into two types of situations: Investigations and trials.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|In July 1840, a {{delegation}} headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt {{to save the}} Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that {{it was an act of}} justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} and tactics highlighted {{and increased the}} separation between the king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E

5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E
5|$|Because Pride and Prejudice was {{a period}} drama, the design {{required}} more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while {{trying to make the}} clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.|$|E

Appreciation of the [...] "wise guardians of the poor" [...] thus advertising their charity may not be wholly shared by Blake's [...] "Piper", the supposed narrator of the [...] "Songs of Innocence". In <b>their</b> state of <b>innocence,</b> children should not be regimented; rather, they should be playing blithely on the [...] "echoing green". The children in this poem [...] "assert and preserve <b>their</b> essential <b>innocence</b> not by going to church, but by freely and spontaneously, 'like a mighty wind,' raising to 'heaven the voice of song.|$|R

25|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was commercial: it encouraged viewers to keep watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting, as actors could not in any way telegraph or signal <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> or guilt.|$|E
25|$|When {{during the}} Question, {{the view of}} the chamber, the torture {{implements}} and the executioner did not cause the victim to confess, a full-scale torture session was planned. To prepare for torture, the victim was stripped naked with hands tied. The penultimate step to torture included a repetition of the questions asked earlier of the victims. If the victims still proclaimed <b>their</b> <b>innocence,</b> full torture was initiated.|$|E
50|$|Usually, crusading lawyers become {{involved}} in proving their cases (usually <b>their</b> client's <b>innocence</b> {{of the crime of}} which he is accused, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation which has covered up its malfeasance until this point) {{to such an extent that}} they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives.|$|R

25|$|Legal experts {{argued that}} a major {{obstacle}} to granting Davis a new trial was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, passed after the Oklahoma City bombing, which bars death row inmates from later presenting evidence they could have presented at trial. Members of the legal community have criticized the restricting effect of the 1996 Act {{on the ability of}} wrongfully convicted persons to prove <b>their</b> <b>innocence.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1981 Peter Weir film, Gallipoli {{is about}} a group of young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. They are sent to invade the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> about the war. The climax of the movie centers on the catastrophic AIF {{offensive}} known as the Battle of the Nek.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the guilty}} pleas, Darrow {{was criticized for}} using {{deception}} {{to raise money for}} his clients' defense: allowing supporters to believe in <b>their</b> <b>innocence,</b> in order to raise a war chest of $200,000 from contributions by working men, and spend about $100,000 of it to mount an expensive effort, while knowing all along that the McNamara brothers were guilty. Darrow said that his first duty was to his clients, and that he did whatever needed to raise the funds for the best defense possible.|$|E

25|$|The First Natchez War of 1716 was {{precipitated by}} Natchez raiders from White Apple murdering four French traders. Bienville, seeking {{to resolve the}} conflict, called a meeting of chiefs at the Grand Village of the Natchez. The {{assembled}} chiefs proclaimed <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> and implicated the war chiefs of White Apple. The Choctaw assisted the French in fighting the 1716 Natchez War. After the 1716 Natchez War, the French built Fort Rosalie near the Grand Village of the Natchez. The present-day city of Natchez, Mississippi developed from the 1716 establishment of Fort Rosalie.|$|E
25|$|The Witnesses' {{judicial}} process {{has also been}} criticized. Hearings take place in secret, with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor. According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but {{are not permitted to}} remain for the discussion. Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove <b>their</b> <b>innocence</b> and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 1974, two pubs were bombed in the Birmingham pub bombings (an act widely {{attributed}} to the IRA, but not claimed by them), which killed 21 civilians and injured 162. An inadequate warning was given for one bomb and no warning for the other. There were no military targets associated with either of the pubs. The Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, and the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the Guildford and Birmingham bombings, respectively, but each group protested <b>their</b> <b>innocence.</b> They were eventually released and pardoned after serving lengthy prison sentences, even though the Balcombe Street group had admitted responsibility long before.|$|E
5000|$|After escaping, Culpepper abducts Brian and restrains {{her with}} a straitjacket. He rides with his captive to the area with the gold.
