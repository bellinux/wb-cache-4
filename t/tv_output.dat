25|$|In April 2007, AMD {{announced}} {{the release of}} the M690T integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the M690E specifically for embedded applications which removed the <b>TV</b> <b>output,</b> which required Macrovision licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual TMDS outputs, enabling dual independent DVI interfaces.|$|E
25|$|Sony added <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> to the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can {{output in}} a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E
25|$|Stereo audio transmissions, {{using the}} NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 {{at some point}} in autumn 1987, to {{coincide}} with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC <b>TV</b> <b>output,</b> although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, ITV and Channel 4 had officially begun stereo transmissions using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in 1998.|$|E

50|$|Quality {{differences}} exist in SCART cables. While a proper SCART cable uses miniature coaxial cables for the video signals, cheap SCART cables often use plain wires for all signals, {{resulting in a}} loss of image quality and greatly reducing the maximum cable length. A common problem on a cheap SCART cable is that a <b>TV</b> <b>outputs</b> a composite video signal from its internal tuner and this is induced or cross-talked onto an incoming video signal due to inadequate or non-existent screening; the result is ghostly images or shimmering superimposed on the incoming signal. To non-destructively verify if a SCART cable uses coaxial cables, unscrew the strain relief at the SCART connector and fold open the plastic shell.|$|R

25|$|In February 1996, the {{electricity}} and heating {{were transferred to}} a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined heating, power and cooling unit. It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.|$|E

The project debuted at the Bergen International Festival in the same year. Also in 2015, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK introduced a series of new jingles by Röyksopp for the <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> of the NRK Nyheter news division, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the sub-brand. On 8 February 2016, Röyksopp announced that a new track titled [...] "Bounty Hunters" [...] would be included on the Star Wars Headspace compilation. The album was released on 19 February 2016.

This led to an intended series of 23 live show recordings being released, which dominated most of Psychic <b>TV's</b> <b>output</b> until 1988. In the event only 17 were released. Towards {{the end of this}} period Fergusson/P-Orridge completed their third proper studio album Allegory and Self: Thee Starlit Mire.

50|$|The {{output stages}} of both devices are similar, but the input stages are quite different. There is no {{baseband}} audio or video input to the translator. The translator receives an over-the air RF input signal {{by means of}} an antenna, just like a home receiver. Since received signal is already modulated {{there is no need for}} a modulator. Instead an input mixer or down-converter shifts the radio-frequency (RF) signal down to an intermediate-frequency (IF) signal. A second mixer (known as output mixer or up-converter) shifts the IF signal back up to the FM or <b>TV</b> band <b>output</b> signal frequency.|$|R

50|$|Between 1996 and 2009, {{the mast}} {{provided}} BBC One Wales and S4C {{to most of}} the town's residents. Its transmissions utilised spare UHF capacity in which to relay transmissions from the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station on low power (via another similar relay in nearby Bagillt). Due to limited capacity, it was not possible for the site to carry BBC Two Wales or ITV1 Wales. Owing to the constraints of local geography and location of the main Moel-y-Parc transmitter, residents in the town and some surrounding areas had previously been unable to fully access Welsh television output (provided in both the Welsh and English languages). Reception of the Welsh TV stations varied from poor to un-viewable and as a consequence programming was supplied almost exclusively by the North West of England-based TV stations such as ITV1 Granada, easily receivable with a set top aerial. As Flint falls outside the normal coverage area of these TV stations, reference in local programming was rarely ever made to the area. The relay was only installed following a campaign spearheaded by the Welsh-language group Teledu I Pawb (Television For All). The group considered the bias toward North West of England regional TV programming across many parts of the North Wales coastal strip unacceptable and detrimental to the preservation and promotion of the Welsh Language, culture and national identity. Similar relays were installed {{at the same time in}} the nearby Village of Bagillt and the Town of Holywell. The latter also transmits BBC Radio Cymru. It is estimated that the three relays have made available Welsh regional TV programming to some 24,000 to 30,000 residents. A number of nearby localities remained without any terrestrial access to Welsh <b>TV</b> and radio <b>output</b> including Mostyn and Fynnongroyw. Viewers (and listeners) in these areas (and indeed across the UK) were, however, able to pick up all the Welsh <b>TV</b> and radio <b>output</b> via Sky satellite.|$|R

Such models always had both the EGA and the <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> connectors operational, {{as well as the}} AY8910 sound chip. Domestic models often did not include either the <b>TV</b> <b>output</b> converter or the internal speaker or both. The AY8910 for the domestic models was sold separately as an external extension module, hanging off the same extension bus as the optional external disk drive.|$|E

50|$|The only {{requirement}} for a media server {{is a method}} of storing media and a network connection with enough bandwidth to allow access to that media. Depending on the uses and applications that it runs, a media server may require large amounts of RAM, or a powerful, multicore CPU. A RAID {{may be used to}} create a large amount of storage, though it is generally not necessary in a home media server to use a RAID that gives a performance increase because current home network transfer speeds are slower than that of most current hard drives. However, a RAID configuration may be used to prevent loss of the media files due to disk failure as well. Many Media servers also have the ability to capture the media. This is done with specialized hardware such as TV tuner cards. Analog TV tuner cards can capture video from analog broadcast <b>TV</b> and <b>output</b> from cable/satellite set top boxes. This analog video then needs to be encoded in digital format to be stored on the Media server. This encoding can be done with software running on the Media server computer or by hardware on the TV tuner card. Digital TV tuner cards take input from broadcast digital TV. In the USA, the ATSC standard is used. In {{most of the rest of}} the world, DVB-T is the accepted standard. Since these transmissions are already digital, they do not need to be encoded.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the behavior of}} the WFC 3 calibration system for the UVIS channel using data taken during SMOV.

The tungsten lamp shows a ∼ 10 % higher relative flux rate compared to <b>TV</b> 3, its <b>output</b> dropping at most a percent in most filters over ∼ 45 days. Ratios of the on-orbit to ground flats shows that the flats are stable with no obvious new features, though {{a small percentage of the}} droplets appear to have small subpixel shifts. The deuterium lamp shows a 3 - 8 % drop in the measured count-rates over the duration of SMOV. The deuterium ratios on-orbit to ground flatfields show small scale variations of a ∼ 2 % over the image attributed to contamination of the deuterium lamp surface. These features will limit the usefulness of the deuterium flats in generating difference flats for the calibration pipeline...|$|R
5000|$|Windowboxing (also called {{either the}} [...] "postage stamp effect", [...] "gutterboxing", or [...] "matchboxing") {{in the display}} of film or video occurs when the aspect ratio of the media is such that the {{letterbox}} effect and pillarbox effect occur simultaneously. Sometimes, by accident or design, a standard ratio image {{is presented in the}} central portion of a letterbox picture (or vice versa), resulting in a black border all around. It is generally disliked because it wastes much screen space and reduces the resolution of the original image. It can occur when a 16:9 film is set to 4:3 (letterbox), but then shown on a 16:9 <b>TV</b> or other <b>output</b> device. It can also occur in the opposite direction (4:3 to 16:9 to 4:3). Few films have been released with this aspect ratio - one example is The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which had numerous scenes with Steve & Terri Irwin using widescreen pillar boxing.|$|R
