5000|$|As Barry matured, the Bond scores {{became more}} lushly melodic (along with other scores of his such as Out of Africa), as in Moonraker (1979) and Octopussy (1983). Barrys score for A View to a Kill was traditional, but his {{collaboration}} with Duran Duran {{for the title}} song was contemporary and reached {{number one in the}} United States and number two in the UK Singles Chart. Both A View to a Kill and The Living Daylights theme by a-ha blended the pop music style of the bands with Barrys orchestration.

Jonny Greenwood later said: [...] "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after The Bends was released and it started appearing in peoples of polls {{for the end of the}} year. <b>Thats</b> <b>when</b> it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band."

Barrys film mix is heard on the soundtrack (and on A-has later greatest hits album Headlines and Deadlines). The version preferred by the band can be heard on the 1988 A-ha album Stay on These Roads. However, in 2006 Paul Waaktaar-Savoy complimented Barrys contributions: [...] "I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement. <b>Thats</b> <b>when</b> for me it started to sound like a Bond thing".

5000|$|In November 1973, guitarists Malcolm Young and Angus Young formed AC/DC and {{recruited}} bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans, and Colin Burgess, ex-Masters Apprentices drummer. [...] Soon the Young brothers {{decided that}} Evans {{was not a}} suitable frontman for the group; they felt he {{was more of a}} glam rocker like Gary Glitter. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, [...] "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl", with [...] "Rockin in the Parlour" [...] as the B-side. In September 1974, Ronald Belford [...] "Bon" [...] Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of producer George Young, replaced Dave Evans after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him. [...] The addition of Scott redefined the band; like the Young brothers, Scott had been born in Scotland before emigrating to Australia in his childhood, and loved rock and roll, especially Little Richard. Scott had played in the Valentines and Fraternity. In a 2010 interview with Mojos Sylvie Simmons, Angus Young recalled that Scott [...] "moulded the character of AC/DC...Everything became more down to earth and straight ahead. <b>Thats</b> <b>when</b> we became a band." ...|$|E

The G4 original television show Code Monkeys (2007) also references the bus in the first episode of the second season, where a character voiced by Tommy Chong tells the legend of Chester Hopperpot, a psychedelic pioneer who toured {{the country in a}} magical hippie bus called Farther. Ken Keseys quote [...] "Youre either on the bus or off the bus," [...] as quoted by Tom Wolfe, is often repeated as a counter-culture slogan.
