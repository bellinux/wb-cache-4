5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm. The main complaint raised {{was related to the}} delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage. In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> compete with monkeys and apes, {{as well as other}} mammals.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, Parker married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott. They {{struggled}} to survive through the Great Depression, working short cons and traveling the country seeking work.

25|$|In June 2012 {{a failure}} of an upgrade to payment {{processing}} software meant that a substantial proportion of customers could not transfer money to or from their accounts.

25|$|In early June 2013, {{during the}} close season, a Hearts media {{statement}} {{stated that they}} would need to raise £500,000 in capital to keep the club up and running during the break between seasons. With no match day income coming in and a lack of finance from owner Romanov, the club have been left in a position where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put their whole squad up for sale.|$|E
25|$|But in {{the state}} as a whole, only a small {{minority}} of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work to have their interests and children represented.|$|E
25|$|Liberia {{scored a}} 3.3 {{on a scale}} from 10 (highly clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index. This gave it a ranking 87th of 178 {{countries}} worldwide and 11th of 47 in Sub-Saharan Africa. This score represented a significant improvement since 2007, when the country scored 2.1 and ranked 150th of 180 countries. When dealing with public-facing government functionaries 89% of Liberians say <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay a bribe, the highest national percentage in the world according to the organization's 2010 Global Corruption Barometer.|$|E

However, the wells were also contaminated with naturally occurring {{high concentrations of}} poisonous arsenic, causing skin ailments and cancers. Awareness of the problem developed through the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Great Salt Lake Minerals Company (a {{subsidiary}} of Compass Minerals) which extracts minerals {{from the northern}} bay. The company potentially benefits from the higher salinity of the northwest arm of the lake but <b>has</b> <b>had</b> difficulties accessing water from the lake because of lower water level.

25|$|The hositility towards ThyssenKrupp {{reached a}} new level during the Kockums {{equipment}} repossession incident on 8 April 2014. As per protocol, two military trucks accompanied by armed soldiers entered the Kockums shipyard in Malmö to reclaim all materiel and equipment belonging to the Defence Materiel Administration (Sweden), FMV, {{as well as all}} secret blueprints and images. By orders from a manager, Kockums staff tried to sabotage the repossession by locking the gates with the repossession crew and escort still inside. According to a spokesperson from FMV {{this is the first time}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> forcefully repossess equipment.|$|E
25|$|Like the Commission, the Council of Ministers has, relatively, {{lost power}} due to Treaty of Lisbon. Its dynamic has also changed as member states {{have lost their}} veto {{in a number of}} areas. Consequently, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come up with {{stronger}} arguments faster in order to win a vote. The Presidency of the Council, which continues to rotate among Member States every 6 months, has lost influence: the Prime minister of the country in question no longer chairs the European Council, its foreign minister no longer represents the EU externally (that is now done by the High Representative).|$|E
25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V {{to be able to give}} an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E
50|$|Brazil won both {{of their}} first two matches convincingly, beating Sweden 7-1 and Spain 6-1 to go top of the group with four points going into the final match. With three points, Uruguay were close behind in second place, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come back from 2-1 down to draw 2-2 with Spain, before beating Sweden 3-2, the winning goal coming just five minutes {{before the end of}} the game.|$|R

25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

2500|$|The England {{team and}} the British press had been scathing {{about the quality of}} Australian umpiring in 1958-59, but 1962-63 was free of rancour, which {{reflected}} well on the umpires Colin Egar, Ted Wykes, Bill Smyth, Lou Rowan and Alan Mackley. Johnny Moyes wrote that [...] "The demeanour of the umpires has been splendid. They have been, but not too friendly. When <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> intervene they have done so firmly but not obtrusively. There have been mistakes, of course - there will always be mistakes - but general the standard of umpiring has been very pleasing." ...|$|E

The {{superintendent}} of the Cowes Fire Brigade {{said that it was}} the most serious fire that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> contend with for some years. He also said that there was some additional interest and honour lent to the occasion, as royalty were present for some considerable time watching the brigade at work. The bill that was presented by the Fire Brigade for attending the fire was put at £48 18s 6d.|$|R

50|$|Deimberg {{belonged to}} the Diocese of Mainz and lay within the parish of Herren-Sulzbach, later {{described}} as the Evangelical Parish of Herren-Sulzbach after the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves <b>had</b> introduced the Reformation into their domain in 1556. Until the Thirty Years' War, all the villagers were Evangelical. Later, however, other denominations were tolerated, though without gaining any special importance.

2500|$|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a {{cognitive}} disorder, which comes about after overcoming a traumatic event.

2500|$|The Yaquis are the {{indigenous}} group mostly {{closely associated with}} the state of Sonora. These people are second most numerous in the state with about 33,000 members traditionally located along the Yaqui River. They are found principally in the communities of Pótam, Huíviris, Torim, Cocorit, Bácum, Vícam, Rahúm and Belem, which have semi autonomous government. The Yaqui have been able to maintain most of their traditions including ancestor worship, original language, and many of their traditional rites and dances, with the deer dance the best known among outsiders. The Yaquis call themselves and the Mayos the “Yoreme” or [...] "Yoeme". The Yaqui and Mayo languages are mutually intelligible, and the two peoples are believed to have been united until relatively recently. One of the Yaqui religious celebrations which is best known among outsiders is Holy Week, along with rituals associated with Lent and Day of the Dead. As they consider the soul immortal, funerals are not a somber occasion but rather celebrations with banquets and music. The preservation of history is important to the Yaqui, especially the struggles <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> maintain their independence.|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} their 15th anniversary together, Boom Boom Satellites released their eighth studio album Embrace on January 9, 2013. For their first promotional single for the album, the duo recorded {{a cover of}} the Beatles' [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] as their first ever cover of any other artist. The Embrace 2013 tour had been planned to support the album {{as well as the}} group's 15th anniversary. However, in late December 2012 Kawashima was discovered to have symptoms of the early stages of a brain tumor, and the band cancelled all 23 shows scheduled from January to March 2013 to set aside for treatment and surgery; Nakano later revealed that Kawashima has had a history of brain tumor issues, {{but this was the first}} time that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cancel shows. The band decided that they would perform last few shows of December 2012, but had no plans to cancel the shows set for April and May 2013; the show in May was planned to be the band's first one-man live at the Nippon Budokan. On February 11, 2013, Nakano posted an update to the band's Facebook revealing that Kawashima had been discharged from the hospital and the two were writing and recording new songs. Following his recovery, the band announced that they were cancelling all but their Nippon Budokan show. This concert was later streamed live with 360 degree views on YouTube as part of YouTube Japan's Music Week as well as on Nico Nico Douga's live feature. In August 2013, they announced the concert would be released on an album due in November of that year, while also revealing that they were releasing Embrace internationally in September.|$|E
