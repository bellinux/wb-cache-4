Foster and his associates have secretly been recording and editing Penelope's speech to assemble a false transmission, which requests <b>that</b> <b>Jeff</b> dispatch Thunderbirds 1 and 2, with Brains on board, to El Hadim airfield where the Hood and his henchmen will be waiting to hi-jack the machines.

Ray Combs, then host of Family Feud, told jokes to insult Shawn Michaels prior to the bout and later served as guest commentator for the match. Michaels began the match by wrestling Bruce Hart. Although Michaels was able to go on the offensive against the Hart brothers, the knights were unable to achieve much success against the Harts. At one point, all four wrestlers brawled in the ring, but Owen was able to eliminate the Black Knight after performing a missile dropkick. Michaels and the knights regained control of the match, but Bret turned things around by eliminating the Red Knight via submission to the Sharpshooter. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury after being thrown out of the ring and sat out of the match for a few minutes. Meanwhile, Michaels provoked Stu Hart into punching him. Inside the ring, Owen forced the Blue Knight to submit to the Sharpshooter, which left Michaels by himself. While Bret was standing on the ring apron, however, Owen ran in to him and got distracted. This allowed Michaels to pin Owen and eliminate him from the match. Bret dominated the rest of the match against Michaels until Michaels walked back to the locker room. As a result, Michaels was counted out, and the Harts won the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and yelled at Bret, blaming Bret for causing him to be eliminated from the match.|$|E

The first HouseGuest to fill up their jar and claim the ball inside would be the winner of the competition. Kevin was the winner. Despite making a deal with him the previous week, Kevin and Natalie later made a plan to backdoor Jeff as they saw him as their biggest threat. Though this was his plan, Kevin and Natalie also debated taking out Michele, and thus feared <b>that</b> <b>Jeff</b> could win the Power of Veto and save Jordan if she were to be nominated; should Jeff use the Power of Veto on Jordan, it would force Kevin to nominate Natalie for eviction. On Day 55, Kevin chose to nominate Jeff and Michele for eviction. Later that day, Kevin discovered a secret room in the Head of Household bedroom known as Pandora's Box; upon entering the room, he discovered a box and learned that placing his hand inside the box would release $10,000 into the house. He did so, and became locked inside the box while the money fell into the backyard; the HouseGuests were able to keep the money, and {{were required to}} find a key to unlock Kevin from the room.

2500|$|From 2007 to 2011, the {{leadership}} of the FLDS Church was unclear. On November 20, 2007, after the conviction of then leader Warren Jeffs, attorneys for Jeffs released the following statement: [...] "Mr. Jeffs resigned as President of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Inc." [...] This statement does not address his position as prophet of the church, but merely addressed his resignation from his fiduciary post as president of the corporation belonging to the FLDS Church. According to a Salt Lake Tribune telephone transcript, there is evidence that, when incarcerated, Warren Jeffs made statements naming William E. Jessop, a former first counselor, as his successor or, alternatively, <b>that</b> <b>Jeffs</b> had told Jessop on January 24, 2007 <b>that</b> he (<b>Jeffs)</b> had never been the rightful leader of the FLDS. Many press accounts have suggested that Merril Jessop, who has been leading the Eldorado compound, is the de facto leader of the church. Additionally, on January 9, 2010 documents filed with the Utah Department of Commerce name Wendell L. Nielsen {{as the president of the}} sect. [...] The FLDS incorporation charter does not require the church president to be its prophet. However, traditionally the President of the FLDS church was also the religious head. [...] FLDS leaders have refused to clarify who is considered the prophet of the FLDS church. To add additional confusion to the issue of succession, a 2012 CNN documentary insists <b>that</b> <b>Jeffs</b> still leads the church from prison.|$|R
