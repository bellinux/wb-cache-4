5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians {{did not seem to}} follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder {{and when she was}} about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E

25|$|Form {{continued}} {{to be hard to}} find for the Phoenix though. Despite scoring significant numbers of goals, the Phoenix defence proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> watertight and high scoring games became a regular occurrence. Manchester closed the regular season on 23 April with a 6–2 away loss to the Hull Stingrays, finishing 7th in the EIHL. This was perceived by many fans to be somewhat of an underachievement by the organisation.|$|E
25|$|When the Lincoln Cent was {{introduced}} in 1909, {{it was discovered that}} the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the U.S. Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not unusual to see vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. Unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.|$|E

500|$|One critic, Matt Singer of indieWIRE, said in January 2013 {{that he has}} [...] "started to look at January with {{anticipation}} rather than dread." [...] He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have [...] "way too much money riding on [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> mediocre and boring," [...] January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. [...] "Why throw good money after bad?" [...] he asks rhetorically. [...] "Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck." [...] Such benign neglect, he suggests, led to The Devil Inside, [...] "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." [...] He likened January movies to trainwrecks, while bad movies in June were more like [...] "controlled demolitions." [...] Cloverfield, he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by The Grey and Mama.|$|E
500|$|For the PC version, GameSpot editor Stephen Poole stated [...] "You'll {{be better}} off looking for free online {{versions}} of the various games contained in Caesars Palace 2000". In contrast, IGN was more favorable to the PC version of the game. Francois Laramee of Allgame praised the game for its [...] "excellent audio-visuals. The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful. The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> distracting. The slot machine wheels are {{a bit on the}} small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game [...] "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired". ComputerAndVideoGames.com's Alex Huhtala criticized the game for its [...] "Poor, vomit-inducing presentation".|$|E
500|$|On July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, {{director}} of the Mayor's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley's patronage chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich's aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich's best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner {{was found guilty of}} lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family's home neighborhood and ward. [...] "I've never known them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> hard working, and I feel for them at this difficult time," [...] Daley said. [...] "It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed," [...] Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

2500|$|According to Nordlinger, one of MEMRI's early notable successes was its {{exposure}} of Muhammad al-Gamei'a.

[...] and that [...] " [...] are riding {{on the back of the}} world powers." [...] MEMRI's translation of Al-Gamei'a's interview was later cited by The New York Times, which hired two independent translators to confirm the MEMRI translation.
