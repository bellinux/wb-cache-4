50|$|There {{must be some}} act or some knowing {{omission}} on {{the part}} of the principal - if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{authorisation}} and {{the contract}} of mandate are distinct juristic acts, {{the rules that}} govern the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the agent’s <b>authority</b> to bind the principal {{are not necessarily the}} same as those governing the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the contractual relationship between the principal and agent. The contract of mandate may be terminated by any of the methods applicable to contracts generally: for example, by performance or by the mutual consent of the parties. An executory contract of mandate may, however, generally be terminated by the unilateral act of either party—revocation by the mandatory (principal) or renunciation by the mandatary (agent)—unless the express or implied terms of the contract dictate otherwise. This rule, which runs contrary to accepted contractual principles, is derived from the common law, where mandate was essentially a gratuitous contract. In modern law, the mandatary is usually remunerated for services rendered; in such cases, at least, it is doubtful whether the contract is freely terminable at either party’s will.|$|R
40|$|Blank Note This thesis {{deals with}} blank note (incomplete instrument) as a {{particular}} subset of promissory notes/bills of exchange. It {{is comprised of}} a brief introduction on history of securities followed by a summarization of development of prommisory note, including its legislative history in the Czech Republic.

A whole individual chapter investigates one of the crucial elements typical of incomplete instrument, which is authority to fill in empty spots as given by the signee to a holder. Thus, its goal is to illustrate its nature and the ways it can originate and terminate. It being the crucial issue of many litigations concerning a once incomplete promissory note, particular attention is given to <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> such <b>authority</b> while the largest part of this chapter looks at application of licence to fill in violation <b>of</b> the <b>authority</b> given.

The effect of his cruelties, {{and those of}} the Danes who acted under him, was, however, not to humble and subdue the Saxon spirit, but to awaken and arouse it. Plots and conspiracies began to be formed against him, and against the whole Danish party. Godwin himself began to meditate some decisive measures, when, suddenly, Hardicanute died. Godwin immediately took the field at the head of all his forces, and organized a general movement throughout the kingdom for calling Edward, Alfred's brother, to the throne. This insurrection was triumphantly successful. The Danish forces that undertook to resist it were driven to the northward. The leaders were slain or put to flight. A remnant of them escaped to the sea-shore, where they embarked on board such vessels as they could find, and left England forever; and this was the final <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the political <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the Danes over the realm of England--the consummation and end of Alfred's military labors and schemes, coming surely at last, though deferred for two centuries after his decease.|$|R

40|$|Since parental {{authority}} in South African law {{is based on}} German customary law, and not on Roman law, it exists {{for the protection of}} the child. Various protective measures exist to ensure that this goal is reached, mainly in the form of judicial interference with {{parental authority}}. An example is the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>authority,</b> or some <b>of</b> its incidents, by means of a court order. This takes place either in terms <b>of</b> the common-law <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> the High Court, or in terms of certain statutory provisions. One of the statutory provisions in terms of which the children's court can terminate some of the incidents <b>of</b> parental <b>authority,</b> is the Child Care Act 74 of 1983. If the children's court is of the opinion that a child is in need of care, it can order that the child be returned to the custody of its parents, or that the child be placed in foster care, or in a children's home or school of industries. There is at present no mechanism in the Child Care Act for ensuring legal representation for children. The draft Children's Bill expands the possible orders that the children's court can make and further provides that a child is entitled to legal representation in children's court proceedings, if necessary at state expense. In New Zealand, families participate in decision-making regarding children in need of care by means of the family group conference. In Scotland, children in need of compulsory measures of supervision are dealt with by a lay tribunal known as the children's hearing. The global movement to recognise and protect both the welfare and autonomy rights of children formed the basis of international-law protection of children, and the children's clause contained in section 28 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996. In order to ensure that the protective goal of child law is reached, I propose that a multidisciplinary lay tribunal be instituted in South Africa to deal with children in need of care, and that legal representation for children in children's court proceedings be made compulsory in certain circumstances.

40|$|Abstract. Innermost {{context-sensitive}} rewriting {{has been}} proved useful for modeling computations of programs of algebraic languages like Maude, OBJ, etc. Furthermore, innermost <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> rewriting is often easier to prove than termination.

This phenomenon has also been investigated for context-sensitive rewriting (CSR). Up to now, only few transformations have been proposed and used to prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> innermost CSR. In this paper, we investigate direct methods for proving <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> innermost CSR.
