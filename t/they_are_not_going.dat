5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies about why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob {{to watch what}} happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's {{what we were trying to}} explore here." ...|$|E

500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to budge, she stands {{up to them and}} says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he {{will not be able to}} protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of December 24, 2004 (three months after the crash of Flight 815), two members of a science team from the Kahana {{freighter}} anchored offshore—Daniel and Charlotte—who landed on the island three days earlier with a hidden agenda, sneak off to find the Tempest. [...] Juliet and the crash survivors' leader Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) notice their absence from the beach camp and pursue them. [...] After hearing the whispers, Harper approaches Juliet. [...] She tells her that Daniel and Charlotte intend to kill everyone on the island by deploying a lethal gas at the Tempest and that Ben's orders are for Juliet to kill them. [...] On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat suit at a computer. [...] After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma. [...] Jack arrives at the Tempest and Juliet explains that those on the freighter came to the island to wage war against Ben and she expects him to win. [...] She fears for Jack because Ben thinks that she belongs to him, but Jack shows no worry and kisses her.|$|E
500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm not going to get a call because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E

That's {{the stuff of}} a Saturday Night Live skit. I think any question that's insulting, presumptuous or bullying is totally off limits." [...] Crime reporter Art Harris suggests that such questions are not designed to elicit real answers: [...] "Usually you get no response.

On 26 September, President Donald Trump, during his meeting with Mariano Rajoy, said that [...] "Spain is a great country and it should remain united", but expressed his doubts on whether a referendum will be held, stating that [...] "I think that nobody knows if they are gonna have a vote. The President would say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to have a vote. But I {{think that the people}} would be very much opposed to that." [...] Earlier that month, the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert insisted in that the referendum is an internal affair of Spain and that the US [...] "will work with whatever government or entity that comes out of it".|$|E
2500|$|We've {{seen here}} at the city of Kent especially, {{probably}} the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups.

And these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They're worse than the brown shirts and the communist element and also the night riders and the vigilantes. They're the worst type of people that we harbor in America. Now I want to say this. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to take over [...] campus.

2500|$|As an {{isolated}} island, Isle Royale initially had neither wolves nor moose. The moose {{are believed to}} have either swam across Lake Superior from Minnesota in the early 1900s or were stocked on the island by man for the purpose of recreational hunting. [...] In 1949 a pair of wolves crossed an ice bridge from Ontario to the island during a harsh winter. But because only one pair of wolves migrated to the island, they have suffered from severe inbreeding. According to Rolf Peterson, a professor at Michigan Technological University and the lead wolf-moose researcher, [...] "Moose were isolated here 100 years ago. Most of the genes are still here, but they have enough population (to compensate). There are so few wolves that they have lost genetic variability. The scientific dogma suggests that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make it." [...] In fact, all of the wolves' DNA on Isle Royale {{can be traced back to}} one ancestor. [...] Inbreeding leads to mutations and fitness problems, often accompanied by violent social rejection by other wolves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial {{segment of the}} CanAm Highway. [...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route. [...] "The CanAm matters so little to Saskatchewan highway planners that they've turned the most southern part of it within the province -- the Highway 35 link from Weyburn to the little U.S. border crossing at Oungre -- to gravel. SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonorable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'. [...] "Brenda Bakken Lackey called Highway 35 an “embarrassment’’ and a hazard for truckers’ business since it {{was turned into a}} gravel roadway last year. [...] 'When it rains, there is mud and when it is dry, there is flying dust and gravel,' she said. 'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to put up with the mud that is coming across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' [...] " [...] "The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely {{especially when it comes to}} emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken." [...] The regional parks in this area are Nickle Lake, Mainprize, and Oungre Memorial as well as the Rafferty Reservoir.|$|E
2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E
