5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Cast members {{observed}} {{the staff at}} real hospitals in preparation for their roles. Stephenson and Griffin spent time at Watford Hospital, where they underwent {{a crash course in}} nursing basics, including handling bed pans and learning to make beds with hospital corners. Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, while French shadowed a consultant and registrar at Papworth Hospital, observing a heart bypass and lung biopsy procedure. Young explained that viewers believe in Casualty and trust the show <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and that he wanted Holby City to be the same in that regard.|$|E

5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis is meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> several {{symbolic}} interpretations {{have been put}} forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most}} common interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} the {{procession}} {{was connected to the}} marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Driving Emotion Type-S follows general {{conventions of}} racing games. The game's physics and controls intend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and {{are based on}} vehicular weight. The player competes in races with other computer-controlled cars in order to unlock new cars and tracks. Car settings can be customized, {{as well as their}} colors, before each course. The game includes 43 officially licensed cars from thirteen Japanese and European manufacturers, including BMW, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Porsche, Subaru, Mitsubishi, TVR, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, JGTC, and Lexus which was exclusive to the Western versions of the game. Fourteen courses are available in total, including two fictional circuit and real circuit like The Home of Formula One Circuit in Japan Suzuka Circuit and the home of Super Lap in Japan Tsukuba Circuit, and one exclusive to the Western versions of the game called West Coast.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, it was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, {{as opposed to the}} single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally {{nostalgic for}} the 'Bizarre' years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, she seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> {{and accepted the}} commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing {{that she could not}} recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E

25|$|Although not capped, Newham was {{severely}} affected by grant penalties. It {{had worked with}} the capped councils and decided to join the campaign: on 7 March the council members unanimously passed a motion declaring {{that they could not}} set a rate. Council deputy leader Alan Mattingly said that the majority of councillors would go to jail rather than cut services. It was soon clear that there was a significant split in the Labour group as Leader Jack Hart told a council meeting on 28 March that the Government would not increase their spending limit and urged members <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> His ally, councillor David Gilles, proposed a budget of £151.5m. Alan Mattingly by contrast urged the council to stand firm and despite Hart's support the budget was defeated by 18 to 35; a budget proposed by the SDP was voted down by 20 to 33.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by {{the creators}} of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of {{original}} character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), {{was part of a}} well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E
25|$|In April of {{his seventh}} year, Amenhotep {{was faced with}} a major {{rebellion}} in Syria by the vassal states of Naharin and dispatched his army to the Levant to suppress it. This rebellion was likely instigated by Egypt's chief Near Eastern rival, Mitanni. His stele of victory carved after this campaign records no major battles, which has been read a number of ways. It may be that this campaign was more similar to one of the tours of Syria which his father had fought, and he only engaged minor garrisons in battle and forced cities to swear allegiance to himoaths immediately broken after his departure. Alternatively, it appears that the two weeks when Amenhotep would have been closest to Mitanni are omitted from the stele, thus it is possible that his army was defeated on this campaign. Amenhotep's last campaign took place in his ninth year, however it apparently did not proceed farther north than the Sea of Galilee. According to the list of plunder from this campaign, Amenhotep took 101,128 slaves, which is an obviously exaggerated figure. Some of these slaves may have been recounted from the year 7 campaign, such as 15,070 citizens of Nukhash, since Amenhotep did not campaign anywhere near Nukhash on his year 9 campaign. However, even accounting for this recounting, the numbers still are too high <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and are probably just exaggerated.|$|E

500|$|Their {{goal for}} the episodes was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and {{focus more on the}} five members of the Simpson family and explore their {{feelings}} and emotions towards each other.

Season three was their basis for Homer: [...] "We liked Homer the way he was {{in the second and third}} seasons. That was what we consciously used as our model.

[...] The project was developed on a game engine compatible with Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The development team, led by Andersson as a creative director, produced concept art and 3D assets under art director Anders De Geer and Albihn.

When they took over the series they wanted many of the episodes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> ones that focused more on the five members of the Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other. They also wanted to produce a Treehouse of Horror episode, episodes about Sideshow Bob, Itchy & Scratchy and several [...] "format-bending" [...] episodes such as [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were [...] "old grizzled men with distinctive voices" [...] such as R.
