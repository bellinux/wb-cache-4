The Duskin were smaller than humans but bore a general resemblance to human shape, having the same number of limbs and being bipeds. Duskin dwelt beneath the surface of the earth, but in caverns much closer to the surface then their ancient rivals, the Reavers.|$|E
25|$|The Siberian {{population}} met the Decembrists {{with great}} hospitality. Natives played central roles in keeping {{lines of communication}} open among Decembrists, friends, and relatives. Most merchants and state employees were also sympathetic. To the masses, the Decembrist exiles were “generals who had refused to take the oath to Nicholas I.” <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> figures that had suffered political persecution for their loyalty to the people. On the whole, indigenous Siberian populations greatly respected the Decembrists, and were extremely hospitable in their reception of them.|$|E

The Radziwiłłs were a Polish Catholic family {{that belonged to the}} oldest and most renowned of dynasties in Poland, and were also in possession of much wealth. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> favorites with Louise's parents, and frequently dined at their home. As time went by, Louise and Antoni began to desire to marry. While many of her family members were in favor of such a match, her mother, never close with Louise, disapproved. Her parents eventually gave their full consent on the assurance that she would live near them during her marriage.|$|E

500|$|When {{the player}} talks {{to a number}} of {{characters}} in The Secret of Monkey Island, a close-up portrait of the character is shown. Elaine's appearance in this portrait was based on Avril Harrison, an artist working at LucasArts. Gilbert always felt bothered by these close-up portraits, stating that [...] "while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> art, I never felt they matched the style {{of the rest of the}} game". In the 2009 Special Edition, these close-ups were redone in the same stylized artwork featured in the rest of the game.|$|E
500|$|Around early 1809 Austen's brother Edward {{offered his}} mother and sisters a more settled life – {{the use of a}} large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna {{described}} the family's life in Chawton as [...] "a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaling {{cast her}} own mother and father, a doctor and an {{architect}} respectively, as the parents of her character. Kaling was proud of their acting, though she admitted that their presence on set was at first [...] "mortifying." [...] She commented, [...] "Of course I sort of lapsed back into that pre-teen attitude of every single thing my parents do embarrasses me. But <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> about it. They were such pros – they had all these scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it would be wonderful. But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Zoe and Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella) was a recurring storyline for both characters. In the British press, Kelly and Zoe {{were compared to}} two former popular characters, who also shared a close screen friendship, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). Kinsella has commented, [...] "It is nice to be compared because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> [...] but, hopefully, [...] and I will bring our own characters to light and show what we can do. We have so much in common and we balance each other out – when she's crazy I'll calm her down and vice-versa. It's worked well, which is why Kelly has been kept on, which is great for me but also for Michelle because she's got somebody to have fun with. Kelly's {{been one of the}} slowest developing characters and that's been good for me. I wasn't thrown into it and having Michelle has been great for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{autosomal}} and mitochondrial DNA {{tests have}} shown conclusively that the mummy {{is that of}} a female and that she was the mother of Tutankhamun. The results also show that she was a full-sister to her husband, the mummy from KV55, and that they were both the children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. There is speculation over the identity of the mummy from KV55 (sister marriage existed), with some Egyptologists, including Zahi Hawass, claiming the mummy is Akhenaten, and others, including anthropologist Joyce Filer, claiming the mummy as Smenkhare. This family relationship would lessen the possibility that the Younger Lady (and, by extension, Tutankhamun's mother) was either Nefertiti, or Akhenaten's secondary wife Kiya, because no known artifact accords either wife titles such as [...] "King's sister" [...] or [...] "King's Daughter". The possibility of the younger lady being Sitamun, Isis, or Henuttaneb is considered unlikely, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>Great</b> Royal Wives of their father Amenhotep III, and had Akhenaten married any of them, they would have taken the place of Nefertiti as the principal queen of Egypt. The report concludes that the mummy is likely to be Nebetah or Beketaten, daughters of Amenhotep III not known to have married their father, although he is known to have had eight daughters with Queen Tiye.
