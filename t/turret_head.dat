40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the model-based {{design of a}} fork control system in a <b>turret</b> <b>head</b> operated Very Narrow Aisle forklift in order to evaluate and push {{the limits of the}} current hardware architecture. The <b>turret</b> <b>head</b> movement consists of two separate motions, traversing and rotation, which both are hydraulically actuated. The plant is thoroughly modeled in the Mathworks softwares Simulink/Simscape to assist {{in the design of the}} control system. The control system is designed in Simulink/Stateflow and code-generated to be evaluated in the actual forklift. Optimal control theory is used to generate a minimum-jerk trajectory for auto-rotation, that is simultaneous traversing and rotation with the load kept in centre. The new control system is able to control the system within the positioning requirements of +/- 10 mm and +/- 9 mrad for traversing and rotation, respectively. It also shows good overall performance in terms of robustness since it has been tested and validated with different loads and on different versions of the forklift. However, the study also shows that the non-linearities of the system, especially in the hydraulic proportional valves, causes problems in a closed-loop control system. The work serves as a proof of concept for model-based development at the company since the development time of the new control system was significantly lower than for the original control system...|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of turning require power, in which the power {{obtained}} from electrical energy. The electrical energy is then converted into mechanical energy via an electric motor. How much power the electric motor is determined by several factors, among others: cutting speed, depth of cut, motion eating, cutting time and cutting tool material. In modern lathe used system {{is to make the}} gear head gear as the transmission power is driven by an electric motor. So that there is a relationship between the electric motor power on a lathe with head gear system to the cutting depth on a lathing process.

40|$|International audienceDesign {{problems}} {{constitute the}} first stage in developing a machining transfer line. This paper is concerned with a problem in which a transfer line has to be designed in an optimal way to produce parts of different types. Each part of a specific type requires {{a unique set of}} operations to be executed on the stations. Parts move along the stations in the same direction one after another in a given sequence, and a station is set up if at least one operation is executed on this station. Setup costs and times are part-type dependent. Each operation has its size, which is the number of standard tools required to perform this operation, and its processing time. Operations on the same part assigned to the same station are performed sequentially. Re-design, i. e., re-assignment of operations when switching from one type part to another is not allowed. Precedence relations are given on the superset of all operations. There is an upper bound on the total size of operations assigned to the same station, and an upper bound on the time that a part of a given type stays on the same station for all types. The primary objective is to minimize the number of stations. The secondary objective is to minimize the total setup cost. We establish computational complexity of various special cases of this problem, present constructive heuristic algorithms, integer linear programs as well as computational results. These results are applicable in designing transfer lines for mechanical parts manufacturing by multi-spindle <b>turret</b> <b>heads</b> in situations where the station costs are the primary concern and the station setup costs are the secondary concern of the designer...|$|R

The canister flew {{back up the}} chute and into Erwin's face, blinding him, searing off one ear and obliterating his nose.

Completely blind, he picked it up and feeling his way, crawled around the gun <b>turret</b> and <b>headed</b> for the copilot's window. His face and arms were covered with ignited phosphorus and his path was blocked by the navigator's folding table, hinged to the wall but down and locked. The navigator had left his table to make a sighting. Erwin couldn't release the table's latches with one hand, so he grabbed the white-hot bomb between his bare right arm and his ribcage. In the few seconds it took to raise the table, the phosphorus burned through his flesh to the bone. His body on fire, he stumbled into the cockpit, threw the bomb out the window and collapsed between the pilot's seats.|$|R

50|$|Stationary turret {{system has}} a {{relatively}} higher speed {{due to a}} series of identical heads rotating on a single turret. The feeder moves in the X direction to a fixed pickup location. As many as 36 vacuum nozzles {{around the perimeter of the}} rotating turret provide Z and theta alignment. <b>Turret</b> rotates multiple <b>heads</b> between pickup and placement locations. The PCB moves in X and Y direction under the rotating heads, pausing beneath the correct placement location. Comparing to a gantry head, the simultaneous movements of feeders and PCBs greatly improve the average placement rate. Because passive components do not demand a great placement accuracy, it is exclusively applied in chip shooters. Stationary turret system has a limitation of requiring large footprint for the moving feeder bank (footprint =2*total feeder length). The possibility of dislodging components due to the moving board mechanism is another limitation.|$|R

He {{was charged with}} the additional duty of dropping phosphoresce smoke bombs to aid in assembling the group when the launching point was reached. Upon entering the assembly area, aircraft fire and enemy fighter opposition was encountered. Among the phosphoresce bombs launched by S/Sgt. Erwin, 1 proved faulty, exploding in the launching chute, and shot back into {{the interior of the}} aircraft, striking him in the face. The burning phosphoresce obliterated his nose and completely blinded him. Smoke filled the plane, obscuring the vision of the pilot. S/Sgt. Erwin realized that the aircraft and crew would be lost if the burning bomb remained in the plane. Without regard for his own safety, he picked it up and feeling his way, instinctively, crawled around the gun <b>turret</b> and <b>headed</b> for the copilot's window. He found the navigator's table obstructing his passage. Grasping the burning bomb between his forearm and body, he unleashed the spring lock and raised the table. Struggling through the narrow passage he stumbled forward into the smoke-filled pilot's compartment. Groping with his burning hands, he located the window and threw the bomb out. Completely aflame, he fell back upon the floor. The smoke cleared, the pilot, at 300 feet, pulled the plane out of its dive. S/Sgt.

50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by {{the very nature of}} their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual <b>turret</b> lathes, indexing <b>heads</b> for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|R
2500|$|Despite Sorley's views, {{development}} of an upgraded rear turret for the Lancaster proceeded slowly. Harris became frustrated with the slow progress of the project, and {{did not believe that}} the Air Ministry would be able to produce the turret in time. As a result, he decided to go outside the official channels and personally asked the small Gainsborough firm of Rose Brothers to develop a turret for the Lancaster; this company had previously developed an improved gun mounting for the Handley Page Hampden bomber in 1940 upon a request from Harris. The Ministry of Aircraft Production subsequently offered to provide draughtsmen to help Rose Brothers develop the <b>turret,</b> but the <b>head</b> of the company turned down this offer and relied upon Air Vice Marshal Edward Rice for technical advice. Rice was one of the senior Bomber Command station commanders, and had travelled with Harris to visit Rose Brothers {{at the start of the}} project. He subsequently led No. 1 Group RAF. Harris obtained Sorley's agreement to support the {{development of}} what was by then known as the Rose turret in June 1943. However, Nash & Thompson, which produced the Lancaster's [...]303 turrets, was also commissioned to develop a [...]50 inch armed turret as the Air Ministry and Ministry of Aircraft production did not want to rely upon Rose Brothers alone.
