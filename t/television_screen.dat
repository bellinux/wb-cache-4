5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was {{begun in the}} 1960s at Northwestern University. They built a 24-inch telescope at Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico that could be repositioned under computer control. The telescope displayed a new galaxy each minute, with observers checking the view on a <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae {{over a period of}} two years.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white <b>television</b> <b>screen,</b> and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A button {{on the top of}} the right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and game boards much like a traditional board game. One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.|$|E

In Japan, Sega released the Mega Jet, a portable version of the Mega Drive designed for use on Japan Airlines flights.

5|$|This {{original}} {{version of the}} video begins at a hill where the band are playing in a quiet town. Then, the next scene passes through the band playing their instruments circling around and Chris Martin walking on the purple snow. At {{the end of the}} video, Martin falls to the snow and the final scene shows the band walking away from the town. This video is shown on a small on-stage <b>television</b> <b>screen</b> at live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses HΛL's remix version.

Several scenes portray the video being projected on a large <b>television</b> <b>screen,</b> with the ending chorus having a clone of Hamasaki walking into the club and observing herself performing on stage. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best.|$|E

The Chinese version of the film offers specially prepared bonus footage made exclusively for the Chinese audience. This version features a four-minute longer cut of the film, with a scene showing Dr. Wu on the phone with Iron Man visible on a <b>television</b> <b>screen</b> behind him, as well as a longer scene of Dr. Wu operating on Stark. The extra material also features product placement for various Chinese products.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard <b>television</b> <b>screen</b> {{displays}} {{an emergency}} message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

They also meet a young woman, Tessa, who says that Ruby had gotten pregnant and was planning to run away with her boyfriend, Greg Randall. The agents are unable to find Greg at the bar where he works; however, his boss tells them about UFO activity at Lake Okobogee.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain {{changes such as}} a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a <b>television</b> <b>screen</b> by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|The final Computer Space design uses no {{microprocessor}} or memory; {{the entire}} computer {{system is a}} state machine made of 74-series TTL chips, with graphic elements held in diode arrays. The array designs, which Bushnell designed to let him rotate the rocket in 16 directions with only 4 arrays, are {{laid out in the}} shape of the ships, which made it obvious to game operators what would need to be replaced if something broke. The ships themselves are projected on the screen as a pattern of dots, rather than connected lines, and the monitor they are projected on is a General Electric 15-inch black and white <b>television</b> <b>screen,</b> specially modified for the game. The rudimentary artificial intelligence constructed by Bushnell has the enemy ships firing towards the quadrant of the screen that the player's rocket is in, rather than a more complicated tracking algorithm.|$|E

5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the transitional period from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline {{involving}} Ric Flair, Michaels faced Flair in a Career Threatening {{match at}} WrestleMania XXIV, in which he won by performing Sweet Chin Music and thus ending Flair's career. Afterwards, Batista confronted Michaels about his actions at WrestleMania, calling him selfish and egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Jericho then confronted Michaels on this matter, in which Michaels admitted to faking the injury in order to defeat Batista. Michaels then defeated Jericho at Judgment Day. At One Night Stand, Michaels lost to Batista in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud. On the June 9 episode of Raw, Michaels was attacked by Chris Jericho during his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, being thrown directly through a <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> The following week, it was revealed that, {{within the context of}} the storyline, Michaels had suffered a detached retina. At The Great American Bash, a match between Michaels and Jericho was scheduled, in which Jericho assaulted Michaels' eye, which caused Jericho to win by referee stoppage.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E
