25|$|In {{order to}} select the correct power it is {{necessary}} to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted. This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in KW hours per tonne the weight of metal to be processed and the <b>time</b> <b>cycle.</b> Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other system losses need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and empirical formula. Modern techniques utilise finite element analysis and other computer aided modeling techniques, however as with all such methods a thorough working knowledge of the induction heating process is still required.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required <b>time</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Variations in {{equipment}} <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> {{can have a}} significant effect on the output of modern assembly lines. In an effort to identify and act accordingly when these variations occur, the development of a software application to analyse equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> via OPC is investigated in this project. Manufacturing organisations continuously seek improvements {{in equipment}} performance and output. A common improvement made is the reduction of equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> this provides an increase in output for a relatively small capital outlay. These improvements remain relatively unchecked and variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> due to numerous factors continue to influence equipment performance. An equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analyser can be used to monitor and report variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The resulting information can be used to predict equipment failures and allow maintenance departments to plan corrective actions. This analyser tool can also be used by engineering departments for analysing equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> during <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> improvement projects and new equipment installation. Currently the development of the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analyser system is at a stage where the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> of equipment can be monitored using OPC as a means of communication.
