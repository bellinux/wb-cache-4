40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the oribatid mites of Achipteriidae, {{one of the common}} {{families}} in Mongolia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East.</b> <b>The</b> family is represented by six and fourteen species in Mongolia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East,</b> respectively. In this work, we studied six recently collected species in detail, and their supplementary descriptions with precise illustrations are presented. We briefly discuss the species validity of Achipteria nitens (Nicolet, 1855), as well as the generic placement of Parachipteria nivalis (Hammer, 1952) and P. bella (Sellnick, 1928). Furthermore, we present data on habitat ecology, distribution and diversity of all achipteriid species in various areas of Mongolia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East,</b> and provide a key for the identification of hitherto recorded species in these regions. The majority of achipteriid species found in Mongolia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East</b> are known to be widely distributed in the vast areas of the northern hemisphere. Only three species have restricted distributions in <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East,</b> Siberia and Mongolia. Most species of Achipteriidae in Mongolia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> <b>East</b> are inhabitants of the litter of various forests, soils of grasslands or mosses growing on rocks or on forest floor; only two species seem to be arboreal inhabitants...|$|R
