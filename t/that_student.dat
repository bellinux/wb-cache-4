5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} {{that the right}} to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled.

5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say <b>that</b> <b>Student</b> was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from <b>that</b> <b>student.</b> Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} six key university {{teaching and}} learning processes using Checkland’s CATWOE mnemonic and the SIPOC model from lean operations theory.

The analysis also shows that instructors play a number of different roles in these self-same processes: as supplier, actor and customer.

The paper suggests <b>that</b> <b>students,</b> instructors and support staff must accept <b>that</b> <b>students</b> play a multiplicity of roles, sometimes simultaneously, in university {{teaching and learning}} processes.

30|$|As {{teachers}} frame conjecturing {{tasks as}} primarily about the resources <b>that</b> <b>students</b> use, {{we see that}} the operations <b>that</b> <b>students</b> use to make conjectures and the conjectures <b>that</b> <b>students</b> arrive at could be underspecified and undervalued in classrooms. As a result, ‘making conjectures’ could be seen as an ancillary activity. One way to increase the specificity and value of students’ work on conjecturing tasks would be to increase and broaden the role that conjecturing plays in complying with the didactical contract in geometry. This might begin with policy changes, such as the inclusion of Standards for Mathematical Practice in the Common Core State Standards for mathematics. Further, conjecturing, including the specific operations <b>that</b> <b>students</b> engage in and the conjectures that they produce, would need to appear prominently in artifacts that shape teachers’ vision of the curriculum, including textbooks and local and national assessments. This study speaks to the interplay between what students know and are able to do mathematically in classrooms and the impact that teachers’ perceptions of students’ work have on the mathematical opportunities <b>that</b> <b>students</b> have in classrooms.|$|R
