25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey {{specifically}} to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn't have time to get his full college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season. I think, because of those circumstances, he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gotten the credit he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{freshman}} season, Swanigan was {{one out of}} 162 underclassmen to enter their names for the 2016 NBA Draft. However, despite being one of 63 invitees for the NBA Draft Combine that year, he ultimately {{decided to return to}} college on May 25, which was also the new date set for players to withdraw their names from the draft and try again for another year. An NBA scout said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a chance if he can improve his jump shot and help defense. Big-time rebounder, works hard on his own. He's still more undersized center than power forward, though." ...|$|E

Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure to sort of find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The way he does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{cast members}} who appear in [...] "Acafellas" [...] are Stephen Tobolowsky as former glee club {{director}} Sandy Ryerson, Patrick Gallagher as football coach Ken Tanaka, Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, Kent Avenido as Sheets and Things employee Howard Bamboo, and Naya Rivera and Heather Morris as glee club members Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce. Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally {{supposed to play}} Dakota Stanley, but {{when he arrived in}} California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, [...] "a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, [...] "himself as this ignorant asshole". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just an amazing musical range. People like that who have been singing their whole lives, they have such a command of that." [...] Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode [...] "very emotional" [...] and [...] "one of [...] favorite scenes". Colfer described the scene as [...] "very respectful and very touching ... very, very real and serious." ...|$|E

500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has.</b> He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E
500|$|After Mitchell {{declared}} for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout {{told the}} Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, [...] "I don't think he's {{as fast as}} people in the press try to say he is. He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> nearly the explosion {{to be considered a}} first." [...] Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.|$|E
