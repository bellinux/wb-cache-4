40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a spin- 1 / 2 particle coupled to a nuclear spin bath through an isotropic Heisenberg interaction is studied, {{as a model}} for the spin decoherence in quantum dots. The time-dependent polarization of the central spin is calculated as a function of the bath-spin distribution and the polarizations of the initial bath state. For short times, the polarization of the central spin shows a gaussian decay, and at later times it revives displaying nonmonotonic time dependence. The decoherence time scale dep ends on moments of the bath-spin distribuition, and also on the polarization strengths in various bath-spin channels. The bath polarizations have a tendency to increase the decoherence time scale. The effective {{dynamics of}} the central spin polarization is shown <b>to</b> be <b>describ</b> ed by a master equation with non-markovian features.

40|$|During inter-eruption periods, magma {{pressurization}} yields {{subtle changes}} of the elastic properties of volcanic edifices. We use the reproducibility properties of the ambient seismic noise recorded on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano to measure relative seismic velocity variations of less than 0. 1 % with a temporal resolution of one day. Our results show that five studied volcanic eruptions were preceded by clearly detectable seismic velocity decreases within the zone of magma injection. These precursors reflect the edifice dilatation induced by magma pressurization and can be useful indicators to improve the forecasting of volcanic eruptions. Volcanoes {{are among the most}} dynamic geological objects and their eruptions provide a dramatic manifestation of the Earth’s internal activity. However, strong eruptions are only short 1 episodes in the history of volcanoes which remain quiescent most of time.

40|$|Over the years, {{modelling}} and {{simulation of}} anaerobic digestion {{has been developed}} as a pursuit for better understanding and operation of the process. As {{a response to the}} need for a generic model, the IWA Task Group for Mathematical Modelling of Anaerobic Digestion Processes published a Scientific and Technical Report describing the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1) (Batstone et al., 2002). The model provided many advantages for the scientific community, with the most essential feature being, the formation of a common framework for the simulation and study of anaerobic digestion processes. Since its publication the model has been extensively applied, analysed and expanded to represent a wide range of anaerobic systems. However, important limitations for the applicability of the model have been identified (Batstone et al., 2006; Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht, 2006). The use of a constant stoichiometry in ADM 1 makes the regulation of products from sugar fermentation {{one of the most important}} limitations when considering ADM 1 application for bio-hydrogen or other non methanogenic fermentations. Like many of the previously existing anaerobic digestion models, the ADM 1 is structured on a fixed-stoichiometry for all its embedded conversion processes. It is known however, that the product distribution changes as a function of environmental variables such as pH, products concentration, or the redox state of the system (Mosey, 1983).

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, researchers have studied the paths of transmission of HIV. An emergent path highlighted by Brief et al. (2004) follows a conceptual model of HIV infection which operates as follows: Individuals exposed to trauma develop depression and/or anxiety or other related mental disorder(s); they use alcohol and/or drugs to self-medicate or cope with unpleasant thoughts or feelings related to the trauma, which in turn impairs their judgment, thus increasing their engagement in HIV risk behaviors, and increasing their risk of contracting HIV. While studies have established trauma exposure, mental disorder and SUD as independently associated with HIV infection, there is a paucity of research examining the impact of trauma exposure and co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (COD). Galvan, Burnam and Bing (2003) concluded that population-based estimates of COD among HIV-positive people are not available in the literature.

The major snRNAs involved in pre-mRNA splicing (U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5, and U 6) occur together in nearly all loops of the lampbrush chromosomes, and in hundreds to thousands of small granules (1 - 4 /zm diameter) suspended in the nucleoplasm. The loops and granules also contain several antigens that are regularly associated with snRNAs or spliceosomes (the Sm antigen, U 1 - and U 2 -specific antigens, and the splicing factor SC 35).
