50|$|The {{concept of}} Tales bore {{out from the}} 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, {{according}} to <b>Telltale's</b> Steve Allison. <b>Telltale</b> and Gearbox had already worked together previously to bring Borderlands Claptrap robot to <b>Telltale's</b> Poker Night 2. Representatives from both <b>Telltale</b> and Gearbox were present at the ceremony at adjoining tables, and {{over the course of}} the event, the idea of combining their respective talents on a project came out. Following the ceremony, <b>Telltale</b> and Gearbox began to explore the possibilities, realizing that the Borderlands universe had a large number of characters with interesting stories that <b>Telltale</b> could build upon, as well as continuing to explore fan-favorite characters that the series had developed. Gearbox noted that with the three prior Borderlands games, they had created an interesting universe but as a first-person shooter, the player's interaction with characters in that world was limited, and saw the potential in having <b>Telltale</b> expand upon their universe in a meaningful manner.|$|R

He carefully observed each pitcher's idiosyncrasies, looking, he said, “for all the little quirks, details and tell‐tales.” He found that many pitchers concealed the ball poorly before delivery, allowing him to see their grip. Others telegraphed their curve balls by bending their wrists, or subtly altering their wind‐ups. “There are also facial <b>telltales.</b> I know pitchers who, when they throw a curve, bite the lip or stick out the tongue,” he said.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Lair of the Leviathan" [...] to {{be stronger}} than the previous chapters; on the review aggregator sites GameRankings and Metacritic, its Windows version holds the highest rating out of all Tales of Monkey Island episodes. The episodes puzzles were commended; IGNs Steve Butts opined that <b>Telltales</b> puzzle design had [...] "moved forward quite a bit", compared to both preceding chapters and their earlier Sam & Max games. One puzzle in particular, involving pirates holding a face-pulling contest, was praised by reviewers. Dickens described the chapters story as [...] "strong and advancing", and Ghiggino felt that it [...] "continued the fine Monkey Island tradition of being bizarre, hilarious and pretty interesting". Several reviews drew comparisons to the 1883 book The Adventures of Pinocchio, due to the games setting inside a giant manatee. The episodes writing received near unanimous praise, and response to the supporting cast was much improved over the preceding episodes; praise centered particularly around Murray, a demonic, disembodied skull. Criticism of [...] "Lair of the Leviathan" [...] primarily focused on the chapters brevity and lack of varied locations.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{believed}} that the first chapter, [...] "Launch of the Screaming Narwhal", was a respectable start to the game. Ryan Scott of GameSpy wrote that the puzzles [...] "generally challenge player just enough without becoming too frustrating", while Eurogamers Kristan Reed stated that their quality was [...] "bang-on time after time". However, criticism was directed toward certain puzzles designs—particularly toward that of one maze puzzle. The writing and story were lauded, with several reviews commending the dialogues humor. Adventure Gamers staff writer Evan Dickens felt that writing did not match up {{to the quality of}} LeChucks Revenge, however. Although the chapters supporting cast was considered weak, critics enjoyed the introduction of de Singe to the series. The voicework for the main characters was praised, as was Lands soundtrack. Critics were mostly complimentary toward the episodes graphics, with New Straits Times Bruno Chan and The Sunday Times David Phelan praising the updated interpretation of The Curse of Monkey Islands art style while 1UP.coms Bob Mackey called Guybrush [...] "the most convincingly expressive Telltale character yet"; however, concerns were voiced over erratic graphical quality between characters. The games controls were subject to reproof by a number of reviews; several preferred the keyboard controls over <b>Telltales</b> new [...] "click and drag" [...] system.|$|E

50|$|The first Poker Night {{game was}} {{developed}} by <b>Telltale</b> during a lull in their release schedule, and proved to be successful; Steve Allison, vice president of publishing at <b>Telltale,</b> believed it was the relationship between <b>Telltale</b> and the Valve Corporation {{that contributed to the}} success of the game, luring players with Team Fortress 2 items for performing well in the game.

5000|$|Critics gave {{positive}} reviews {{towards the}} overall gameplay mechanics, although they often presented some reservations. Several reviews praised {{the simplicity of}} the game interface. Andre Thomas of GamePlasma described the games learning curve as [...] "incredibly simple" [...] and the gameplay mechanics as logical extension of those from the adventure games of the 1990s, while GamingTrend reviewer Ron Burke praised <b>Telltales</b> [...] "intuitive" [...] point-and-click system. Mark Smith of Game Chronicles, however, stated that the streamlined mechanics eliminated [...] "a lot of the exploration and discovery we normally associate with these types of games". Some reviews directed criticism towards puzzle design; according to Smith, the game is [...] "certainly accessible to kids and younger teens", but the adult audience [...] "will find these games way too easy". Reviewing for Adventure Gamers, Evan Dickens felt that the puzzles took [...] "a bit of thought and consideration, but never to a point of consternation", believing that the low difficulty was intended by Telltale to allow players to [...] "proceed through the story with minimum frustration". Hypers Tim Henderson commends the game for being [...] "highly accessible and almost as funny as the original". However, he criticises it for its episodic content being a [...] "tease".|$|E
40|$|Rockbolting <b>telltales</b> are now {{an internationally}} {{established}} means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The dual height telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the rockbolted height, is the most widespread version. The dual height telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as rockbolting was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height <b>telltales</b> are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading dual height telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic <b>telltales</b> to be connected with a twin core cable and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection. In the latter configuration, a real time display of roof condition is obtained whilst retaining the immediate visual indication underground. A recent development is the “Autowarning” telltale. This provides a warning of impending goafing in depillaring operations via high visibility, flashing LEDs. The paper describes these and other telltale developments and provides case histories of their application worldwide, including UK, India, and USA...|$|E
