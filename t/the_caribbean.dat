5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw, only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix macaw (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> islands and from mainland South America to <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E
