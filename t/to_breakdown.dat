5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand is that he does what he wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> for almost five years.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in early 1966 to expand the group, {{resulting}} in the recruitment of Mark Landon (lead guitar) and Doug Rhodes (organ), previously a session musician for the Association. To reflect on the revamped line-up, Bonniwell changed the band's name to the Music Machine. [...] Another purpose for coining the name, Bonniwell explained, was [...] "I seguewayed [...] all the original material with musical segueways [...] [...] So we would be on stage for like an hour and ten minutes, wall-to-wall music just nonstop, which is why I called us the Music Machine". The band built a name for itself with its performances in local clubs in Los Angeles. [...] With Bonniwell as the de facto leader and creative force of the band, the Music Machine began to develop a blend of gritty 60s punk and psychedelia, and a repertoire encompassing Bonniwell's self-penned material along with some cover songs. The band's sound was highlighted by the authoritative and versatile vocals provided by Bonniwell, with an energized technique that juxtaposed the styles of Mick Jagger and Sky Saxon. Unlike these two contemporaries, Bonniwell possessed unusually good intonation in long-sustained passages, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> phrases {{into a series of}} slow pulsations. The Music Machine's artistic stance was also highlighted by Landon's wiry guitar playing, Olsen's reverberant bass, and Edgar's cymbal-punctuated drumming, which gave the band a harder-edged sound than many of their contemporaries.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1985 Summer CES, Nintendo {{returned}} with a stripped-down version of the AVS, having abandoned the home computer approach.

Renamed the [...] "Nintendo Entertainment System" [...] (NES), the new version lacked most of the upscale features added in the AVS, but retained many of its design elements, such as the grey color scheme and boxy design. In avoidance of an obvious video game connotation, NES replaced the top-loading cartridge slot of the Famicom with a front-loading chamber for software cartridges that place the inserted cartridge out of view. The revised design includes design flaws which have the side-effect of making the NES more prone <b>to</b> <b>breakdown.</b> The loading mechanism became notorious for slowly failing.

2500|$|Suppose {{the initial}} {{operating}} point D (...) at some rpm N. On decreasing the flow- rate at same rpm along the characteristic curve by partial {{closing of the}} valve, the pressure in the pipe increases which will be taken care by increase in input pressure at the compressor. Further increase in pressure till point P (surge point), compressor pressure will increase. Further moving towards left keeping rpm constant, pressure in pipe will increase but compressor pressure will decrease leading to back air-flow towards the compressor. Due to this back flow, pressure in pipe will decrease because this unequal pressure condition cannot stay {{for a long period}} of time. Though valve position is set for lower flow rate say point G but compressor will work according to normal stable operation point say E, so path E-F-P-G-E will be followed leading <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> of flow, hence pressure in the compressor falls further to point H (...)

2500|$|By March 1858, the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I) {{had reached}} Elgin and {{completed}} its junction with GNoSR at Keith on 18 August. The Morayshire Railway completed the 3½ miles of track from Orton station to Rothes and opened to passenger traffic on 23 August 1858—this allowed the Morayshire Railway to resurrect {{its plans to}} build a railway between Rothes and Craigellachie and this section was completed on 23 December 1858. It terminated, however, on {{the west bank of the}} River Spey so as not to incur the expense of a bridge.The Morayshire company would, under its agreement with the I, work its own trains on the Elgin [...] Orton section but without permission to stop for passengers. The engines used by the Morayshire Railway were small and prone <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> and unsuitable for the steeper gradients on this section of track—their use lasted only six weeks. The I blamed the Morayshire for causing delays in its own schedules and insisted on the Morayshire coaches being attached to its own and taken to Orton—relations between the two companies deteriorated rapidly and a dispute over charging for line use ensued. Matters came to a head when I held back the Morayshire Railway goods until the I goods were ready to be forwarded either to or from Orton. This caused difficulties with onward transmission of goods from and to Lossiemouth Harbour. Seemingly deliberate schemes were being devised to obstruct the Morayshire coaches from entering onto the I line. The two companies came to an agreement and the Morayshire Railway announced to its long suffering passengers that agreement had been reached and that delays should no longer happen.|$|E

Having undergone severe cosmetic surgery, Matt Clark (now played by Rick Hearst) returned to Genoa City under the fake identity 'Carter Mills' and began working at the coffeehouse where he schemed with Larry Warton (David [...] "Shark" [...] Fralick) to frame Nick for selling drugs. Matt became a [...] "beloved" [...] employee and Sharon invited {{him over to the}} ranch, where he attempted to drug and date rape her but failed. His plan to have Nick thrown in jail worked, and he lured Sharon to an isolated cabin where he nearly raped her until help showed up and he ran. Matt was driven off a cliff in a car driven by the unstable Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet). A dying Matt told Nick that he raped Sharon, and later pulled out his own ventilator and framed Nick for his death; Nick was arrested again but eventually freed. Sharon became pregnant and Nick believed it was Matt's child, and wanted her to give it up for adoption. They argued, causing Sharon to fall and give birth to a stillborn baby-girl which was later confirmed through DNA testing to be, in fact, Nick's child.

2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for Operation Overlord, Resistance attacks on the rail system increased with the Resistance {{in the first three}} months of 1944 damaging 808 locomotives compared to 387 damaged by air attack. Starting with the clearer weather in the spring, between April–June 1944 the Resistance damaged 292 locomotives compared to 1, 437 damaged in air strikes. These statistics do not completely tell the story as Resistance sabotage attacks on the rail system in the first half of 1944 were so pervasive that the Germans had to import workers from the Reich Bahn (the German state railroad) and put soldiers on trains as they no longer trusted the Cheminots. On 23 March 1944, General Pierre Koenig was appointed commander of the FFI and flew [...] to London from Algiers to co-ordinate the operations of the FFI at the SHEAF commanded by General Dwight Eisenhower at a section known as État Major des Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur (General Staff, French Forces of the Interior). The American and British officers at SHEAF distrusted the Resistance with the OSS agent William J. Casey writing that many in the Resistance appeared more interested in post-war politics than in fighting the Germans. Despite the mistrust, SHEAF planned to use the Resistance to tie down German forces. In April 1944, there were 331 drops of weapons by the SOE to the marquis, in May 531 drops and in June 866 drops. The most common weapon provided by the SOE was the Sten machine gun, which through inaccurate except at short ranges and prone <b>to</b> <b>breakdown</b> was cheap, light, easy to assemble and disassemble and required no special skills to use. Other weapons dropped by the SOE were the Webley revolver, the Bren machine gun, the Lee-Enfield rifle and the PIAT anti-tank gun while the OSS provided the M3 [...] "Greasegun", the Browning handgun, the M1 rifle and the Bazooka anti-tank gun. In general, American weaponry was preferred to British weaponry, through the British-built Bren gun emerged as one of the favorite weapons of the resistance. Reflecting the importance of weapons, organising supply drops was the main concern for the Resistance in the spring of 1944. André Hue, a dual citizen of France and the United Kingdom serving in the SOE who parachuted into Brittany to lead the Hillbilly resistance circuit recalled his principle duty in the spring of 1944 was organizing supply drops and attempting to avoid the Wehrmacht and the Milice. Hue had been born in Wales to a French father and a Welsh mother, and like many other Anglo-French dual citizens had volunteered for the SOE. The Communist FTP often complained that they were being staved of arms by the BCRA with Charles Tillon noting that the BCRA had organized hundreds of supply drops, of which only six were for the FTP. On 29 April 1944, the most famous of all the SOE agents during the war returned to France when Nancy Wake, aka the [...] "White Mouse" [...] parachuted into France. Despite the rampant sexism in French society (French women were not allowed to vote until 1946 as Frenchwomen were viewed as minors under the protection of their father or husband), Wake took command of a marquis band numbering about 1, 000 men in the Auvergne region and led it successfully, barking out orders in her distinctive Australian accented French and threatening to shoot any man who a problem with taking orders from a woman. A sign of Wake's success as a guerrilla leader was the number of maquisards under her command increased to about 7, 500 by the summer of 1944.|$|E
