5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|For the 2001–02 season, McGrady {{averaged}} 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, {{earning his}} second All-NBA Team selection, {{this time to}} the All-NBA First Team. During that year's All-Star Game, he completed {{one of the most}} memorable highlights of his career, throwing the ball off the backboard <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> completing an alley-oop in traffic. At season's end, the Magic were again ousted in the first round of the playoffs, losing in four games to the Charlotte Hornets.|$|E

However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E

5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through allusions <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>and,</b> occasionally, {{the narratives}} discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E

5|$|The group {{traveled}} to Italy in early 1818. They first surrendered Allegra to Byron in April, much to Claire's distress. In August, Percy Shelley took Claire to see Allegra, at her request. Percy arrived in Venice, telling Byron {{he had the}} entire family. Mary was thus summoned to Venice to substantiate Percy's story. However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child in Naples <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents really were.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's {{actions were}} {{motivated}} by several factors, which led him to regard Peter as a threat <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, {{even if it had}} failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert de Clare {{was the son}} of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester – {{known as}} Gilbert 'the Red' – who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, {{daughter}} of EdwardI. As a condition for the marriage, the earl had to surrender all his lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his wife for the lifetime of either. This grant was made on the condition that the lands would pass to the couple's joint heirs, but if they were childless to Joan's heirs from any later marriages. The younger Gilbert was born the next year, around 10May 1291, securing the inheritance for the de Clare family, but his father died only four years later, on 7December 1295, while the boy was still a minor. Because of the joint enfeoffment, Joan kept the custody of the family lands, and did homage to the king on 20January the next year.|$|E

5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant. He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2016.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October Michael won {{a decisive}} {{victory against the}} army of prince-cardinal Andrew Báthory at the Battle of Şelimbăr, giving him control of Transylvania. As he retreated from the battle, Andrew Báthory was killed by anti-Báthory Székely on 3 November near Sândominic and Michael gave him a princely burial in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Alba Iulia. With his enemy dead, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia and {{received}} {{the keys to the}} fortress from Bishop Demeter Naprágyi, later depicted as a seminal event in Romanian historiography. Historian István Szamosközy, keeper of the Archives at the time, recorded the event in great detail. He also wrote that two days before the Diet met on 10 October, Transylvanian nobles elected Michael the voivode as Prince of Transylvania. As the Diet was assembled, Michael demanded that the estates swear loyalty to Emperor Rudolf, then <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> thirdly to his son. Even if he was recognized by the Transylvanian diet as only imperial governor subject to the Holy Roman Emperor, he was nonetheless ruler of Transylvania.|$|E

5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power {{at the expense of}} the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Northcott as Chief of the General Staff and Blamey as Commander-in-Chief bore some similarities {{to the one}} between the RAAF's Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, {{the commander of the}} RAAF forces in the field, but Blamey was senior to Northcott, both in rank and in the Army's command structure. The relationship could still have been a delicate one, but in the event it was characterised by none of the rancour and rivalry that marred the wartime administration of the RAAF. In late 1943, Blamey sought to appoint Northcott as his deputy, but the government turned down his request, on the advice of General Douglas MacArthur, who did not want another officer who was answerable both <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the Australian Government. However, when Blamey travelled to Washington, D.C. and London in April 1944, he arranged for Northcott to act as Commander-in-Chief in his absence. After Wynter's death in February 1945, the post of LGA was abolished and the CGS again became responsible for administration.|$|E
