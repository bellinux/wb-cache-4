5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to stop herself, although she has enough control <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, Conroy {{settled at}} his {{family home in}} Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded the Montgomery Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his {{pensions}} and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing. She was moved to admit that Conroy had swindled her {{while at the same}} time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit. A rapprochement followed between mother and daughter.|$|E

5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John would talk to him about Maya for hours at a time. However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E

5|$|There were {{continuing}} {{disputes with}} the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission {{was appointed to}} settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post {{he was reluctant to}} accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.|$|E
25|$|The {{photographer}} Ella E. McBride assisted Curtis in {{his studio}} beginning in 1907 and became {{a friend of the}} family.

60|$|Silently {{and sadly}} she wore {{through the rest}} of the day, unmolested by any remark from the rest of the family, but absorbed in her own thoughts, and the night passed in acute mental distress; with longings after Violet to soothe <b>her,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hopes of the good and right way of peace.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1906, salvage efforts were {{suspended}} for the year, with plans to resume them in 1907. However, an inspection of the ship conducted from 1 to 10 October 1906 found that the action of the sea was driving her further ashore and bending and warping her hull so that her seams were beginning <b>to</b> <b>open,</b> <b>her</b> deck planking was coming apart, and her boat davits had collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Bichier {{opened her}} heart to Fournet. She shared her longing to {{dedicate}} herself to God. He, for his own part, had seen first hand the situation of his rural congregants, who had lost all resources for education in the turmoil of the Revolution. He asked her <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> home for the catechesis of the local children. Elizabeth asked the permission of her mother, who agreed to this project and a small school slowly began to develop at La Guimetière.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the {{literary}} salon in the Arab world, of which little is known, dates back far longer than one would expect. Sukayna bint Husayn (735 / 743), began running her salon centuries during the Umayyad dynasty, well before the idea was first introduced to seventeenth century Europe. She was a highly regarded woman of great intelligence, and an expert in fashion and literature. She {{was the first woman}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> house to male and female guests, and organised evenings of music, literary criticism and poetry.|$|E
25|$|The ninth series {{began on}} 7 May 2013, {{and saw the}} format of the task layout reverted to its {{original}} approach prior to the seventh series, though with the final task amended to focus on the investment prize, in which the finalists of the process had to conduct a presentation of their business idea to a panel of experts, including branding, an advert, and answering any questions given about their proposal. The series was won by Leah Totton, who used her prize <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> first cosmetic skin clinic on 22 January 2014.|$|E

25|$|Princesa {{was brought}} into Portsmouth on 8 May 1740. An Admiralty order of 21 April 1741 {{authorised}} her purchase, and this was duly done on 14 July 1741 for the sum of £5,418.11.6¾d. After a great repair she was fitted at Portsmouth between July 1741 and March 1742, for a total sum of £36,007.2.10d. Her spirited resistance to three ships of equal rating attracted much comment. A contemporary description noted that she was larger than any British first rate and carried unusually large guns, many of them brass. She was described as the finest ship in the Spanish Navy, with her high build allowing her <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> lower gunports in conditions in which her opponents could not. The Admiralty finally had the ammunition to rouse Parliament from its complacency and fund a series of increases in British warship dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Nick, Dalton, Paige and Blake {{realize they}} will not arrive at the game in time and return. Nick and Dalton arrive in Ambrose to find Carly and Wade.

When she tries to gain Nick's attention, Bo cuts off the tip of Carly's finger, but she uses the blood from her finger <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> glued lips apart and screams for help. Nick fends off Bo and frees Carly. Meanwhile, Dalton finds Wade, who is still alive but unable to move because of the wax. Attempting to peel off the wax, Dalton realizes that he is unintentionally removing Wade's skin in the process. Vincent finds Dalton and slashes Wade's face with a machete, killing him. After a chase through the museum, Vincent catches Dalton and beheads him. Meanwhile, Nick and Carly realize {{that all of the}} town's inhabitants are real people covered in wax and that Bo and Vincent have been luring people in and covering them in wax to make the figures look more realistic.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E

She was thus suddenly deprived of her protector in France, but almost {{at the same time the}} marriage of Margaret of Anjou seemed <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the means of returning to England.|$|R
