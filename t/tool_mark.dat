Already the men were going, when the same strange instinct which had drawn him to the spot caused {{him to take a}} spade from one of them and begin to shovel away the sand {{from the face of the}} cliff--for here, for some unexplained reason, were no boulders or debris. Seeing their master, to whom they were attached, at work, they began to work too, and for twenty minutes or more dug on cheerfully enough, just to humour him, since all were sure that here there was no tomb. At length Smith ordered them to desist, for, although now they were six feet down, the rock remained of the same virgin character.|$|E

40|$|In {{forensic}} science, {{evaluation of}} marks plays {{an essential part}} in proving connections between different offences. Striation marks, caused by a grinding or dragging motion of a tool, form an important class of marks. The forensically relevant striation marks on firearm bullets belong to this category as well as numerous kinds of <b>tool</b> <b>marks,</b> which can be caused e. g. by screwdrivers, knives, or pliers. The subject of this dissertation is the computerized evaluation of such <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> by applying methods of automated visual inspection. The methodology described opens characteristic individual marks to computerized processing and hence paves the way for automated comparison of marks. In this context, specific properties of <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> are taken into consideration: In contrast to marks on bullets, curved grooves are frequently found that require a groove straightening {{on the basis of}} adequate signal models. Moreover, many <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> show gaps in their groove structure thus demanding reliable segmentation of the groove area. Finally, the mostly uncertain orientation of the marks requires an extension of usual comparison algorithms. Using these evaluation strategies, an automated comparison method for <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> on the basis of correlation techniques has been realized. Experimental results substantiate the performance and the suitability for practical application of the developed identification system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the results of}} a study on the <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> originated during the excavation of eight hypogeal prehistoric graves of Sardinia dating back between the first stages of IV millennium BC and the end of III millennium BC. The analysis were performed by a traditional survey and a 3 D photogrammetric technique. The results allowed to identify the morpho-metric characters of the <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> and the typological features of the stone picks used in the excavation of the graves during the different phases of Sardinian prehistory. The morphological and dimensional variability of the <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> across time, can be considered as an useful tool to track the technological evolution of the picks used for the excavation of the neolithic and eneolithic hypogeal tombs of Sardinia...|$|R
40|$|AnSTRACT: In ancient storm-influenced prograding {{shoreline}} sequences, ole <b>marks</b> (mainly <b>tool</b> <b>marks)</b> from hummocky cross-stratified storm deposits {{are commonly}} oriented normal to paleoshoreline and {{the trend of}} paleobathymetric contours in the basin. Asymmetrical <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> typically indicate flows directed offshore. Several workers have attributed their formation to storm-generated, shallow marine turbidity currents. This interpretation conflicts with observations from modem shelves, where storm-driven circulation generally is geostrophically balanced, and time-averaged bottom currents approximately parallel bathymetric contours and the local shoreline. The resolution of these apparently conflicting observations {{may lie in the}} realization that <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> (and many other small paleoflow indicators) form almost instantly as the result of instantaneous flow conditions very near the bed. Beneath storm-generated flows in the shallow ocean, instantaneous and time-averaged characteristics of the bottom boundary layer generally exhibit little similarity. Storm-generated <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> are formed by the movement of large tools within the thin (less than 1 m) inner boundary layer resulting from the superimposition f waves and currents. The orientation of the peak instantaneous shear stress moving large tools under such combined flows mainly reflects wave-orbital motions, which typically are normal to shore. The magnitude of stress is greatly increased in the offshore direction (and decreased in the onshore direction) by superimposition f a steady current with an offshore component of flow, but the direction of stress is only slightly affected. In ancient storm-influenced sequences, therefore, shore-normal <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> generally were not formed by turbidity currents; rather...|$|R

40|$|In {{forensic}} anthropology {{the analysis}} of microscopic <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> found in skeletal sharp force trauma is a challenging area. Many different imaging methods have been employed to measure cut mark characteristics in aid of developing diagnostic tools for estimating knife type used for these marks. Furthermore numerous experimental methods for creating <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> for analysis have been used. A novel method for creating, analysing and presenting <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> using reverse engineering and metrology was investigated. 5 Pig torsos prepared to mimic human anatomy were stabbed using seven different knives. Following chemical defleshing the ribs were micro-CT scanned for {{the analysis of}} <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> left from the knives. Other methods including SEM, Digital microscopy and Laser scanning were also considered. Various geometrical measurements of the cut mark micro-morphology were taken. These measurements were statistically analysed using SPSS. Knife types gave statistically significant different cut mark width, length, wall angle, floor radius and shape (p< 0. 001). Knife sub-types and individual knives also gave statistically significant differencing in width and shape (p< 0. 001). Statistical classification of cut marks as either serrated or non-serrated made marks was shown to be 90 % if width, length, wall angle and floor radius were accounted for. This indicated that determining knife type quantitatively is possible and could aid criminal investigators with their enquires. 3 D models of these cut marks could also be developed for potential use in court for forensic expert testimony...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} determined if {{the patterns}} resulting from different chainsaw chain types impacting bone leave <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> are dissimilar enough {{from one another}} to determine which type of chainsaw was used in dismemberment mimicking homicide cases. Multiple styles of commercially available chainsaw chains were used. The long bones of adult white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were cut to produce false start cuts and complete sectioning to mimic typical human dismemberment. The cut areas were examined macroscopically and microscopically to note features common to each chain. The chains were compared to one another to note differences. It was proposed that each chainsaw would leave different <b>tool</b> <b>marks.</b> It {{was found that the}} style of tooth significantly affects the size of the exit chipping, size of the breakaway notch, angling of the kerf floor, and the mass of bone wastage produced. The most significant differences were produced with a standard tooth. The skip of the chainsaw did not create significant differences.
