5|$|Merchants {{engaged in}} a {{multitude}} of private trades and industries. A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits, such as animal breeding, farming, manufacturing, trade, and money-lending. Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron, since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties {{worth as much as}} ten million cash. In the early Western Han period, powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes to evaporate brine to make salt, or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and casted iron implements. To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists, Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE {{and for the first time}} drafted former merchants with <b>technical</b> <b>know-how</b> such as Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) to head these government monopolies. However, by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron. Even before this, the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies, since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy. However, the usurper Wang Mang (r. 923 CE) did employ some merchants as low-level officials with a salary-rank of 600 bushels. Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor, which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE, yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again (with alcohol taxes reinstalled). The official Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) started a brewery business to help pay for his father's costly funeral, an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar. Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry.|$|E

Due {{to increase in}} unplanned urbanization, industrialization, geometric progression of population growth, change in pattern of agriculture, lack of proper <b>technical</b> <b>know-how’s</b> and non-implementation of appropriate technology at river Basin level, insufficient supply of pure and fresh water has been observed in recent years. Moreover, irrigation is major consumer of water in India {{in addition to the}} water demand for industrial processing and urban day by day due to increasing economic activities. It is essential for the policy makers to work out the optimum demand of water for different purposes from available water resources.

40|$|The {{research}} on KPIs has undergone substantial developments {{for the past}} few decades. Different users of KPIs often define the KPIs from different perspectives. Generally speaking, KPIs are quantifiable variables that indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the performances of a product, a system, or personnel. Managers may use them to evaluate the performance of their team members in order to keep them on the right track; employees can use them to monitor his/her own performances and adjust accordingly; customers can use them to select their ideal products. This thesis focuses on developing KPIs for a department. Currently, the methodologies of developing KPIs for a department are very limited. The dominate methodologies in both the research and practical world are Business Scorecards and Six Sigma. Both of them define the performance measurements from a high business level instead of providing much <b>technical</b> <b>know-hows.</b> Also, neither of them has addressed on how to prioritize the performance measurements. This thesis work proposes a new framework to systematically develop KPIs for a department utilizing Environment-Based-Design (EBD) methodology by treating “Designing KPIs for a department” as a design problem. A case study of applying the proposed framework on an engineering department of an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) project in {{the oil and gas industry}} is also included in this thesis...|$|R

2500|$|For most of {{its history}} in the modern era, the Israeli wine {{industry}} was based predominantly on the production of Kosher wines which were exported worldwide to Jewish communities. The quality of these wines were varied, with many being produced from high-yielding vineyards that valued quantity over quality. Many of these wines were also somewhat sweet. In the late 1960s, Carmel Winery was the first Israeli winery to make a dry table wine. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that the industry at large saw a revival in quality winemaking, when an influx of winemaking talent from Australia, California and France brought modern technology and <b>technical</b> <b>know-how</b> to the growing Israeli wine industry.

2500|$|As {{early as}} the 14th century, Basque whalemen may have made [...] "seasonal trips" [...] to {{southern}} Ireland and the English Channel – where they undoubtedly targeted right whales. These regions became particularly well-known {{to them by the}} 16th century. By {{the first decade of the}} 17th century, Basque whaling had reached Brazil, not on its own initiative, but on that of the colonial government. With imports of whale oil from the Basque region and Cape Verde not meeting the demands of the expanding colonial sugar industry, they saw a solution in the humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that inhabited their coastal waters. Lacking the <b>technical</b> <b>know-how</b> to hunt them, they sought help abroad. In 1602, two Basque whalers accompanied Diogo Botelho, the newly appointed governor general of Brazil, to the colonial capital of Bahia de Todos os Santos. It was their crews that introduced commercial whaling to colonial Brazil. Each year for nearly a decade Basque ships made runs from Biscay to Brazil, where the oil they produced supplied sugar mills (engenhos) with a dependable source of fuel for nocturnal grinding, as well as oil for lubricating machinery and caulking boats and ships. This ended in 1610, when one of the Basque captains tried to smuggle Brazilwood out of the country. He was discovered and imprisoned – as were his men. The same year the crown declared whaling to be a royal monopoly.|$|E
