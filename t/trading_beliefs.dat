40|$|We study asset pricing {{dynamics}} in artificial financial markets model. The financial market is populated with agents following two heterogeneous <b>trading</b> <b>beliefs,</b> {{the technical and}} the fundamental prediction rules. Agents switch between trading rules {{with respect to their}} past performance. The agents are loss averse over asset price fluctuations. Loss aversion behaviour depends on the past performance of the trading strategies in terms of an evolutionary fitness measure. We propose a novel application of the prospect theory to agent-based modelling, and by simulation, the effect of evolutionary fitness measure on adaptive belief system is investigated. For comparison, we study pricing dynamics of a financial market populated with chartists perceive losses and gains symmetrically. One of our contributions is validating the agent-based models using real financial data of the Egyptian Stock Exchange. We find that our framework can explain important stylized facts in financial time series, such as random walk price behaviour, bubbles and crashes, fat-tailed return distributions, power-law tails in the distribution of returns, excess volatility, volatility clustering, the absence of autocorrelation in raw returns, and the power-law autocorrelations in absolute returns. In addition to this, we find that loss aversion improves market quality and market stability...|$|E

5000|$|As Mito thought {{developed}} during the 19th century, the scholars began to emphasize anti-Western sentiment {{and the importance of}} the emperor in Japanese society. In particular, Mito scholars embraced the political slogan [...] "sonnō jōi" [...] which means [...] "Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians". The scholar Aizawa Seishisai was the first advocate of this philosophy in Japan. In 1825, he wrote New Proposals, which presented his ideas about the need to protect Japan from the Western 'barbarians'. He promoted nativism and opposition to Western force, <b>trade,</b> and <b>belief</b> systems. He was particularly a fierce opponent of Christianity, which in his view undermined Japanese values. [...] Seishisai likewise advocated support of the emperor as a method of confronting the Western threat from abroad. [...] In the work, Seishisai also advanced the idea of kokutai ("national essence") which combined Confucian morals, Shinto myths, and other philosophies. According to Seishisai, the Japanese imperial family were direct descendants of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, so Japan was supposed to establish the proper standard for other nations to emulate. [...] New Proposals served as an inspiration for Japanese nationalists throughout the 19th century leading up to the Meiji Restoration-1869.|$|R

While {{the vast majority of}} the empirical literature supports this view, recent research questions these findings by also considering the reciprocal relationship between trade and conflict. If conflict also influences trade, then trade is an endogenous right-hand side regressor and previous estimates which ignore this are inconsistent.

40|$|We {{explore a}} model of the {{interaction}} between banks and outside investors in which the ability of banks to issue inside money (short-term liabilities believed to be convertible into currency at par) can generate a collapse in asset prices and widespread bank insolvency. The banks and investors share a common belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have different objective functions; changes to this common belief result in portfolio adjustments and <b>trade.</b> Positive <b>belief</b> shocks induce banks to buy risky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing new short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets in order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and they supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple market-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of equilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe), causing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent. Successive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel; rather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their initial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the expansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can also force larger price declines. Emergency asset price supports can be understood as attempts by a centra...|$|R

We argue that the dual objects of the Associations, adherence to a uniform price and the operation of a central auction, provided different levels of incentives to firms to co‐operate in each centre. Firms took calculated rational decisions whether to co‐operate with respect to ‘price’, and different behaviours between centres depended heavily on structural and environmental situations.

40|$|Despite {{interest}} in the influence of religion on economic activity by early economists like Adam Smith, modern economists have done little research on the subject. In light of the apparent religious fervour {{in many parts of}} the global economy, economists' seeming lack of {{interest in}} studying how religious cultures enhance or retard the globalization of economic activity is especially surprising. In general, trade theories have given less weight towards the reason for trade explanation on demand side. As a contrary to H-O theory Linder had proposed a theoretically sound and empirically consistent trade theory with a new claim for the reasons why countries trade on the demand side. To fill this gap, I use international survey data on religiosity for a broad panel of countries trading with US to investigate the effects of church attendance and religious <b>beliefs</b> on <b>trade.</b> The <b>beliefs</b> are, in turn, the principal output of the religion sector, and the believer alignment to a specific denomination measures the inputs to this sector. Hence, I used an extended gravity model of international trade to control for a variety of factors that determine trade, and I used two regression methods, OLS and WLS, to exploit the model to its fullest. I find that the sharing of same religious cultures by people in different countries has a significantly positive influence on bilateral trade, all other things being equal. These results accord with a perspective in which religious beliefs influence individual traits that enhance trade and economic performance in general. And my attempt to magnify religion as a means to trade is only a derivation of Linder’s overlapping demand theory...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} facts about the tragedy of September 11 is that the perpetrators were willing to die for their cause. It is this apparent readiness to sacrifice oneself, {{perhaps more than any other}} fact, which makes the threat of terrorism so large and so incomprehensible. Perhaps more than anything else, this marks off “them” from “us” as most of us cannot imagine ourselves committing any such act. In this paper, I argue that it is possible to explain such acts in rational choice terms, and that, while such acts are indeed extreme, they are merely an extreme example of a general class of behavior in which all of us engage. One reason such acts are committed is to obtain “solidarity” (or social cohesion or “belonging-ness). ” Solidarity is typically acquired through group-directed activity, especially in gangs, cults, unions, political parties or movements, and religious sects. I analyse the production of solidarity as a <b>trade</b> involving <b>beliefs</b> [...] the individual adopts the beliefs sanctioned by the group and receives the benefit of social cohesion in exchange. I construct a simple formal model to illustrate this process, and then develop the conditions under which rational suicide is possible. The paper thus combines work on social interactions and religion, and therefore is most closely related to work by Sacerdote and Glaeser (2001), who argue that religious behaviour is often motivated by the desire for social interaction, and provide a great deal of evidence that this is an important motive behind religious attendance. The paper is therefore generally related to work on social interactions and social capital, (especially Akerlof (1991 and 2000) Becker (1996),and Putnam (2000)), conformity (e. g., Bernheim (1994)), and to the economics of religion (Iannaccone (1992, 1998), Raskovich (1996),Sacerdote and Glaeser (2001)) as well as the economics of terrorism (Sandler (e. g., 2002)) ...|$|R

Myths of Herakles (Etruscan Hercle) were the most common theme and the battles of this demi-god hero against evil foes may have elicited a connection with Etruscan conceptions of funerary iconography/death and the afterlife. As Herakles went to the Underworld and returned, essentially defeating death, he became a symbol of hope for the afterlife.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to understand the trading strategy that would allow an investor {{to take advantage of}} “excessive” stock price volatility and “sentiment” fluctuations. We construct a general equilibrium model of sentiment. In it, there are two classes of agents and stock prices are excessively volatile because one class is overconfident about a public signal. As a result, this class of irrational agents changes its expectations too often, sometimes being excessively optimistic, sometimes being excessively pessimistic. We determine and analyze the trading strategy of the rational investors who are not overconfident about the signal. We find that because irrational traders introduce an additional source of risk, rational investors reduce the proportion of wealth invested into equity except when they are extremely optimistic about future growth. Moreover, their optimal portfolio strategy is based not just on a current price divergence but also on a model of irrational behavior and a prediction concerning the speed of convergence. Thus, the portfolio strategy includes a protection in case there is a deviation from that prediction. We find that long maturity bonds are an essential accompaniment of equity investment, as they serve to hedge this “sentiment risk. ” Even though rational investors find it beneficial to <b>trade</b> on their <b>belief</b> that the market is excessively volatile, {{the answer to the question}} posed in the title is: “There is little that rational investors can do optimally to exploit, and hence, eliminate excessive volatility, except in the very long run. ”Bayesian behavior, irrational behavior, financial-market equilibrium, excess volatility, risk premia, noise traders, survival. ...|$|R

I examine {{the question whether}} a disagreement based speculative trade can persist in {{an environment in which}} agents are learning. The speculative trade is understood as an equilibrium outcome, in which agents who buy the asset pay higher price for it, than {{they would be willing to}} had they not had the opportunity to re-trade it in the future. The corresponding notion of speculative bubble, which is analyzed in Essay 2, is understood as an excess of the equilibrium price over the current market fundamental. Harrison and Kreps (QJE 1978) provide an example of a persistent speculative trade. The agents start with different prior beliefs, which are concentrated on disjoint sets. This prevents them from learning. The resulting permanent disagreement leads to a speculative bubble, which is independent on any observed history of data. I extend this example by adding learning. In Essay 1, I set up a general equilibrium model of <b>trading</b> with differential <b>beliefs</b> and learning. The dividend process follows a general hidden Markov process. Using recursive techniques I develop tools to compute and analyze equilibria in this environment. I also provide conditions under which a speculative trade arises. In Essay 2, I apply those techniques to analyze the dynamics of a speculative bubble in a very special case of a Markov dividend process and the prior beliefs concentrated on two transition matrices. Those matrices represent two possible theories considered by agents. Agents put positive probabilities on both theories, hence they are learning. The resulting speculative bubble arises whenever the data does not convincingly favor any of the theories used by agents. I give conditions for the data generating process to lead to persistent speculative bubble. I also show that even though the speculative bubble reappears infinitely often it also happens very rarely on a typical sample path. In fact, the average time in between the periods of high bubble is infinity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 Non-market economies (or Communist countries) are {{subjected}} to unusually high levels of Western trade protection. Why do non-market economy exports face higher levels of trade protection than other country groups, including other developing countries? Why have patterns of trade protection against non-market economies remained largely unchanged in the post-Cold War period despite several formal trade rule changes designed to facilitate access to U. S. and European markets? Why have the U. S. and European Union improved the fairness and transparency of their trade laws, yet both have failed to apply the changes to actual trade with non-market economies? This dissertation analyzes the trade impediments that former Communist countries face integrating into the international political economy. Traditional international and comparative political economy explanations for trade protection are tested and refuted as explanations for trade discrimination against non-market economies. Instead, a theory of belief stasis and belief change is developed to account for patterns of trade discrimination. Longstanding cognitive beliefs about the country of origin {{play an important role}} in explaining patterns of <b>trade</b> protection. Rational <b>beliefs,</b> developed during the Cold War about the particularly threatening nature of trade with non-market economies, continue to affect the application of trade policies. A variable new to economic theories is introduced [...] -belief certainty. This variable explains the dynamic of both belief stasis and belief change. Beliefs function as information discounters, varying in their discounting effects according to the certainty with which they are held. Deriving belief certainty from the trade related institutional incentives faced by a country, this project shows how degree of belief certainty affects decision-making by Western trade agencies. Thinking about beliefs in terms of the certainty with which a belief is held allows for an explanation of both why and how <b>beliefs</b> affect <b>trade</b> policy-making. It provides a consistent explanation for seemingly contradictory trade policies enacted by the West toward non-market economies. The United States and European Union's treatment of non-market economies in the area of anti-dumping trade policy is analyzed in order to provide empirical support for the argument...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Multinational {{enterprises}} (MNEs) {{are central}} drivers behind neo-liberal globalisation. These enterprises are usually centred in developed countries, with competitive operations in developing countries. The literature on MNEs and {{foreign direct investment}} usually focus on the motivation for investment, decisions on expansion, the structure of ownership of investment, the mode of entry, {{and the perception of}} risk. Fluctuation in the exchange rate is a source of uncertainty that affects MNEs' and other enterprises' market values. Enterprises' exposure to changes in the exchange rate has increased with the adoption of floating exchange rates and more intensive involvement in international <b>trade.</b> The conventional <b>belief</b> is that competition in the export market is positively related to a depreciation of the exchange rate, which will in turn be advantageous to the stock market, while the opposite is true for an appreciation of the exchange rate. If the contribution of import or intermediate imported inputs to the final production were quite large, an appreciation of the exchange rate will {{have a positive effect on}} input costs and the stock market. This study investigates the exchange rate exposure of multinational enterprises in South Africa to the bilateral exchange rate of the rand against the US dollar and the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand. It presents evidence on the direction and magnitude of currency exposure. From the empirical results presented in this study it can be concluded that the majority of MNEs are not significantly exposed to either one of the exchange rate changes. It has also been found that the majority of enterprises lose market value when their local currency depreciate against the US dollar, while the majority of South African enterprises are positively related to changes in the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand. MNEs that are not significantly exposed to changes in exchange rates could be subject to three possibilities. (1) The most obvious reason is that enterprises are not exposed to changes in the exchange rate. Enterprises in liberated (or •open") countries are more exposed to exchange rate movements as opposed to those in closed countries, such as the USA.
