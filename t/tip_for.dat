25|$|A further {{external}} {{issue that}} affected development was {{the failure of}} the Telecommunications Research Establishment to produce the intended radar bombing system for the aircraft in a timely fashion; this required a redesign in 1947, changing the aircraft's nose to accommodate a glazed <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> visual bombing by a bomb aimer, which in turn required the cockpit to be restructured to facilitate the ejection system of the additional crewmember. In 1948, the design team relocated to Warton Aerodrome, Lancashire; establishing a flight test organisation and assembly facilities there.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other early}} paravians, Anchiornis had large wings {{made up of}} pennaceous {{feathers}} attached to the arm and hand. The wing of Anchiornis was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. The primary feathers in Anchiornis were {{about as long as}} the secondaries, and formed a rounded wing. The wing feathers had curved but symmetrical central quills, with small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poor aerodynamic ability. In the related dinosaurs Microraptor and Archaeopteryx, the longest wing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear relatively long and pointed. However, in Anchiornis, the longest wing feathers were those nearest the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon auxin distribution is apical dominance, {{which means the}} auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to construct a}} New Town {{was taken by the}} city fathers, after overcrowding inside the Old Town city walls reached breaking point and to prevent an exodus of wealthy citizens from the city to London. The Age of Enlightenment had arrived in Edinburgh, and the outdated city fabric did not suit the professional and merchant classes who lived there. Lord Provost George Drummond succeeded in extending the boundary of the Royal Burgh to encompass the fields {{to the north of the}} Nor Loch, the heavily polluted body of water which occupied the valley immediately north of the city. A scheme to drain the Loch was put into action, although the process was not fully completed until 1817. Crossing points were built to access the new land; the North Bridge in 1772, and the Earthen Mound, which began as a <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> material excavated during construction of the New Town. The Mound, as it is known today, reached its present proportions in the 1830s.|$|E
25|$|The M1070F {{replaced}} the Scammell Commander as the British army tank transporter in 2001. Before {{the development of}} the M1070A1 for the U.S. Army, the more powerful M1070E model was developed as a possible Technology Insertion Programme (<b>TIP)</b> <b>for</b> the M1070A0 fleet. The M1070E1 was offered to meet the British Army's requirement for a tank transporter but was not selected. The vehicle selected by the British Army is the 1070F model, a much-revised M1070E1. The UK fleet, which when delivered was made up of 92 tractor trucks, 89 King GTS 110/7 semi-trailers, and three Tru-Hitch recovery systems, were delivered as part of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) award to FASTTRAX in 2001 that included staff to operate the vehicles as Sponsored Reserves. The contract award included a 28-system option that was not exercised. It was disclosed in late-2009 that Broshuis of Holland had been selected to supply 20 heavy-duty 45,000kg payload full-width two-axle trailers for use with the 1070F in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|Although North American beavers are superficially {{similar to}} the European beaver (Castor fiber), several {{important}} differences exist between the two species. North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at {{the middle of the}} snout for the former, and in the <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European race, which is triangular. The foramen magnum is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European. The anal glands of the North American beaver are smaller and thick-walled with a small internal volume compared to that of the European species. Finally, the guard hairs of the North American beaver have a shorter hollow medulla at their tips. Fur color is also different. Overall, 50% of North American beavers have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish, while in European beavers, 66% have pale brown or beige fur, 20% are reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{is present}} in Bloodborne as well, though it {{functions}} differently from its counterparts in the Souls series. By activating a non-consumable item {{at the cost of}} one Insight point, players can summon other players into their world to help with boss battles or large groups of enemies, and progress through areas of the game cooperatively. This leaves the player vulnerable to invasions, in which another player may invade the victim's game world and attempt to kill them, unless the player can find and defeat a specific enemy before an enemy player invades. Multiplayer summons are limited by proximity; players can only be summoned within a specific distance of each other to prevent players being summoned too far away to be of any assistance. Players can only summon other players that are around the same level as them to prevent the game from being too difficult, or too easy, for one of the players. What Covenant a player is a part of affects multiplayer as well. Players can summon an NPC to help them in addition to getting help from other players. The NPC serves as an AI companion to the player, that helps defeat enemies. Players can only summon specific NPCs that they have met throughout their journey. Another way players may interact with each other is by leaving notes. A player may leave a <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> defeating a boss, tell the reader where to go, fool the reader by purposely providing incorrect information, or just leave a meaningless message to others. Players may rate a message as 'Fine' or 'Foul', which will indicate to future readers whether the note is useful or untrustworthy.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{clitoris}} {{exists in}} all mammal species, few detailed {{studies of the}} anatomy of the clitoris in non-humans exist. The clitoris is especially developed in fossas, apes, lemurs, and, like the penis, often contains a small bone, the os clitoridis. The clitoris exists in turtles, ostriches, crocodiles, and in species of birds in which the male counterpart has a penis. The clitoris erects in squirrel monkeys during dominance displays, which indirectly influences the squirrel monkeys' reproductive success. [...] In female galagos (bush babies), the clitoris is long and pendulous with a urethra extending through the <b>tip</b> <b>for</b> urination. Some intersex female bears mate and give birth through {{the tip of the}} clitoris; these species are grizzly bears, brown bears, American black bears and polar bears.
