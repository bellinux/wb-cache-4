The assistant fire chief and fire chief of the Wellington Fire Department gave conflicting statements on whether the unavailability of the Wellington water tower, which had been emptied while it was being repainted, had hampered efforts to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for three hours, with hot spots still smoldering the following day. No injuries were reported. The fire caused $2 million in damages.

5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and <b>travel</b> <b>information</b> on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Here, {{we examine}} the effects of traffic {{information}} provision on driver behaviour. While many previous studies have evaluated the effect of traffic information provision using hypothetical traffic conditions, here we evaluate measures using actual observed link traffic volume. A dynamic path-flow estimation model was used to obtain time-dependent path traffic volumes, and the estimates were contrasted with provided real <b>travel</b> time <b>information.</b> The results show that <b>travel</b> time <b>information</b> provision has a big effect on route-choice behaviour. Furthermore, parameters of a logit model were estimated, and the validity of the model was investigated. The effect of <b>travel</b> time <b>information</b> on driver behaviour was found to be statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|In the {{expressway}} network, detectors {{are installed}} on the links for detecting the <b>travel</b> time <b>information</b> while the predicted travel time can be provided by the route guidance system (RGS). The speed detector density can be determined to influence flow distributions {{in such a way}} that the precision of the <b>travel</b> time <b>information</b> and the social cost of the speed detectors are optimized, provided that each driver chooses the minimum perceived travel time path in response to the predicted <b>travel</b> time <b>information.</b> In this paper, a bilevel programming model is proposed for the network with <b>travel</b> time <b>information</b> provided by the RGS. The lower-level problem is a probit-based traffic assignment model, while the upper-level problem is to determine the speed detector density that minimizes the measured travel time error variance as well as the social cost of the speed detectors. The sensitivity analysis based algorithm is proposed for the bilevel programming problem. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model and of the solution algorithm. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
