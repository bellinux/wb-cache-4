25|$|Cold seeps do {{not last}} indefinitely. As {{the rate of}} gas seepage slowly decreases, the shorter-lived, methane-hungry mussels (or more precisely, their methane-hungry {{bacterial}} symbionts) start to die off. At this stage, tubeworms become the dominant organism in a seep community. As {{long as there is}} some sulfide in the sediment, the sulfide-mining tubeworms can persist. Individuals of one <b>tubeworm</b> species Lamellibrachia luymesi have been estimated to live for over 250 years in such conditions.|$|E
25|$|Tubeworms {{are either}} male or female. One recent {{discovery}} {{indicates that the}} spawning of female Lamellibrachia appears to have produced a unique association with the large bivalve Acesta bullisi, which lives permanently attached to the anterior tube opening of the <b>tubeworm,</b> and feeds on the periodic egg release (Järnegren et al., 2005). This close association between the bivalves and tubeworms was discovered in 1984 (Boland, 1986) but not fully explained. Virtually all mature Acesta individuals are found on female rather than male tubeworms. This evidence and other experiments by Järnegren et al. (2005) seem to have solved this mystery.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{similarities}} {{indicate that}} Palaeozoic problematic <b>tubeworms,</b> e. g. tentaculitids, cornulitids, microconchids, trypanoporids, Anticalyptraea, and Tymbochoos, form a monophyletic group. This group may also include hederelloids. Members {{of this group}} share affinities with lophophorates and their evolution could have partly been driven by predation. The extinction of Palaeozoic <b>tubeworms</b> in the Middle Jurassic was possibly at least partly caused by the ecological pressure by serpulid and sabellid polychaetes. The input of Palaeozoic <b>tubeworms</b> to the general ocean biocalcification system may have been smaller in the Ordovician to Jurassic than that of calcareous polychaetes in the Late Triassic to Recent. There {{seems to have been}} some correlation between the aragonite–calcite seas and the skeletal mineralogy of Triassic–Recent polychaete <b>tubeworms...</b>|$|R

25|$|These tall {{sulphide}} chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of {{the deep}} sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source (chemosynthesis). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are {{the base of the}} food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The <b>tubeworm</b> Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.|$|E
25|$|During {{these first}} {{exploratory}} dives, symbiont-bearing taxa {{that are similar}} to those observed on the Olimpi and Anaximander mud fields were sampled and identified. This similarity is not surprising, as most of these taxa were originally described from dredging in the Nile fan. Up to five species of bivalves harboring bacterial symbionts colonized these methane- and sulfide-rich environments. A new species of Siboglinidae polychaete, Lamellibrachia anaximandri, the <b>tubeworm</b> colonizing cold seeps from the Mediterranean ridge to the Nile deep-sea fan, has just been described in 2010. Moreover, the study of symbioses revealed associations with chemoautotrophic Bacteria, sulfur oxidizers in Vesicomyidae and Lucinidae bivalves and Siboglinidae tubeworms, and highlighted the exceptional diversity of Bacteria living in symbiosis with small Mytilidae. The Mediterranean seeps appear to represent a rich habitat characterized by megafauna species richness (e.g., gastropods) or the exceptional size of some species such as sponges (Rhizaxinella pyrifera) and crabs (Chaceon mediterraneus), compared with their background counterparts. This contrasts with the low macro- and mega-faunal abundance and diversity of the deep Eastern Mediterranean. Seep communities in the Mediterranean that include endemic chemosynthetic species and associated fauna differ from the other known seep communities in the world at the species level but also by the absence of the large size bivalve genera Calyptogena or Bathymodiolus. The isolation of the Mediterranean seeps from the Atlantic Ocean after the Messinian crisis {{led to the development of}} unique communities, which are likely to differ in composition and structure from those in the Atlantic Ocean. Further expeditions involved quantitative sampling of habitats in different areas, from the Mediterranean Ridge to the eastern Nile deep-sea fan. Cold seeps discovered in the Sea of Marmara in 2008 have also revealed chemosynthesis-based communities that showed a considerable similarity to the symbiont-bearing fauna of eastern Mediterranean cold seeps.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{primitive}} organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system) and cnidarians (which have {{a nervous}} system consisting of a diffuse nerve net), all living multicellular animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other). All bilaterians {{are thought to have}} descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, 485-540 million years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple <b>tubeworm</b> with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as leeches, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a [...] "tail brain".|$|E

40|$|Submarine mud {{volcanism}} {{represents an}} important. pathway for methane from deeper reservoirs to the surface, where {{it enters the}} benthic carbon cycle. To quantify overall methane release from the Captain Arutyunov mud volcano (CAMV) and to assess the contribution of macrobenthic seep organisms to the regulation of the benthic methane flux, we linked water column methane concentrations, seabed methane emission and pore water geochemistry to the spatial distribution of seep biota. Prominent organisms of the CAMV seep biota were 3 different species of frenulate <b>tubeworms.</b> Seabed methane emission ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 66 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1). Dense patches of <b>tubeworms</b> {{were associated with the}} lowest seabed methane emission. Elevated methane emission was associated with a sporadic distribution of <b>tubeworms</b> and the occurrence of numerous mud clasts. Despite the presence of a large subsurface methane reservoir, the estimated total methane release from CAMV was low (0. 006 x 10 (6) mol yr(- 1)). In addition to direct methane consumption by Siboglinum poseidoni, the <b>tubeworms</b> likely contribute to the retention of methane carbon in the sediment by affecting bacterial communities in the proximity of the tubes. The siboglinids create new meso-scale habitats on the sediment Surface, increasing habitat heterogeneity and introducing niches for bacterial communities...|$|R
2500|$|This {{microbial}} activity produces calcium carbonate, {{which is}} deposited on the seafloor and forms {{a layer of}} rock. During a period lasting up to several decades, these rock formations attract siboglinid tubeworms, which settle and grow along with the mussels. Like the mussels, tubeworms rely on chemosynthetic bacteria (in this case, a type that needs hydrogen sulfide instead of methane) for survival. True to any symbiotic relationship, a <b>tubeworm</b> also provides for their bacteria by appropriating hydrogen sulfide from the environment. The sulfide not only comes from the water, but is also mined from the sediment through an extensive [...] "root" [...] system a <b>tubeworm</b> [...] "bush" [...] establishes in the hard, carbonate substrate. A <b>tubeworm</b> bush can contain hundreds of individual worms, which can grow a meter or more above the sediment.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comInternational audienceSiboglinid <b>tubeworms</b> in cold seep sediments can locally modify the geochemical gradients of electron acceptors and donors, hence creating potential microhabitats for prokaryotic populations. The archaeal communities associated with sediments populated by Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis and Sclerolinum contortum Siboglinid <b>tubeworms</b> in the Storegga Slide were examined in this study. Vertical distribution of archaeal communities was investigated using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} based on 16 S rRNA genes. The active fraction of the archaeal community was assessed by using reversetranscribed rRNA. Archaeal communities associated with sediments colonized by <b>tubeworms</b> were affiliated with uncultivated archaeal lineages of the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. The composition of the active archaeal populations changed with depth indicating a reorganization of microbial communities. 16 S rRNA gene libraries were dominated by sequences affiliated to the Rice Cluster V which are unusual in marine sediment samples. Moreover, this study provides the first evidence of living Crenarchaeota of the Rice Cluster V in cold seep sediments. Furthermore, the Storegga Slide sediments harbored a high diversity of other minor groups of uncultivated lineages including Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeotal Group, Marine Benthic Group (MBG) -D, MBG-E, Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeotal Group, Lake Dagow Sediment, Val Kotinen Lake clade III, and Sippenauer Moor 1. Thus, we hypothesize that the vertical geochemical imprint created by the <b>tubeworms</b> could support broad active archaeal populations in the Siboglinidae-populated Storegga Slide sediments...|$|R

Bottom photography (processed on board the vessel) resulted in clear images of vesicomyid clam chemosynthetic communities coincidentally {{in the same manner as}} the first discovery by camera sled in the Pacific in 1977. Photography during the same LGL/MMS cruise also documented tube-worm communities in situ in the Central Gulf of Mexico for the first time (not processed until after the cruise; Boland, 1986) prior to the initial submersible investigations and firsthand descriptions of Bush Hill (...) in 1986 (Rosman et al., 1987a; MacDonald et al., 1989b). The site was targeted by acoustic [...] "wipeout" [...] zones or lack of substrate structure caused by seeping hydrocarbons. This was determined using an acoustic pinger system during the same cruise on the R/V Edwin Link (the old one, only 113ft (34m)), which used one of the Johnson Sea Link submersibles. The site is characterized by dense <b>tubeworm</b> and mussel accumulations, as well as exposed carbonate outcrops with numerous gorgonian and Lophelia coral colonies.

2500|$|With {{continuing}} experience, {{particularly on}} the upper continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico, the successful prediction {{of the presence of}} <b>tubeworm</b> communities continues to improve, however chemosynthetic communities cannot be reliably detected directly using geophysical techniques. Hydrocarbon seeps that allow chemosynthetic communities to exist do modify the geological characteristics in ways that can be remotely detected, but the time scales of co-occurring active seepage and the presence of living communities is always uncertain. These known sediment modifications include (1) precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the form of micronodules, nodules, or rock masses; (2) formation of gas hydrates; (3) modification of sediment composition through concentration of hard chemosynthetic organism remains (such as shell fragments and layers); (4) formation of interstitial gas bubbles or hydrocarbons; and (5) formation of depressions or pockmarks by gas expulsion. These features give rise to acoustic effects such as wipeout zones (no echoes), hard bottoms (strongly reflective echoes), bright spots (reflection enhanced layers), or reverberant layers (Behrens, 1988; Roberts and Neurauter, 1990). [...] "Potential" [...] locations for most types of communities can be determined by careful interpretation of these various geophysical modifications, but to date, the process remains imperfect and confirmation of living communities requires direct visual techniques.|$|E

These tubeworms {{are one of the}} most dominant organisms associated with the hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Tubeworms anchor themselves to the substratum of the hydrocarbon seep by roots located at the basal portion of their bodies. [...] Intact <b>tubeworm</b> roots have proven very difficult to obtain for study because they are extremely delicate, and often break off when a <b>tubeworm</b> is removed from hypothermal vent regions. It is unsure how long the roots of the tube worms can grow to, but root have been recovered longer than 30 m in length. A single aggregation of tubeworms can contain thousands of individuals, and the roots produced by each <b>tubeworm</b> can become tangled with the roots of neighbouring tubeworms. [...] These mats of roots are known as “ropes”, and travel down the tubes of dead tubeworms, and run through holes in rocks. The diameter and wall thickness of the <b>tubeworm</b> roots do not appear to change with distance from the trunk portion of the tubeworms body. Like the trunk portion of the body, the roots of the Vestimentiferan tubeworms are composed of chitin crystallites, which support and protect the <b>tubeworm</b> from predation and environmental stresses.
