40|$|Which kind {{of network}} fosters the {{diffusion}} of development-oriented trust? This paper carries out an empirical investigation into the causal relationships connecting four types of social networks (i. e. bonding, bridging, linking, and corporate), and different forms of trust (knowledge-based trust, social trust, trust towards public services and political institutions), {{in a community of}} entrepreneurs located in the Italian industrial district of the Tuscia. Our results suggest that the main factors fostering {{the diffusion of}} social trust among entrepreneurs is the establishment of corporate ties through professional associations. Trust in people is positively and significantly correlated also to higher levels of satisfaction and confidence in public services. Participation in voluntary organizations does not appear to increase trust towards strangers. Rather, we find evidence of the other way round: interpersonal trust seems to encourage civic engagement.

40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{study was designed}} to elicit the kinds, extensity and intensity of needs of the inmate population of Multnomah County Correctional Institution, a minimum security jail for misdemeanants. A guiding hypothesis asserted that there were unmet needs of prisoners which could be met through social work services both within and outside the institution. Almost the entire population of the institution was interviewed. Open-end and structured responses were recorded on schedules. Five broad areas of need were defined. These were 1) physical needs [...] including food, clothing, shelter, and medical care; 2) social needs [...] including interpersonal <b>ties,</b> <b>group</b> membership, religious, and recreational needs; 3) psychological needs [...] including the individual’s self concept, attitudes towards accepting help, desire for change, and his present level of achievement versus level of aspiration; 4) educational needs [...] including academic, vocational, or remedial schooling; and 5) financial needs [...] including post-release funds, debts, and employment. Statistical measures tested consistency, whether interviewers projected their own values, and interviewer reliability. Variances showed differences were due mostly to inmate traits and not interviewer bias, except that the weight given to some inmate needs varied more than chance at the. 05 level. The 59 men saw themselves as having some 102 categorized needs immediate upon release and 320 long-range needs, nearly all directly related to social work services. Findings suggested additional research in the following areas: 1. To determine the similarity or dissimilarity of inmate needs of misdemeanants elsewhere. 2. To determine to what extent community resources can be made available in responding to the needs of released prisoners. 3. To determine family needs of inmates. Implications of the study favored the use of social workers within the institution itself, evaluation of existing social work services, the establishment of a job-placement program and creation of a down-town center to serve a number of secular needs...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of buyer-supplier {{relationships}} within business groups on capital goods trade by taking into account potential simultaneous effects of business <b>group</b> <b>ties</b> on foreign direct investment. We posit that 1) foreign affiliates of business group firms have a greater propensity to import capital goods from the home country, increasing home country exports; 2) if the establishment of overseas affiliates by business group firms attracts foreign direct investment by their capital goods suppliers, business <b>group</b> <b>ties</b> are localized and the ‘trade creating’ impact of business <b>group</b> <b>ties</b> may disappear or even be reversed. Empirical analysis of capital goods imports by 1790 manufacturing affiliates operated abroad by Japanese multinational firms, combined with information on linkages with machinery suppliers within horizontal and vertical business groups, provides broad support for these predictions. Our findings suggest that it may be incorrect to infer from the absence of a simple relationship between business <b>group</b> <b>ties</b> and trade that such ties are unimportant; instead, intra-group ties may be replicated abroad through foreign direct investment. nrpages: 28 status: publishe...|$|R

Further, those in the same group are sequenced by the DSM division algorithm.
