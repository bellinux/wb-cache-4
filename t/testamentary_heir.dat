[...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a <b>testamentary</b> <b>heir.</b> He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E

The {{rules of civil}} legislation and scientists? views on the testamentary gift legal nature are analyzed. To this end historical and comparative analysis scientific research methods were used. By dint of historical scientific method the testamentary gift nature reception from Ancient Rome Law was proved. Comparative analysis scientific research method have been used during the research of current legislation rules and comparing them to appropriate rules of RUFSR and Russian Federation (RF) legislation. Famous civil law scientists? points of view are highlighted. G. A. Bunich said that a testamentary gift is a special clause in a will. B. S. Antimonov analysed civil law rules and considered that testamentary gift was an obligation. Thus a legatee was a creditor and a heritor was a debtor. Legatee received rights to demand from the heir to fulfil the will. E. O. Kharitonov supported such a position and in his Ukraine Civil Code comments considered that a testator may obligate the heir to give his o her rights to another person. S. Y. Fursa and E. I. Fursa exemplify that a testamentary gift could be an obligate to pay legatee?s debt or to buy some thing and {{to give it to}} the legatee or to give legate right to drive a car for some period. There is no term of testamentary gift in the Civil Code of Ukraine. But the subject of legate (testamentary gift) is to transfer a thing to legatee in a property or another proprietary right. A thing can {{be a part of the}} heritance or not. Rules for testamentary gifts in Ukraine and RF were compared. The Civil Code of RF has rules that testamentary gift can be established not only for <b>testamentary</b> <b>heirs</b> but for legal heirs too. Ukrainian laws don?t have such rules and a testamentary gift is an obligation for <b>testamentary</b> <b>heirs</b> only. But according to the Civil Code of Ukraine legatee has a proprietary nature. In this article author concludes that in practice a testamentary gift is an obligation mostly. Court decisions also prove it. At the same time it can not be excluded that a testamentary gift can have a proprietary nature. ??? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????? ????????????, ??? ???????????? ? ????????????-?????????????. ??? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ????? ???????? ????. ????????????-????????????? ????? ?????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ???? ???????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ?? ? ???????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????? ? ??. ?????? ????? ? ???, ??? ????????????? ????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ????? ????????????????-???????? ???????. ? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????...|$|R
50|$|By now, Louis Henri {{was trying}} to get away from the {{mistress}} who had taken over his life. In the summer of 1830, he returned to his home at St. Leu. There, he heard of the July Revolution. Sophia immediately set about to get him to recognize the new Orléans monarchy. When on 27 August 1830 he was found dead with a rope around his neck but his feet on the ground. The baroness was suspected and an inquiry was held which formally declared the death to be a suicide. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophie in the crime as they feared that she and Louis Phillippes son Aumale - the <b>testamentary</b> <b>heirs</b> of Condé - might be desinherited by the Prince after a possible flight abroad. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Condé had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation. With the evidence of death being the result of any crime appearing insufficient, the baroness was not prosecuted, although she was involved in litigation regarding the inheritance for years to come.|$|R
50|$|According to the Bulgarian {{legislation}} regulating local taxes, {{succession tax}} is levied on estate succeeded by law or by will within Bulgaria or abroad by Bulgarian citizens {{as well as}} on the estate located within Bulgaria succeeded by foreign nationals. The succeeded estate includes the movable and immovable property owned by the decedent and the rights over such property, as well as their other property rights, receivables and liabilities at the time of opening of the succession, unless otherwise provided by legislative statute. The inherited estate is subject to deductions as to the obligations and tax reliefs laid down in Bulgarian law, or in those cases where it is inherited by the state.Art. 38 lists the types of property that are tax free:• property passed to the State or municipalities;• ordinary household furnishings;• pensions not received by the decedent;• estate of Bulgarian citizens located abroad to which the succession tax of the respective state has applied.Taxable persons are:• heirs by law, such that as of 2004, succession tax in Bulgaria does not apply to the surviving spouse and the lineal heirs;• <b>testamentary</b> <b>heirs,</b> beneficiaries and legatees;• stateless persons are subject to the succession tax for inherited estate on the territory of Bulgaria, if the person in question has been permanently resident within the territory of Bulgaria (Art. 29 LTFA).The heirs may waive the succession through a unilateral act and as a result, they are subject to the succession tax. The waiver needs to be express, written and recorded in a specific book at the District Court. In case there is more than one heir, the tax is due in accordance with their share, and the taxable amount depends on the degree of kinship and the size of the inherited share. The tax is determined and communicated to each co-heir - Art. 106 and Art. 107 TIPC.|$|R

C., and. in cases of a lack, among the heirs, of persons meeting the condition expressed by art. 1087 § 1 point 1 C. C., the land contributions are further inherited by those expressed by art. 1087 § 2 C. C.

C. in connection to art. 1086 C. C, yet under the condition that they meet the precondition expressed by art. 1087 § 1 point 1 C. C. Article 1063 C. C. (in connection to art 1086 C. C.) can be fully made use of in successions to land contributions as it specifies the situations in which inheritance on general principles can take place, (i. e. on the basis of article 931 C. C. and the following). Article 1065 C. C. (in connection to art. 1086 C. C.) specifies those who might be appointed <b>testamentary</b> <b>heirs</b> to land contributions. In every case, anyone who meets the conditions entitling him or her to acquire an agricultural real estate by way of transfer of property (art. 1065 § 1 C. C), might be appointed and heir on the basis of the will. Further, someone who does not meet the above condition might still be appointed an heir, but he or she would have to be entitled to inherit the contribution by act, in the event of the decedent not leaving a will. The novelization of the Civil Code has encompassed other issues as well, among others, those connected to legacies of land contributions, the alienation of an inheritance of that of portions encompassing land contributions, of, finally, to the distribution of the inheritance.
