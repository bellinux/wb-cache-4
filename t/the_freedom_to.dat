She supervised publication of the Intellectual Freedom Manual, the Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom, and the events of Banned Books Week. Krug also helped lead the Intellectual Freedom Round Table, the Committee on Professional Ethics, <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> <b>to</b> Read Foundation, and the Intellectual Freedom Committee. In 1969, Krug became the first head of <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> <b>to</b> Read Foundation, a sister organization to the OIF.|$|E

5|$|Bodanzky read Carrano's book in 1996 and, {{impressed}} by the theme, assigned Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it into a film and transpose its setting from the 1970s to the 1990s.

Bolognesi began writing in 1997 with <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> make changes to the original story. The film was shot in early 2000 in São Paulo, and was edited and finalized in Italy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{were active}} in the trade market at the WTT Roster Player Draft on April 1, 2008. In the first round, they {{protected}} local favorite Lisa Raymond, which left Jamea Jackson unprotected. Since Jackson had substituted for Raymond in 2007, {{she had to be}} protected in the first round (Raymond's 2007 position), if <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> intended <b>to</b> keep her. Raymond, on the other hand, could have been protected in the fourth round, if <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> had protected Jackson in the first round. In the second round, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> protected Travis Parrott, who had substituted for Daniel Nestor in 2007. Parrott was still technically a WTT rookie under the rules in place at the time, even though he played for Sacramento Capitals in 2006, and for <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> traded their third round pick to the Delaware Smash for Alex Bogomolov Jr., whom had been selected by the Smash with the seventh pick in the first round. The trade forced <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> <b>to</b> leave 2006 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer unprotected. The Smash used the third round selection it acquired from <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> <b>to</b> draft Madison Brengle. In the fourth round, <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> selected Audra Cohen and left Olga Savchuk unprotected. <b>The</b> <b>Freedoms</b> did not select any roster-exempt players.|$|R

5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples.

5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised.

5|$|Judith Fingeret Krug (March 15, 1940– April 11, 2009) was an American librarian, {{freedom of}} speech proponent, and critic of censorship.

50|$|Various other {{provisions}} of the Constitution relate to religion and religious freedom.

5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people.

In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
