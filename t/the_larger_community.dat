5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E

25|$|As family {{responsibilities}} and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> {{serve as a}} protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members. Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} women to utilize health care is also heavily {{influenced}} by other forms of structural gender inequalities. These include unequal restriction on one’s mobility and behavior, as well as unequal control over financial resources. Many of these social gender inequalities can impact the way women’s health is regarded, which can in turn determine the level of access women have to healthcare services and {{the extent by which}} households and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> are willing to invest in women’s health issues.|$|E

25|$|Increase in ghetto living {{has also}} shown a {{strengthening}} of stereotyping {{due to lack of}} cross-cultural interaction, and reduction in economic and educational opportunities at large. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> which for centuries had benefited from its interactions with Islamic traditions, to create a rich cultural and social fabric, formed through amalgamation of the two diverse traditions faces a danger of fast becoming insular. Secularism in India is being seen by some as a favour to the Muslims, and not an imperative for democracy.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations has {{identified}} {{the enhancement of}} women's involvement as way to achieve gender equality {{in the realm of}} education, work, and health. This is because women play critical roles as caregivers, formally and informally, in both the household and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community.</b> Within the United States, an estimated 66% of all caregivers are female, with one-third of all female caregivers taking care of two or more people According to the World Health Organization, it is important that approaches and frameworks that are being implemented to address gender disparities in health acknowledge the fact that majority of the care work is provided by women. A meta-analysis of 40 different women's empowerment projects found that increased female participation have led to a broad range of quality of life improvements. These improvements include increases in women's advocacy demands and organization strengths, women-centered policy and governmental changes, and improved economic conditions for lower class women.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of {{scholarly}} text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and repurposing its operational units. While the university press may have originally functioned to disseminate {{the work of an}} institution’s faculty to <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university. Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much {{different from that of the}} university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of shuttering university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate.|$|E

25|$|Demonstrating courage is {{fundamental}} to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others {{were not allowed to}} protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted. Cattle raiding is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories. Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid. Today, cattle rustlers (dahalo) are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather than social prestige. Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena and whipped into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players sneak up behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys.|$|E
