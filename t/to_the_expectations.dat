5|$|Rowling {{found it}} {{difficult}} to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US). After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Evermore {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} the only game {{developed}} by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release due to its graphics and gameplay, but was criticized for not being up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> many reviewers had of its developer.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough to stand up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese Oricon music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.|$|E
5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool {{to create a sense of}} hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential.|$|E

5|$|However, {{contrary}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of the Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. {{found that}} the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) {{to pass through the}} sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

25|$|Murine {{models are}} widely used to test {{hypotheses}} linking genetic components of various diseases with sensorimotor gating.

25|$|Durham Dynamos {{failed to}} live up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> their top-of-the-table {{position}} in both Division Two of the Championship and Division Two of the League into wins in the Twenty20 Cup, as they trailed off after ending June with two wins and two losses. They failed to win a single of their next four matches, and finished fifth out of six teams in the group - only ahead of later county champions Nottinghamshire.|$|E

This result is predicted by Canady in his study investigating the effect of “rapport” between White examiners and Black children.|$|R

25|$|He {{played against}} New Zealand in a T20I at Chennai where he scored 34 off 26 balls (1 four, 2 sixes) as his side lost by only 1 run. He started his World Twenty20 {{campaign}} with a 3/24 against Afghanistan. He took 1/16 against Australia, 2/16 against Pakistan and a 2/23 against South Africa. He {{ended up being}} the highest wicket taker for India in the tournament though he could not match up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> with his bat.|$|E
25|$|The defeat raised serious alert {{not only}} in Tarnovo, but also in Constantinople, forcing John Kantakouzenos to abdicate and {{removing}} {{one of the main}} facilitators of the Ottoman invasion. Faced with threat, Bulgaria and Byzantium made an attempt for rapprochement. In 1355 a daughter of the Bulgarian Emperor, Keratsa, married Andronikos, the infant son of the new Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos. Unfortunately, the new relations between the houses of Tarnovo and Constantinople did not live up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of mounting a more significant response to the invading Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|The pair then entered 2015 WTA Finals {{as heavy}} favourites {{and the top}} seeds and lived up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> as they did not lose a single set {{en route to the}} title at the Premier Event. This was Mirza's second {{straight}} title at the Finals and she remains undefeated at the year ending tournament. The pair of Hingis-Mirza topped their group and beat the Chan's in the semi-finals and Garbiñe Muguruza and Carla Suárez Navarro in the finals to win the title. The pair thus ended the year with a 22 match winning streak and Mirza secured the year ending No. 1 ranking and wrapped up her 2015 season with 10 WTA titles including two Grand Slams.|$|E
