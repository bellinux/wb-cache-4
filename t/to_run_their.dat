5|$|Following the {{decision}} by Fianna Fáil not <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> own candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate. However, on 11 September the party's chief whip, Seán Ó Fearghail, {{made it clear that}} individual TDs and senators would not be permitted to sign the nomination papers of independent candidates. He said that if the party decided to support a candidacy it would be done collectively.|$|E
5|$|Pritzker and her husband, Brian Traubert, {{have their}} own {{foundation}} called the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation. The foundation focuses on physical activity for young people. Among their initiatives were a $5million donation to converting grass soccer fields to easier-to-maintain turf and a $1million donation to repair tennis courts around Chicago. The Pritzkers also established ChicagoRun, a program that prepares Chicago-area children <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> first 5k race.|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> new system of estates.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War {{is based}} upon the {{building}} of an empire across medieval Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It focuses on the warfare, religion and politics of the time to ultimately lead the player in conquest of the known world. As with the preceding Total War game, Shogun: Total War, the game consists of two broad areas of gameplay: a turn-based campaign map that allows the user to move armies across provinces, control agents, diplomacy, religion, and other tasks needed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> faction, and a real-time battlefield, where the player directs the land battles and sieges that occur.|$|E
5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to assist him. They continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E

5|$|Through 1958, over 6000 {{individuals}} took Wood Badge and {{its popularity}} continued to expand. Local councils agitated {{for the opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> own Wood Badge courses. In 1953, the first council-run program was hosted by the Cincinnati Area (later Dan Beard) Council. Qualified local councils continued to provide advanced leadership training to Scoutmasters and other Scout leaders using Wood Badge. Two or more councils are allowed to join together to present Wood Badge with regional approval.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>their</b> own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E

25|$|In the 1820s, the Principality of Svaneti {{effectively}} {{split into}} two {{as a result of}} a blood feud between the rival Dadeshkeliani branches.
