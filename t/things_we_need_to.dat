On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base."

Minnesota State failed to score on six power play opportunities and Josh Robinson stopped all 29shots. In the second game, Huskies goals from Jacob Johnstone, Blake Pietila and Tanner Kero were matched by Minnesota State, and the game was tied 3–3 after two periods. The Mavericks took advantage of Michigan Tech's penalties and sloppy defensive play in the third period and scored two more goals against Josh Robinson, plus an empty-net goal, to win the game 6–3.

50|$|Causality {{is one of}} the key {{concepts}} employed in the sciences.

While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is philosophers who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.|$|E

Wood, who did not set a qualifying time after a crash in practice, finished 14th after starting from pitlane. Perkins failed to finish due to badly damaged steering caused by brushing the wall. Rick {{was the only one of}} the four drivers to finish the second race, again in 10th place. Todd Kelly and Jack Perkins both inflicted steering damage from contact with other cars while Dale Wood spun into the wall. The team left the weekend with Rick Kelly 8th in the championship standings, Todd Kelly in 16th, Dale Wood in 24th and Jack Perkins in 30th. Todd made the following comment on the team's first weekend: [...] "Getting an event under our belt, we've now got pages and pages of <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> address and improve on.

5000|$|Once sworn into Congress in January 1993, Shepherd {{was placed}} on the Natural Resources and the Public Works and Transportation Committees.

Among many recommendations, they proposed gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers be banned and that Members be barred from chairing more than one committee. She supported President Clinton’s 1993 Budget package that cut the budget and also raised taxes on upper income people. The budget passed by a single vote. “It seems to me it’s not perfect,” Shepherd said of the proposed budget. “But the worst of all of the alternatives is not to pass it, and not move forward to health care, free trade and all of these <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do.” She also supported the Brady Bill and the Assault Weapon Ban. Her willingness to take tough stands in her District {{and at the same time}} stand up to her party on issues of reform led one prominent columnist to say just before her election, “But whether Shepherd wins or loses, her stand is a reminder of a formula for successful progressive politics that’s been characteristic of the western states.” ...|$|E
50|$|In {{his article}} “Decolonizing the University: New Directions”, Achille Mbembe {{discusses}} the limits {{placed on the}} decolonization efforts {{by the forces of}} neoliberalism and its connection to decolonization. He states that the role of the university is to “encourage students to develop their own intellectual and moral lives” as well as “redistribute equally the capacity to make disciplined inquiries into <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know”. By creating a representative and affirming environment also gives way to the fostering of creativity and ingenuity on college campuses. This force of creativity can be sparked through dismantling market tied learning to allow for, what Mbembe refers to as, this “free pursuit of knowledge”. By dissociating knowledge with capitalistic pressures, there can be a greater focus of energy on developing new epistemology and ontology in a South African context. It also can allow for the understanding the value of knowledge in other ways. However, he notes that higher education has been severely marketized and commercialized. Here, he claims {{there is a need to}} decolonize the spaces of management and access so that students can actually pursue knowledge freely. Furthermore, Mbembe argues that this approach can counter student interest in material versus epistemological payoff. Mbembe discusses the term decolonization, and questions whether we need to dismantle historical systems and institutions or instead focus on systems that have mutated and changed over time.|$|E
5000|$|Blair Walsh {{kicked a}} 52-yard field goal, and Zach Renner blocked a punt by Chad Cunningham that sailed {{through the end}} zone for a safety. [...] "I don't know that I've ever been {{involved}} in a game where the defense didn't let a team into the red zone one time," [...] Kiffin said. Crompton was a perfect 4-for-4 for 67 yards on a drive late in the first half, finding Marsalis Teague on a 5-yard touchdown pass for a 21-10 lead with 2:40 left. He also connected with Gerald Jones on a 51-yard score, the Vols' longest pass of the season. Despite being Tennessee's most productive receiver returning from last season, Jones had struggled with drops and mistakes while recovering from an ankle injury and wrist surgery. He had a season-best 105 yards receiving and two touchdowns. It was Georgia's Joe Cox who played the role of struggling quarterback. Cox finished 19-for-34 with 146 yards and no touchdowns. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Cox fumbled a snap, recovered and threw to Tennessee's Dennis Rogan while under pressure. The interception set up a 30-yard field goal by Daniel Lincoln to give the Vols a 24-12 lead. [...] "It's so frustrating to come out and have so many things go wrong," [...] Cox said. [...] "It's embarrassing. We are not doing the <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do as players." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{third one}} is {{avoiding}} the L 1 from being paused while L 0 {{is handling the}} specific VMEXITs by #BP and #EPT.

However, this would violate the design principle of Xen because we can’t differentiate normal VMEXITs with that caused by HVI until we obtain the control of L 1 from L 0. So we can’t just let these VMEXITs events go as they might be dangerous operations. The only {{way to do this is}} by modifying Xen code and adding logs to functions which might cause VMEXITs so as to capture related information. Actually, this is exactly what Xentrace does.
