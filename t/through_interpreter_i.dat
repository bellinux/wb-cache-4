They were loud and quick--unequal--spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh--not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly 'sacr√©,' 'diable,' and once 'mon Dieu.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I went {{myself to}} visit the native village on the hill behind Dorey, and took with me a small present of cloth, knives, and beads, to secure the good-will of the chief, and get him to send some men to catch or shoot birds for me. The houses were {{scattered}} about among rudely cultivated clearings. Two which I visited consisted of a central passage, {{on each side of}} which opened short passages, admitting to two rooms, each of which was a house accommodating a separate family. They were elevated at least fifteen feet above the ground, on a complete forest of poles, and were so rude and dilapidated that some of the small passages had openings in the floor of loose sticks, through which a child might fall. The inhabitants seemed rather uglier than those at Dorey village. They are, no doubt, the true indigenes of this part of New Guinea, living in the interior, and subsisting by cultivation and hunting. The Dorey men, on the other hand, are shore-dwellers, fishers and traders in a small way, and have thus the character of a colony who have migrated from another district. These hillmen or [...] "Arfaks" [...] differed much in physical features. They were generally black, but some were brown like Malays. Their hair, though always more or less frizzly, was sometimes short and matted, instead of being long, loose, and woolly; and this seemed to be a constitutional difference, not the effect of care and cultivation. Nearly half of them were afflicted with the scurfy skin-disease. The old chief seemed much pleased with his present, and promised (<b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> <b>I</b> brought with me) to protect my men when they came there shooting, and also to procure me some birds and animals. While conversing, they smoked tobacco of their own growing, in pipes cut from a single piece of wood with a long upright handle.|$|R

40|$|META-INTERPRETERS CLASSIC. Why are meta-interpreters so popular?. Why {{do we want}} {{to enhance}} meta-interpreters? [...] - finer {{granularity}} means slower interpretation [...] - space doubling The meta-interpreter itself has to be interpreted by an interpreter which we call a core interpreter of the programming language. Many procedures may be doubled as they exist both in the core interpreter and in the meta-interpreter. It is obvious that this may cause a slow down of the computation.

I told him the Agent wanted me to bring him in to talk & etc. He made an excuse for not coming before, that he had a patient to attend, and the Indians would have blamed him if he had left the sick man; but said he had cured him, and he had gone home this morning and he, Nock-ay-det-klinne, was now ready to go with me. I told him that was all right and if it was all explained he would be released in a few days. I then ordered a guard detailed noncommissioned officer and eight men; told him who was In charge of that, Sergeant E McDonald, Troop E, 6th Cavalry; that if he tried to escape he would be killed. He smiled and said he did not want to escape, he was perfectly willing to go. I then told him that if there were an attempt at rescue he would be killed. He smiled at that also, and said no one would attempt to rescue him. I also told him he could take part of his family along with him.
