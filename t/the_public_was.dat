5|$|Ahead of Roy's {{arrival in}} the Mariana Islands and Guam, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> given {{sufficient}} warning by the local disaster preparedness team. An estimated 1,200 people evacuated to shelters across Guam and all flights {{to and from the}} island were canceled for January 12.|$|E
5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>was</b> distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> outraged. A mob {{threatened}} {{to attack the}} governor at his home. A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen {{and a group of}} Slaton's friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob. Slaton had been a popular governor, but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{redevelopment}} of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1994. During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch {{in the north of}} England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, Imperial War Museum North, in Trafford, Greater Manchester.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> interested in the animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E

5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season of The X-Files, Deep Throat {{provided}} Mulder and Scully with information {{they would have been}} otherwise unable to obtain. As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he {{was in a position to}} know a great deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> just not ready to know some truths.|$|E

5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was,</b> by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic The Prodigal (1955), {{followed}} by the John Wayne adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This was a difficult time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> staying home. Turner {{was just one of}} MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, {{a secret}} United States Department of Defense {{history of the}} United States' {{political}} and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts {{as a series of}} articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
