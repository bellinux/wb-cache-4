40|$|The {{partition}} {{behavior of}} glycomacropeptide (GMP) was determined in polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium citrate aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). It {{was found that}} the partitioning of GMP depends on PEG molar mass, tie line length, pH, NaCl concentration and temperature. The obtained data indicates that GMP is preferentially partitioned into the PEG phase without addition of NaCl at pH 8. 0. Larger tie line lengths and higher temperatures favor GMP partition to the PEG phase. Furthermore, it was verified that PEG molar mass and concentration have a slight effect on GMP partition. The increase in the molar mass of PEG induces a reduction of the protein solubility in the <b>top</b> <b>PEG</b> rich phase, being shown that the use of PEG 1500 is beneficial for the extraction of GMP. A protein recovery higher than 85 % was obtained in the top phase of these systems, clearly demonstrating its suitability {{as a starting point for}} the separation of GMP.

40|$|Protective antigen (PA) is a {{nontoxic}} protein {{present in}} anthrax toxin. Domain 4 of PA (PA-D 4) {{acts as a}} receptor binding site for tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM 8). In this study, KYND motif from PA-D 4 was utilized as a ligand against TEM 8. The efficiency of KYND motif on cellular association was assessed by evaluating the cellular uptake of PEGylated liposomes (PEG-LPs) in TEM 8 positive and negative cells. The peptide was attached on the <b>top</b> of the <b>PEG</b> of PEG-LP. Compared to PEG-LP, KYND modified PEG-LP (KYND-PEG-LP) enhanced the cellular uptake {{to a greater extent}} in all cell lines. Based on the inhibition assay, no receptor involvement was observed in the cellular association of KYND-PEG-LP, suggesting that KYND motif functions as a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) which facilitated the internalization of PEG-LP via clathrin mediated endocytosis pathway. Further enhancement of cellular uptake was observed when KYND-PEG-LP was combined with octaarginine (R 8) on the surface of lipid membrane as dual-CPP ligand formulation, however, when PEG-LP combined with only R 8, only negligible enhancement was observed. These findings suggest that two CPP ligands act in a synergistic fashion; therefore the dual-CPP ligand based liposomal formulation can be assumed to be an effective delivery system...|$|R

50|$|The concert harp is a pedal harp. Pedals {{were first}} used in 1697. Pedal harps use the {{mechanical}} action of pedals {{to change the}} pitches of the strings. There are seven pedals, each affecting the tuning of all strings of one pitch-class. The pedals, in order from left to right, are D, C, B (on the left side) and E, F, G, A (on the right). Each pedal {{is attached to a}} rod or cable within the column of the harp, which then connects with a mechanism within the neck. When a pedal is moved with the foot, small discs {{at the top of the}} harp rotate. The discs are studded with two pegs that pinch the string as they turn, shortening the vibrating length of the string. Each pedal has three positions. In the <b>top</b> position no <b>pegs</b> are in contact with the string and all notes are flat; thus the harp's native tuning is to the scale of C major. In the middle position the top disc presses its pins against the string, resulting in a natural, giving the scale of C major if all pedals are set in the middle position. In the bottom position the second, lower disc is turned, shortening the string again to create a sharp, giving the scale of C major if all pedals are set in the bottom position.|$|R

The top phase polymers are increasing in hydrophobicity with increasing content of PO. Reppal PES 200 (hydroxypropyl starch) {{was used as}} the bottom phase polymer. Phase diagrams for Reppal PES 200 -PEG and Reppal PES 200 -EO 30 PO 70 two-phase systems were determined. The partitioning of four salts with different hydrophobicity, and also the effect of the salts on protein partitioning in these systems, was studied. It was found that the partitioning of the salts followed the Hofmeister series. The partitioning of proteins with low surface hydrophobicity, myoglobin and cytochrome c, was little affected by hydrophobic polymers and salts. However, the partitioning of a protein with higher surface hydrophobicity, lysozyme, was strongly affected when polymer hydrophobicity was increased and a hydrophobic counterion was used. A protein with a relatively hydrophobic surface can be partitioned to a phase containing a thermoseparating EO-PO copolymer by using a hydrophobic counterion. The partitioning of lysozyme and cytochrome c in the polymer-water system formed after temperature-induced phase separation was also examined. Both proteins partitioned exclusively to the water phase. A separation of the protein and polymer was obtained by temperature-induced phase separation on the isolated phase containing the EO-PO copolymer.

The oleate bilayers were prepared {{in two different}} ways; (i) oleic acid was added directly into the magnetite co-precipitation mixture containing the MNPs to obtain OA@s-MNP samples - s-MNP standing for "as-synthesized MNP" and (ii) sodium oleate (oleate anion, OA) {{was added to the}} purified MNPs to obtain OA@p-MNP samples - p-MNP standing for "purified MNP". The effect of the surfactant addition method on the pH- and ionic strength-dependent stability (dynamic laser light scattering and laser-Doppler electrophoresis experiments), the biomedical applicability (MRI measurements) and the biocompatibility (blood sedimentation and blood smear tests) of the core-shell MNPs was studied. Different mechanisms of oleate adsorption were found in ATR FT-IR experiments (inner sphere surface complexation via ligand exchange for the s-MNPs and additional H-bonding for the p-MNPs), suggesting different behaviour. The colloidal stability and salt tolerance of the two kinds of OA@MNPs were similar, but the hydrodynamic diameter of the OA@s-MNP was considerably larger than that of OA@p-MNP. In accordance with this, the r 2 relaxation was also higher for the s-MNP samples (~ 400 and ~ 200 mM- 1 s- 1, respectively). The physico-chemical tests indicate that the OA-coated MNPs form clusters and the degree of clustering of OA@s-MNPs is significantly greater than that of OA@p-MPNs. PEGylation does not appear to affect colloidal stability and salt tolerance meaningfully. The adsorption of PEG was proved experimentally. We have found that the <b>PEG</b> <b>top</b> layer decreases the electrostatic contribution, nevertheless increases the steric contribution of the original electrosteric stabilization caused by the OA double layer. However, an increase in the molecular weight above 1000 Da and the amount of added PEG above 5 mmol/g gradually reduces the salt tolerance of the samples.

40|$|The amyloid beta peptide {{particularly}} the 40 and 42 amino acid residues are the responsible for plaque formation in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) patients. Extra cellular plaque formation {{has been recognized}} after incessant investigations along {{with the formation of}} intracellular tau protein tangles as the hallmarks of AD. Furthermore, the plaque formation has been linked mostly as a cause of the disease and the tangles mostly as a consequence. Our investigation is focused on studying the formation of AD plaques. The amyloid beta (A[beta]) is a physiological peptide secreted from neurons under normal conditions, along with other soluble forms cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). These soluble forms of APP have neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions, while the A[beta] is considered an unwanted by-product of the APP processing. Under normal conditions there is an anabolic/catabolic equilibrium of the A[beta] peptide; therefore, it is believed that the formation of the plaque does not take place. On the other hand, the neurons 2 ̆ 7 surface may {{play an important role in}} the adhesion mechanisms of the A[beta] peptide. Our experiments show that the neuron surfaces along with the media conditions may be the most important causes for progressive formation of plaques. We have incubated rigid supports (mica) and soft biomimetic substrates (lipid bilayers on <b>top</b> of a <b>PEG</b> cushion layer drafted onto a silica surface) with the three different conformations of the A[beta] peptide (monomeric, oligomeric and fibrils structures) to determine the adhesion mechanisms associated with in situ plaque formation. The soft biomimetic substrates have been assembled first by depositing and activating a thin film of silica (i. e., to create surface silanol groups). This film is then reacted with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is a biocompatible polymer, to create a cushion-like layer that supports and allows the lipid bilayer to have high mobility. A lipid bilayer is then deposited on this soft support to reproduce a cell membrane using the Langmuir Blodgett deposition technique. The characterization of such biomimetic membranes has been studied by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in liquid environments. Our results show that these lipid bilayers are highly mobile. Additionally the structure and topography characteristics of the A[beta] conformations have been followed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The kinetics and rates of adhesion have been measured with attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.
