In this paper, we analyze the redistributive and stabilizing effects of two scenarios of fiscal integration in the Eurozone, namely the introduction of i) a joint tax and transfer system that replaces 10 per cent of national systems and ii) a system of fiscal equalization that equalizes 10 per cent of differences in <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Based on the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD and representative household micro data for the current 17 euro area member states, our conceptual experiment shows that a joint tax and transfer system would only lead to moderate gains in terms of stabilization while redistribution would flow especially towards the Eastern European member states. In contrast, a fiscal equalization mechanism that redistributes revenues across countries could even lead to destabilizing effects...|$|E
40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} first reviews the spread of LTUs, and briefly {{describes}} the experience of LTUs in a few selected countries. This section takes up {{the question of the}} LTU as an enclave administrative reform versus semi-autonomous revenue agencies and "whole of government" reform involving broad based wages, human resources planning and anti-corruption measures. Part II examines the emergence of the LTU and its relationships to the remainder of the tax administration system in different kinds of developing and transition economies, such as (i) capable developing states, (ii) administratively weak but governance improving states, and (iii) captured states. The relative success of LTUs can improve our understanding of the enclave approach to governance reforms as well as yielding insights that are intrinsic to the challenge of improving revenue mobilization. LTUs and their roles in developing country economies can also be interpreted through the prism of recent revisionist writings on best policies for the tax mix {{in the presence of a}} major informal sector and a government sector with a highly constrained <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> and high vulnerability to corruption.

40|$|ACL- 2 International audienceThe {{current debt}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a debate about deeper fiscal {{integration}} in Europe. The view is widespread that moving towards a 'fiscal union' would have a stabilising effect in the event of macroeconomic shocks. In this paper we study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: Firstly, an EU-wide tax and transfer system and secondly, an EU-wide system of fiscal equalisation. Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 Eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and to study their effects on the distribution of income as well as their impact on automatic fiscal stabilisers. We find that replacing one third of the national tax and transfer systems by a European system would lead to significant redistributive effects both within and across countries. These effects depend on income levels and the structures of the existing national tax and transfer systems. The EU system would improve fiscal stabilisation especially in credit constrained countries. It would absorb between 10 and 15 per cent of a macroeconomic income shock. Introducing a fiscal equalisation system based on <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> would redistribute revenues from high to low income countries. The stabilisation properties of this system, however, are ambiguous. This suggests that not all forms of fiscal integration will improve macroeconomic stability in the Eurozone...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I examine various {{innovations}} {{to better}} monitor local tax collection {{implemented by the}} Qing court from the 1730 s onward, which have been neglected {{in the literature on}} Qing bureaucracy. These methods included improving the format of tax receipts so as to constrain abuses by clerks in collecting land taxes; clarification of items of collected revenues to facilitate account checking during routine rotation of magistrates; and the use of comparison with previous records of land tax collection to discipline magistrates in collecting land taxes. The last measure was borrowed from the management of domestic customs. These efforts continued at least through the reigns of Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang; and the method of comparison was extended to the management of the collection of lijin duties after 1863. But why did these efforts fail to enhance the <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Qing government? To answer this question, I use the principal-agent theory to analyze archival materials on the collection of land taxes and domestic customs in the period from 1730 and 1840; and I also compare the Qing administrative reforms to those of other early modern states. I show that the lack of concentrated production of commodities and the prevalence of small farming seriously restricted the effectiveness of Qing institutional innovations to monitor tax collection in practice. As a result, the center had little means to obtain the information necessary to tell whether tax arrears were caused by economic downturns, by officials’ under-performance in collection, or by the diversion of revenues...|$|E
40|$|The special {{drawing rights}} (SDRs) [...] the International Monetary Fund's unit of account [...] could emerge as a rival to the US dollar as an {{international}} reserve currency. Williamson questions the assertion of Cato Institute's Swaminathan Aiyar that the SDR is not a currency and can never be one and {{the relevance of the}} fact that the IMF has no GDP and no <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> and so lacks the fundamental requirements for creating a currency. It is true that only central banks accept SDRs in settlement of debts. But to the extent that they are so accepted, Williamson argues, they are money and could play a far more central role in the international monetary system than they have so far. Large SDR allocations could be a mechanism to ensure consistency in balance of payments objectives sought by countries around the world, one that ensures a much fairer distribution of gains from seigniorage [...] profit that accrues to whoever issues money. In the case of the SDRs, the IMF would be the issuer, and the seigniorage gains would be distributed in proportion to IMF quotas, which determine the proportion of allocations. For most countries, there is a clear advantage in boosting the role of the SDR and achieving a portion of the seigniorage gains. The interests of major reserve-currency countries, like the United States and potentially China, in displacing the dollar's reserve role can be disputed, but these countries too would benefit from an enhanced role of the SDR, depending on the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages. ...|$|E

40|$|Within a {{comparative}} theoretical wellbeing regimes framework arising from Polanyi, Esping-Andersen and recent work by Gough and Wood, the paper will reflect upon {{the position of}} the nation state and non state-centred actors in the support for welfare and the security of agency. With the nation state appearing as a key problem in a globally comparative account of social policy, the roles of other actors above and below the nation state are thus significant in any analysis of power relations, social reproduction and policy outcomes. It is clear that in many poorer countries, the problem for state actors is that power, authority and, more problematically, legitimacy lies significantly elsewhere. This is demonstrated by analytical reference to the institutional responsibility matrix (IRM), with global and national level dimensions across the domains of state, market, community and household. A review of this matrix indicates other loci of power, together with a contaminating permeability between these 4 domains of power. This negative permeability arises from a deployment of personalised social and cultural resources rather than accessible social capital (i. e. transparent and accountable), and functions to reduce the capacity of state actors to act in open democratic ways. Importantly, aspects of globalisation can interact directly with sub-national entities thus by-passing and undermining the state. MNCs deal with ethnic power structures and local warlords to access oil, minerals, precious metals and diamonds, sometimes via interlinked money laundering and arms agreements [...] thus promoting regional bases of power at the expense of central authority. International donors (including charities) sometimes leapfrog the state to implement projects via regional governments and NGOs. Remittances avoid the <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the state. Wider faith movements operate directly with their congregations. Cross border ethnic solidarities represent secessionary challenges to their respective, weakly embedded 'nation' states. Large ethnic concentrations substitute themselves for the national identity as the price for remaining part of a larger whole. Economic and political transactions are conducted through the personalised networks of kin, clan, ethnic, race, caste and other such identities, entailing exclusion and preferentialism. And there are civil society and philanthropic organisations embedded within socio-cultural institutions engaged in welfare while reproducing dependent security and engendering Faustian bargains. This is clearly a complicated institutional landscape within which to formulate the idea of responsibility for social policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{current debt}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a debate about deeper fiscal {{integration}} in Europe. The view is widespread that moving towards a ‘fiscal union’ would increase the ability of the currency union to maintain economic stability in situations where some member states are affected by economic shocks. At the same time the idea of deepening fiscal integration raises a number of concerns. In particular, residents of high income countries fear that more fiscal integration may lead to massive redistribution in favour of low income countries. As a result, taxes in high income countries could increase and undermine incentives to work and invest. Higher transfers in low income countries could also distort incentives to work. While deeper fiscal integration in Europe is thus a widely debated issue, {{little is known about the}} economic implications of sucha move. This paper contributes to filling this gap by analysing the economic effects of two key elements of fiscal integration, i) the introduction of an EU-wide integrated tax and transfer system which partly or fully replaces the existing national systems and ii) the introduction of a system of fiscal equalisation. These reforms would be far reaching, but they do reflect the widespread view that radical steps towards more fiscal integration are necessary. Even if these reforms seem unlikely to find political support in the short term, it is important to understand why this might be the case and whether much is lost if fiscal integration fails to proceed into this direction. In this paper we study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: Firstly, an EU-wide tax and transfer system and secondly, an EU-wide system of fiscal equalisation. Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 Eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and to study their effects on the distribution of income as well as their impact on automatic fiscal stabilisers. We find that replacing one third of the national tax and transfer systems by a European system would lead to significant redistributive effects both within and across countries. Our analysis confirms that labour supply incentives may be undermined in both low and high incume countries. The EU system would improve fiscal stabilisation especially in countries which cannot rely on national automatic fiscal stabilisers because they face borrowing constraints while such constraints are unlikely to occur at the EU level. The EU system would absorb between 10 and 15 per cent of a macroeconomic income shock. Introducing a horizontal fiscal equalisation system based on <b>taxing</b> <b>capacity</b> would redistribute revenues from high to low income countries. The stabilisation properties of this system, however, are ambiguous. This suggests that not all forms of fiscal integration will improve macroeconomic stability in the Eurozone...|$|E

40|$|Politicians {{care about}} tax {{revenues}} {{in part because}} they pay for transfers or public goods which are important to voters, and which are therefore important for the politician’s reelection. When economic sectors differ in their taxability, i. e. the degree to which tax revenues can be extracted by the state, politicians will thus have an incentive to allocate their support for business activity unevenly across sectors. Formalization of this idea shows that politicians will be more inclined to favor high-taxability sectors when transfers or public goods are highly valued by voters, but less likely to do so when a country’s overall <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> is high. Further, the allocation of support will depend on the relative size of the low- and high-taxability sectors, but not on the number of recipients of government transfers. Drawing upon a survey of firms in twenty-three postcommunist countries - where overall <b>tax</b> <b>capacity</b> is in many places quite low, differences in taxability across sectors is typically high, and government support for business activity is often lacking - the model’s predictions are shown to hold generally in countries with well-developed political rights and civil liberties, but only partially {{in the rest of the}} postcommunist world.
