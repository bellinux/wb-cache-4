30|$|The {{procedure}} Start of Mission (SOM) {{allows the}} start of a train and it is triggered by the driver in these cases: Once the train is awake, or once shunting movements are finished, or once a mission is ended, or once a slave engine becomes a leading engine. The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation. Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, {{the start of}} mission is not the only possibility; the engine may be remote controlled (sleeping). At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of three states: “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct) or “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong) or “Unknown”. This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone number, Train Data, <b>Train</b> <b>Running</b> <b>Number</b> and Train Position.|$|E

5000|$|The Wreck of the Virginian is an American {{folk song}} by Blind Alfred Reed {{recorded}} on July 28, 1927. The song describes {{a train wreck}} in Ingleside, West Virginia. The lyrics, which are essentially documentary, describe how, on [...] "a bright Spring morning on the twenty-fourth of May," [...] 1927, the engineer, E. G. Aldrich of Roanoke, Virginia, known as [...] "Dad," [...] and his fireman, Frank M. O'Neill of Pax, West Virginia, <b>running</b> <b>train</b> <b>number</b> three, [...] "left Roanoke en route for Huntington." [...] Then, [...] "at eleven fifty-two that day, they just left Ingleside," [...] when [...] "an east-bound freight crushed into them." [...] and they were both killed. The song also notes that [...] "Dad" [...] Aldritch had been an engineer on the line since 1906.|$|R

40|$|Making use of {{long-term}} transverse vibration monitoring data of DaShengGuan Bridge, the early-warning method of <b>train</b> <b>running</b> {{safety of the}} high-speed railway bridge is established by adopting principal component analysis (PCA) method. Firstly, the root mean square (RMS) of the transverse acceleration of the main girder is used as the monitoring parameter for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety. The correlation model between the RMS values measured from different positions is further adopted as the evaluating model for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety. Finally, {{the effects of the}} environmental changes on the evaluating model are eliminated using the PCA method and the warning index for the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety is further constructed. The analysis results show that the correlation between the RMS values of the accelerations from different measuring positions on the main girder can be analyzed by a quadratic polynomial fitting model. The PCA method can effectively remove the environmental effects on the quadratic polynomial fitting model. The proposed warning method provides a good capability for detecting the abnormal changes of the measured transverse accelerations and hence it is suitable for early-warning of the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> safety...|$|R
