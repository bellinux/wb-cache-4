50|$|Recoil and counter-recoil were {{controlled}} hydraulically {{by means of}} a piston and spring combination connected to the recoiling mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary <b>trunnion</b> <b>block</b> assembly. The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the <b>trunnion</b> <b>block</b> group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly.|$|E
50|$|The gun was, {{for ease}} of use in trenches, single shot; the gunner had to extract the empty case of a fired {{cartridge}} manually and reload the gun after firing each round, which gave it a low rate of fire. It had a simple block breech with percussion gear, and was mounted on a non-recoiling frame consisting of a hydraulic buffer, <b>trunnion</b> <b>block,</b> and rear guide tube. Hand grips were mounted on the guide tube. The gun had a large muzzle brake to reduce recoil.|$|E
50|$|Some trouble {{has been}} taken to dampen engine vibration. The engine and {{separate}} gearbox are on a subframe. The engine is flexibly held by two sets of enclosed springs at the front end and at the back by semi-circular steel <b>trunnion</b> <b>blocks.</b> These blocks are secured by spring-loaded bolts. This way the engine is held firmly in a fore and aft position but can swing {{to the limits of}} the two sets of enclosed front springs.|$|R
