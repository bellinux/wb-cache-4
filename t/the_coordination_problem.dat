50|$|The example {{illustrates}} some of {{the advantages}} of using multiple languages in development. There are, however, also difficulties associated with this kind of development. These difficulties stem from the observation that the more kinds of artifacts we introduce into our process, the more coordination between developer efforts is needed. We will refer to these difficulties as <b>the</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Problem.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Problem</b> has a conceptual and a technical aspect. Conceptually, the main problem is to understand the different languages and their interaction. To properly design and coordinate models in multiple languages, developers must have a sufficient understanding of how languages interact. Technically, the main problem is to enforce consistency. Tools must be provided to detect inconsistencies early, i.e., at modeling time, and assist developers in resolving these inconsistencies. In the following, we will examine these two aspects in greater detail.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} games are {{coordination}} games where equilibrium selection {{is an important}} problem.

50|$|Successful {{development}} of a modern enterprise system requires the convergence of multiple views.

Their different work products must be managed, aligned, and integrated to produce a running system. Every participant of the development process has a particular language tailored to solve problems specific to its view on the system.

50|$|Fearon and Laitin do propose some {{solutions}} to these problems. To solve the recruitment problem, they argue {{for having a}} powerful state with security interests in the failed state {{to take the lead}} in the peacekeeping operations and serve a point role.

Finally, forcing the failed state to contribute funds to peacekeeping operations after several years can reduce the incentives of the peacekeepers to exit. Fearon and Laitin believe that multilateral interventions which solve the above four collective action problems will be more effective at rebuilding failed states through neotrusteeship.|$|E

50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{coordination}} method is to solve <b>the</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>problem</b> and thereby provide better support for development with multiple languages. To properly appreciate the method, {{it is important to}} understand that it does not prescribe the design of individual languages. Plenty of methods and tools have already been proposed for this. This method assumes the existence of a setup with multiple domain-specific languages. Given such a setup, one can apply the method. The method consists of three steps as shown in the diagram below. Each step consist of a couple of parts which are shown as little boxes in the diagram. Boxes with dotted lines represent automatic processes and boxes with solid lines represent manual ones. In the following, we will explain these steps in a bit more detail.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>problem</b> {{arises from}} the fact that {{multiple}} languages are used in a single system. The two previous Subsections illustrate that this problem has both a conceptual side as well as a low-level technical side. The challenges that we have described are real rather than hypothetical challenges. Specifically, we have faced these challenges in two concrete and representative case studies: an enterprise resource planning system, OFBiz, and a health care system, the District Health Information System (DHIS). Both cases are medium-sized systems that are in actual industrial use. Our solution to the practical problems we have encountered during our work with these systems are a set of guidelines and prototypes. In the following, we will introduce an overall conceptual framework which incorporates the guidelines and prototypes into a coherent method: the coordination method.|$|E
50|$|The {{coordination}} method {{can best}} {{be seen as a}} conceptual framework that prescribes a certain workflow when working with multiple languages. The three successive steps that constitute this workflow are not supported by an integrated workbench or development environment. The focus is rather on extending the developer's existing environments to add support for (1) identification, (2) specification, and (3) application. The main advantage of this approach has been that developers have actually tested our work and given us feedback. This kind of evaluation of the method is valuable because it reduces the risk of solving a purely hypothetical problem. Several papers introduce the different steps of the coordination method, report on this evaluation, and elaborates on the technical aspects of each individual experiment. Overall, the results have been promising: a significant number of errors have been found in production systems and given rise to a constructive dialog with developers on future tool requirements. A development process based on these guidelines and supported by tools constitutes a serious attempt to solve <b>the</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>problem</b> and make domain-specific multimodeling a practical proposition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a dynamic variant of a coordination problem that was studied in, e. g., [9, 7, 8].

40|$|Abstract—In {{real power}} systems, the network {{topology}} {{is subjected to}} uncertainty due to single-line outage contingencies, maintenance activities, and network reconfigurations. These changes in the network topology may lead to miscoordination of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs). To overcome this drawback, corresponding to each primary/backup relay pair, a set of inequality coordination constraints which is related to different network topologies should be satisfied. In this paper, a new approach based on the interval analysis is introduced to solve <b>the</b> DOCRs <b>coordination</b> <b>problem</b> considering uncertainty in the network topology. The basic idea is to convert the set of inequality constraints corresponding to each relay pair to an interval constraint. In this situation, <b>the</b> DOCR <b>coordination</b> <b>problem</b> is formulated as an interval linear programming (ILP) problem. Using well-known mathematical theorems, the obtained ILP problem, which has no equality constraints, {{can be converted to}} standard linear programming (LP). As a result, <b>the</b> number of <b>coordination</b> constraints is significantly reduced in the proposed methods. The application of the proposed method to the IEEE 14 -and 30 -bus test systems proves the ability of the interval method in modeling topology uncertainty in <b>the</b> large-scale <b>coordination</b> <b>problem.</b> Index Terms—Different network topologies, interval analysis, in-terval linear programming (ILP), overcurrent relay coordination.
