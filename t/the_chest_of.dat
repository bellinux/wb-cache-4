5|$|Queen Elizabeth {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chest</b> <b>of</b> Saint Simeon in 1381. The chest, located in Zadar, is of great importance {{for the history of}} the city, as it depicts various historical events– such as the death of her father– and Elizabeth herself. According to legend, she stole the saint's finger and paid for the creation of the casket in order to atone for her sin. The casket contains a scene which allegedly depicts the queen gone mad after stealing the relict.|$|E
5000|$|Sensors {{to measure}} chest {{expansion}} during inhalation provide direct information of sniff cycles. [...] These methods include mechanical and optical devices. Mechanical devices for sniffing measurements are piezo foils placed under <b>the</b> <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> small animals and strain gauge around <b>the</b> <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> larger animals. In both cases, a positive increase in signal output (voltage) {{can be identified}} and used to index inhalation events. Alternatively, a photo transducer can {{be placed on the}} opposite side <b>of</b> an animal's <b>chest</b> from a light source (e.g., a Light-emitting diode). In this design, a decrease in signal reflects inhalation (<b>chest</b> expansion) as <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> would interrupt <b>the</b> light passage to the photo transducer.|$|R

5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} and Clemson's kick returner {{ran out of}} bounds at the Tigers' 12-yard line. Dantzler scrambled for two yards, but Virginia Tech linebacker Jake Houseright was injured during the play and left the game. After a delay while the injured Houseright was helped off the field, Dantzler scrambled for six yards. Bernard Rambert gained a first down with a two-yard run, then he gained five yards on a run up the middle. Dantzler followed the gain with a 13-yard run {{of his own and}} a first down at the Clemson 40-yard line. Rambert caught a five-yard pass from Dantzler, then he ran for one yard up {{the left side of the}} field. During the play, Rambert was injured and had to be helped off the field. He was replaced by third-string freshman running back Keith Kelly. Dantzler threw an incomplete pass on third down, then Somaini punted the ball to Virginia Tech. The kick bounced off <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia Tech kick returner, and the loose ball was scooped up by Robert Carswell of Clemson.

25|$|The formalised {{system of}} chest {{compression}} {{was really an}} accidental discovery made in 1958 by William Bennett Kouwenhoven, Guy Knickerbocker, and James Jude at Johns Hopkins University. They were studying defibrillation in dogs when they noticed that by forcefully applying the paddles to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> the dog, they could achieve a pulse in the femoral artery. Further meticulous experimentation involving dogs answered such basic questions as how fast to press, where to press, and how deep to press. This information gave them the belief that they were ready for human trials.|$|E

In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray of blood on <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving from}} Chicago in 1963, the then-Baltimore Bullets used red and navy colors {{as part of}} the team's logos and uniforms. In 1969, the club changed the colors to blue and orange.

25|$|Although live jewelry has {{featured}} in Mayan cultural traditions for many centuries, {{it was not}} until the 1980s that the Mexican maquech beetle, a subspecies of the zopherus beetle, achieved mainstream popularity as live jewelry. The maquech beetle is a large, docile, wingless insect which is decorated with gold and semi-precious gemstones and is attached to a decorative safety pin by a chain leash. During the Mayan period, women from the Yucatán Peninsula wore maquech beetles pinned to their chests, over their hearts, to attract and sustain loving relationships. The tradition is attributed to a story from Mayan folklore, which believes that when a Mayan princess was not permitted to marry a prince from a rival clan whom she loved, she stopped eating and drinking, preferring to die than to live without her lover. In compassion with her plight, a traditional healer with magical powers transformed her into a maquech beetle, so that she could spend the rest of her life living as a beautiful brooch on <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> her lover, close to his heart.|$|E
25|$|Body armour in the Macedonian {{army was}} derived from a repertiore found {{throughout}} the Greek-speaking world. The {{most common form of}} armour was the linothorax, which was a cuirass of stiff linen built up of glued or stitched layers of textile; though it is possible that linen was used as a facing material over leather. It was composed of the 'girdle' a tubular section, often of four vertical panels, that enclosed the torso. A shoulder-piece was attached to the upper rear section of the girdle, this element was split into two wings which were pulled forward over the top of each shoulder and laced to the chest-section of the girdle. Ancient representations show the shoulder pieces standing vertical when not laced down to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>of</b> the corselet. This suggests that the linothorax as a whole was very stiff and inflexible. Pteruges, strips of linen or leather, protected the upper arms and hips of the wearer. The linothorax could be reinforced with plate bronze or bronze scale elements. Defences of a similar appearance composed of quilted textile are also described.|$|E
