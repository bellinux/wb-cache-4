30|$|Hence, in {{this paper}} we propose a model we have applied in BEAT, which is based on the {{possibility}} of defining three main learning paths, by focusing, respectively, on the object, the process and the subject of learning (Guerra et al. 2008). In order to support didactical material authors in creating e-learning content by means of the BEAT authoring tool, we proposed a structure template which equipped authors with a predefined organization of the learning objects as for goals, content, assessments, <b>tools,</b> <b>references,</b> etc. The proposed approach is suitable in supporting authors, let them create content taking into account pedagogical and didactical aspects, not only technical point of views. At the same time, such an approach does not constrain the author, letting him/her freely choose a specific methodology, in particular the most feasible and suitable one, according to his/her didactical needs.|$|R
