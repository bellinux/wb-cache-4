5|$|Laird SM, Gray BM. Intermittent {{inhalation}} of methoxyflurane and <b>trichloroethylene</b> as an analgesic in burns dressings procedures. Br. J. Anaesth. 1971; 43: 149–59.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), <b>trichloroethylene</b> (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than <b>trichloroethylene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, <b>trichloroethylene,</b> perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Much of what {{is known}} about the human health effects of <b>trichloroethylene</b> is based on {{occupational}} exposures. Beyond the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to <b>trichloroethylene</b> has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney. Over time, occupational exposure limits on <b>trichloroethylene</b> have tightened, resulting in more stringent ventilation controls and personal protective equipment use by workers.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, trace {{concentrations}} of <b>trichloroethylene</b> {{were found in}} Kennedy Creek at the Interstate 81 overpass. However, in September 2006, the creek was found not to contain <b>trichloroethylene,</b> perchloroethylene, or DCE.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichloroethylene</b> is an {{effective}} solvent {{for a variety of}} organic materials.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{widespread}} {{use as a}} metal degreaser, <b>trichloroethylene</b> itself is unstable {{in the presence of}} metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating <b>trichloroethylene</b> to its boiling point in a reflux condenser and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was dioxane; however, its use was patented by Dow Chemical Company and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for <b>trichloroethylene.</b> Other chemical stabilizers include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 it was {{announced}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that the agency had completed its Final Health Assessment for <b>Trichloroethylene</b> and released a list of new TCE toxicity values. The {{results of the study}} have formally characterized the chemical as a human carcinogen and a non-carcinogenic health hazard. A 2011 toxicological review performed by the EPA continues to list <b>trichloroethylene</b> as a known carcinogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} species Nitrosomonas europaea can degrade {{a variety}} of halogenated compounds including <b>trichloroethylene,</b> benzene, and vinyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|Today, however, most <b>trichloroethylene</b> is {{produced}} from ethylene. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a ferric chloride catalyst to produce 1,2-dichloroethane.|$|E
25|$|Existing EU {{legislation}} {{aimed at}} {{protection of workers}} against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers health during the use phase or throughout {{the life cycle of}} <b>trichloroethylene.</b> However, in case the ongoing discussions under the Carcinogens Directive will result in setting of a binding Occupational Exposure Limit for <b>trichloroethylene</b> for protection of workers; this conclusion may be revisited.|$|E
25|$|State, federal, and {{international}} agencies classify <b>trichloroethylene</b> as a known or probable carcinogen. In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated its classification of <b>trichloroethylene</b> to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it causes {{cancer of the}} kidney in humans {{as well as some}} evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. California EPA regulators consider it a known carcinogen and issued a risk assessment in 1999 that concluded that it was far more toxic than previous scientific studies had shown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichloroethylene</b> was {{marketed as}} 'Ecco 1500 Anti-Static Film Cleaner and Conditioner' until 2009, {{for use in}} {{automatic}} movie film cleaning machines, and for manual cleaning with lint-free wipes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about its toxicity, {{the use of}} <b>trichloroethylene</b> in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned {{in much of the}} world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of <b>trichloroethylene</b> in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 risk phrase, May cause cancer. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.|$|E
25|$|Research from Cancer bioassays {{performed}} by the National Cancer Institute (later the National Toxicology Program) showed that exposure to <b>trichloroethylene</b> is carcinogenic in animals, producing liver cancer in mice, and kidney cancer in rats.|$|E
25|$|In the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) {{recommends}} an {{exposure limit}} for workers exposed to <b>trichloroethylene</b> of 10ppm (54.7mg/m3) for 8-hour TWA and of 30ppm (164.1mg/m3) for STEL (15 minutes).|$|E
25|$|Until recent years, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) {{contended that}} <b>trichloroethylene</b> had little-to-no {{carcinogenic}} potential, and {{was probably a}} co-carcinogen—that is, it acted in concert with other substances to promote the formation of tumors.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} compound <b>trichloroethylene</b> is a halocarbon commonly {{used as an}} industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. It {{should not be confused}} with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, which is commonly known as chlorothene.|$|E
25|$|The National Toxicology Program’s 11th Report on Carcinogens categorizes <b>trichloroethylene</b> as “reasonably {{anticipated}} to {{be a human}} carcinogen”, {{based on}} limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.|$|E
25|$|The Solvents Emissions Directive 1999/13/EC and Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EC impose binding minimum {{requirements}} for emissions of <b>trichloroethylene</b> {{to the environment}} for certain activities, including surface cleaning. However, the activities with solvent consumption below a specified threshold {{are not covered by}} these {{minimum requirements}}.|$|E
25|$|Chemicals {{that have}} been linked to various forms of cancer were also discovered, as well as <b>trichloroethylene,</b> known to impair fetal development, at 50 times above safety limits {{specified}} by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2002, an inquiry by Fact-Finding Mission on Bhopal found a number of toxins, including mercury, lead, 1,3,5 trichlorobenzene, dichloromethane and chloroform, in nursing women's breast milk.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, Chief of Police Cole told a {{press conference}} that odors and {{symptoms}} reported {{may have been the}} result of pollutants or toxic waste released by nearby industrial plants, and speculated that carbon tetrachloride or <b>trichloroethylene,</b> both of which have a sweet odor and can induce symptoms similar to those reported by purported gasser victims, may have been the substance released.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed by {{a variety}} of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, <b>trichloroethylene</b> and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay {{or chemical}} change, especially {{over long periods}} of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as <b>trichloroethylene</b> (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and tetrachloroethylene used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are carcinogens themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride).|$|E
25|$|A {{plant in}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania which RCA {{operated}} {{from the late}} 1940s to June 1986, released more than 250,000 pounds of 1,1,1-trichloroethane pollutants per year from its exhaust stacks. Tests by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, found the groundwater contaminated by <b>trichloroethylene</b> (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE). In 1991 and 1992, contaminants were detected in monitoring wells {{on the east side}} of the Conestoga River in Lancaster.|$|E
25|$|The DoD {{has about}} 1,400 {{military}} properties nationwide that are contaminated with <b>trichloroethylene.</b> Many {{of these sites}} are detailed and updated by www.cpeo.org and include a former ammunition plant in the Twin Cities area. Twenty three sites in the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex — including Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the San Francisco Bay area, and NASA centers, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge are reported to have TCE contamination.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, a {{draft report}} of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{laid the groundwork for}} tough new {{standards}} to limit public exposure to <b>trichloroethylene.</b> The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy, and NASA, who appealed directly to the White House. They argued that the EPA had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.|$|E
25|$|Two {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} against a Raytheon Company plant in St. Petersburg, Florida, due to concern with health risks, property values, and contamination in April 2008. Raytheon was given {{until the end}} of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants, including <b>trichloroethylene,</b> 1,4-dioxane, and vinyl chloride. The DEP also reported that the clouds contained other toxins, such as lead and toluene.|$|E
25|$|The creek's {{water quality}} has been {{extensively}} studied in its lower watershed, below Buttermilk Falls. Most chemicals within it are within normal limits, with slightly higher levels of sulfates due to the gypsum and dolomite present in the bedrock. Those minerals also produce detectable magnesium and strontium levels as well. <b>Trichloroethylene</b> is sometimes found as well, the legacy of a spill from a railroad accident near Le Roy in the early 1970s. During high-runoff events, fecal coliform in the lower Oatka sometimes exceeds permitted levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Cole's statement, Atlas-Imperial, the primary company implicated in this affair, {{released a statement}} of its own saying that their facility had only five gallons of carbon tetrachloride in stock, which was contained in firefighting equipment. Atlas-Imperial officials also denied that any quantities of <b>trichloroethylene</b> (an industrial solvent used by Atlas) could be responsible for sickness in the town, reasoning {{that it would have}} taken significant quantities of the chemical to sicken the townspeople, and that factory workers would have experienced similar symptoms long before anybody outside of the factory was affected.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to TCE occurs {{mainly through}} {{contaminated}} drinking water. With a specific gravity greater than 1, <b>trichloroethylene</b> can be present as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment. Another {{significant source of}} vapor exposure in Superfund sites that had contaminated groundwater, such as the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant, was by showering. TCE readily volatilizes out of hot water and into the air. Long, hot showers would then volatilize more TCE into the air. In a home closed tightly to conserve the cost of heating and cooling, these vapors would then recirculate.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Raytheon {{acquired}} Dallas-based E-Systems, {{including a}} site in St. Petersburg, Florida. In November 1991, prior to Raytheon's acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds <b>trichloroethylene</b> and 1,4-Dioxane. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site. According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008 to investigate its groundwater. Contamination in the area has not affected anyone's drinking water supply or health, yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against Raytheon citing decreases in property values.|$|E
25|$|StationB, also near Warrenton, {{houses the}} {{headquarters}} of WTC and, at , is {{the largest of the}} four facilities. It consists of several multi-story buildings concealed atop the heavily forested View Tree Mountain, as well as underground bunkers that house communications infrastructure. Operations at StationB include a communications laboratory, communications training, electronics testing, and equipment maintenance. The facility is a node on a fiber-optic cable that runs from Stations C and D, and which also connects WTC with other facilities in the Washington, D.C. area, such as the Tysons Corner Communications Tower. StationB also houses the Brushwood conference facility, constructed in the 1990s. The Environmental Protection Agency classifies StationB as a superfund site due to the presence of an inactive landfill and two chemical pits that have released <b>trichloroethylene</b> into nearby residential drinking water wells.|$|E
25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and <b>trichloroethylene,</b> cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Lisle, Illinois, {{releases}} of <b>trichloroethylene</b> (TCE) had allegedly occurred on the Lockformer property beginning in 1968 and continuing for an undetermined period. The company used TCE {{in the past as}} a degreaser to clean metal parts. Contamination at the Lockformer site is presently under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois EPA. In 1992, Lockformer conducted soil sampling on their property and found TCE in the soil at levels as high as 680 parts per million (ppm). During the summer of 2000, a group of residents hired legal counsel, and on October 11, 2000, these residents had their private well water tested by a private environmental consultant. The group owned homes south of the Lockformer property in the suspected path of groundwater flow. The consultant collected a second round of well water samples on November 10, 2000, and TCE was detected in some of the wells sampled. Beginning in December 2000, Illinois EPA collected about 350 more private well water samples north and south of the Lockformer property.|$|E
