5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{published}} in serial form {{during the winter}} of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.|$|E

5|$|The Polaris {{expedition}} (1871) {{was led by}} the American Charles Francis Hall, who {{intended it}} to be the first expedition to reach the North Pole. Sponsored by the United States government, it was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> attempts at the Pole, after that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. The expedition failed at its main objective being hampered by insubordination, incompetence, and poor leadership.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{interest}} in the road came in mid-1969, when the National Park Service approved a plan to develop the facilities with Amistad. The Rough Canyon and Diablo East portions of the park were given particular focus, since {{they were the only}} two that were in existence at the time. Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, in an attempt to increase tourism.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{violation}} to {{the no-fly}} zone came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the six}} Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E

5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{attempt by}} a {{biologist}} {{to evaluate the}} likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|At this time, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> student revolts {{started to}} emerge, {{motivated}} by the local and global changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European student movement, {{the presence of the}} Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed until the new rector was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the secular authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> post-war {{studies of}} Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which {{laid out the}} themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber {{concerned the}} forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> {{consideration}} of a dam project {{was made in}} a 1954 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assessment of {{the resources of the}} Yukon and Kuskokwim River basin. Engineers considered Rampart Canyon to be a prime site for a hydroelectric dam. In April 1959, four months after President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Alaska's declaration of statehood, junior U.S. Senator from Alaska Ernest Gruening passed a resolution calling for the Corps of Engineers to begin an official study of the project, and $49,000 was allocated by the federal government for that purpose. Preliminary estimates said the project would cost $900 million (1959 dollars) and generate 4.7 million kilowatts of electricity. At the time, the largest hydroelectric project in Alaska was the Eklutna Dam, which produced just 32,000 kilowatts.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Słowacki left Switzerland and {{embarked}} on a journey that started in Italy. In Rome he met and befriended Zygmunt Krasiński, the third of the Three Bards. Krasiński is also considered <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> literary critic of Słowacki's work. Słowacki would dedicate several of his works, including Balladyna, to Krasiński. From Rome, Słowacki went to Naples and later, to Sorrento. In August he left for Greece (Corfu, Argos, Athens, Syros), Egypt (Alexandria, Cairo, El Arish) and the Middle East, including the Holy Land (Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jericho, Nazareth) and neighboring territories (Damascus, Beirut). It was a journey Słowacki described in his epic poem Podróż do Ziemi Świętej z Neapolu ("Travel to the Holy Land from Naples"); his other works of that period inclucded the poem Ojciec zadżumionych (The Father of the Plague-stricken), Grób Agamemnon (Agamemnon's Grave), Rozmowa z piramidami (A talk with the pyramids), Anhelli and Listy poetyckie z Egiptu (Poetic Letters from Egypt). In June 1837 he returned to Italy, settling briefly in Florence, and moved back to Paris in December 1838.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, {{securing}} {{his first}} full, six-year {{term in the}} Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy– Cooper's former Senate colleague– chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church {{on a series of}} amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The {{agreement}} {{to withdraw the}} special police and the JNA largely restored status quo ante bellum. 17 of the 32 arrested policemen returned to service by 5 March; charges were eventually filed against five, including Vezmar. The incident had a lasting significance because it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> skirmish in {{what would become the}} Croatian War of Independencea full-scale war between Croatia and its rebel Serb population supported by Serbia and the JNA. The Serbian government used the Pakrac clash to strengthen nationalist propaganda claims that Croatia was committing genocide against its Serb population. Up to 40 deaths from the clash were reported by Serbian and Montenegrin media outlets. In an indication of the confused and highly inaccurate nature of the reporting, the Belgrade daily newspaper Večernje novosti reported on its front page that the town's Orthodox priest had been killed, on its second page that he had been wounded, and on its third page it printed a statement from him. The Yugoslav presidency finally issued a statement that nobody had been killed in Pakrac.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant act of aggression, and if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft, and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared that the events were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{motion of}} the {{depression}} was uncertain, as steering currents could {{have resulted in a}} motion either to the west or to the north-northeast. With the possibility of the western track, the storm was remarked as being <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>serious</b> hurricane threat for southern Florida since Hurricane Gladys in 1968. However, after formation the depression moved slowly north-northeastward. The thunderstorm activity gradually became better organized while rainbands increased around the circulation. By 0000 UTC on October 18, the depression attained tropical storm status about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of the Cayman Islands, after which it was named Gilda by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm quickly strengthened as it moved toward southern Cuba, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) about 18 hours after reaching tropical storm status. Shortly thereafter, Gilda made landfall near the border of the present day Cuban provinces of Sancti Spíritus and Ciego de Ávila.|$|E
