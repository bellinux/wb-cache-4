40|$|In {{the plans}} of <b>thermo-modernisation</b> of {{historic}} buildings, strict requirements on energy performance are often relaxed. Detailed analyses are performed to select thermal upgrading technology that would ensure maximum environmental benefits while preserving the historic {{value of the}} building. The {{analysis of the costs}} of thermal upgrading with the use of heat-preserving plasters having different insulation properties is made for a coal-fired boiler plant. Optimal and advantageous ranges of insulation materials application are shown in reference to coal savings in boilers with variable and constant efficiency. Climatic conditions and environmental benefits are indicated...|$|E
