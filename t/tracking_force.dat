In 1948, the company introduced the 900MG, the first phonograph cartridge capable of playing both long-playing and 78 rpm records, and in 1954, Shure's M12 Dynetic Phono Reproducer tonearm and cartridge set established an industry standard with a <b>tracking</b> <b>force</b> of only one gram. The M1 Studio Dynetic Cartridge introduced the principle of a moving magnet within a stationary coil, an engineering concept that dominated cartridge design for nearly 25 years due to its higher output, lower noise, and greater headroom. The Shure M3D, introduced in 1958, was the first ever stereo moving magnet cartridge, with 20dB of stereo separation at 20kHz.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1940s, Shure {{was also}} {{manufacturing}} and supplying phonograph cartridges to major phonograph manufacturers including Philco, RCA, Emerson, Magnavox, Admiral, and Motorola, {{and was the}} largest producer of phonograph cartridges in the U.S. at that time. Among Shure's innovations in phonograph cartridge design was Ralph Glover and Ben Bauer's [...] "needle-tilt" [...] principle for minimizing record wear while improving sound reproduction, and Jim Kogen's engineering concept of [...] "trackability." [...] Shure produced the first phonograph cartridge capable of playing both long-playing and 78 rpm records, the first cartridge with <b>tracking</b> <b>force</b> of only one gram, and the first cartridge meeting the requirements of stereo recording. At the peak of Shure's phonograph cartridge production, the company was producing approximately 28,000 cartridges per day, with 25,000 of those coming from a Shure phonograph cartridge plant in Phoenix, Arizona. After the introduction of compact discs in the 1980s reduced the demand for phonograph cartridges, Shure closed the Phoenix facility but continued manufacturing phonograph cartridges, and continues to manufacture them today.|$|E
2500|$|Shure's {{flagship}} V15 phonograph cartridge series, {{with the}} model name referring to their 15-degree tracking angle, was established for decades as the premier cartridge for low <b>tracking</b> <b>force</b> and high tracking ability. The V-15 series also included several industry firsts: the original V-15 model (introduced in 1964) {{was the first}} to feature [...] "trackability," [...] and utilized a symmetrical, bi-radial elliptical stylus. The V-15 Type II (introduced in 1966) was the first computer-designed phono cartridge and the first to feature a flip-action built-in stylus guard. The V-15 Type IV (introduced in 1978) {{was the first to}} feature the dynamic stabilizer, which discharged static electricity from the groove and stabilized the cartridge for playback of warped records. The V-15 Type V marked the introduction of a proprietary [...] "ultra-thin wall beryllium" [...] stylus shank with a stiffness-to-mass ratio several times that of other cartridges on the market. In 1998, Sony Music Entertainment selected the Shure V15VxMR to transcribe 80 years of Columbia Records and Sony Music masters and recordings. In 2008, Gramophone Magazine awarded the V-15 an [...] "Audio Choice" [...] designation for outstanding performance and value. Due to the scarcity of the raw materials required to manufacture V-15 cartridges, Shure discontinued the series in 2004, and in June 2009, the last remaining V-15 stock was purchased by the Library of Congress.|$|E

50|$|On September 1890, {{electric}} service {{began on}} the Metropolitan Street Railway. However, horse-drawn buses were temporarily substituted circa October 1890 to May 1891. The faster, heavier electrical trams had damaged the <b>tracks</b> <b>forcing</b> a rebuild of the line.|$|R

50|$|The energy {{needed to}} {{generate}} such sound levels as were obtainable {{had to come}} directly from the stylus tracing the groove. This required very high <b>tracking</b> <b>forces</b> that rapidly wore out both the stylus and the record on lateral cut 78 rpm records.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the magnet}} {{is small and}} has little mass, and is not coupled {{mechanically}} to the generator (as in a ceramic cartridge), a properly adjusted stylus follows the groove more faithfully while requiring less <b>tracking</b> <b>force</b> (the downward pressure on the stylus).|$|E
50|$|Perhaps the SL-10's {{most unusual}} feature {{is its ability}} to play records in any position, even vertical.

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} records, {{the groove}} {{started at the}} inside of the recorded area near the label and proceeded outward toward the edge.

Within {{a research project}} at KTH Rail Vehicles a simulation model of the freight vehicle has been built up within the Multibody simulation code GENSYS. This work is defined along with the mentioned project to investigate the possible sources of RCF of the wheels {{while the number of}} damages especially in winters is considerably high. The new track model is built with both concrete and wooden sleepers. Dynamic properties of the track are set, mostly, by using measured receptances; however, PSD of the vertical <b>track</b> <b>forces</b> are also compared to tune the system. Validation of the model is done via comparing simulation and measurement. Modal analysis is performed to detect any possible resonances. The shakedown map is used to study the influence of increase in <b>track</b> <b>forces</b> on the RCF. It is shown that using concrete sleepers might be a reason of rise in the vertical <b>track</b> <b>forces</b> in winter. There might also be a resonance between the bolster of the three-piece bogie and the sleeper passing frequency as well as carbody and the hunting frequency of the vehicle.

5000|$|The Shibata-designed stylus {{offers a}} greater contact surface with the groove, {{which in turn}} means less {{pressure}} over the vinyl surface and thus less wear.

40|$|One of {{the major}} failure modes in the railway {{industry}} is wheel wear. Wheel wear affects the dynamic characteristics of vehicles and the dynamic force impact on the rail, and can in worst cases scenario cause derailment. The wheel conditions also influences the wear and required maintenance on the rail. In this paper the correlation of wear rate and dynamic force between wheel and rail is studied to specify the most costeffective wheel maintenance interval. Two cars, total of sixteen wheels, were selected. In order to calculate the wear trend, measurements have been performed, by MiniProfTM, {{for a period of}} 12 months with the cars in traffic. During the same time period, the trend of <b>track</b> <b>forces</b> from the two cars has been obtained from the research station, outside Luleå, Sweden.
