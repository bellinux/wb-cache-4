5|$|A {{ceremony}} at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. That {{was the last time}} a First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it marked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade.|$|E

5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia. A devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the early 540s marked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> age of splendour.|$|E
5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E

5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people who}} come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed {{regions of the}} pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA {{can be used in}} nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|Kaniakapūpū {{is located}} at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unmarked trail off the Pali Highway. The {{property}} is near the Luakaha Falls, {{and the surrounding area}} and trail leading up to the site are covered by a forest of invasive bamboo. Periodic clearing is necessary in order to halt the deteriorating effects of invasive root growth. The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially off-limits to the public, although state DLNR officials do not regularly monitor the site. Trespassers are subjected to citations if caught.|$|E
50|$|A flange {{can also}} be a plate or ring to form <b>a</b> rim at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pipe when {{fastened}} to the pipe (for example, a closet flange). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pipe. A flange joint is <b>a</b> connection <b>of</b> pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.|$|R

5|$|Spiritual Machines {{has been}} noted as being <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era for Our Lady Peace, {{as it was the}} last album {{produced}} by the band's longtime producer Arnold Lanni, the last to feature original guitarist Mike Turner in full, and the last studio album to feature art model Saul Fox on its cover. It was also the last album to feature Maida's high-falsetto singing voice prominently. The album peaked at number five in Canada, where it is certified double platinum.|$|E
5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win marked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era for the Giants. Parcells had grown restless as {{coach of the}} Giants and yearned for {{complete}} control of the team. Knowing that he would not get that opportunity with George Young as GM, Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|The 1990 season marked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era. After the Super Bowl, {{defensive}} coordinator Bill Belichick left to become {{head coach of}} the Cleveland Browns. Parcells also decided to leave the Giants in the spring of 1991 to pursue a career in broadcasting. In addition, there was an ownership change in what {{had been one of the}} most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, Tim Mara was diagnosed with cancer, and he sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. This marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is often seen as <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era of US highways.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable to}} take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E
2500|$|Stumps is {{also used}} as a term to mean <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day's play, e.g. [...] "The umpires called stumps" [...] means that the umpires have {{declared}} play over for the day.

5|$|The {{fall of the}} Lekapenoi signalled <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era {{in terms}} of personalities, but Kourkouas's expansionist policy continued: he was succeeded as Domestic of the Schools by Bardas Phokas the Elder, {{followed}} by Nikephoros Phokas, who reigned as emperor in 963–969, and finally, by Kourkouas's own great-nephew, John Tzimiskes, who reigned as emperor in 969–976. All of them expanded the Byzantine frontier in the East, recovering Cilicia and northern Syria with Antioch, and converting the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo into a Byzantine protectorate.|$|E
5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw {{many of the}} old {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era.|$|E
5|$|These moves {{initiated}} the Siege of Tobruk. Although isolated by land, the garrison was {{supplied by the}} Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port. This failure was significant; Erwin Rommel's front line positions at Sollum were at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies regained the initiative.|$|E
