50|$|The {{match between}} Colombia and Romania {{was the first}} game for either side in the group phase.

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is {{distinguished}} from other Oryzomys species by its short rostrum, {{the form of}} its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra. Within the species, <b>the</b> <b>Colombian</b> specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear facets of the incisors. <b>The</b> <b>Colombian</b> animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which would explain its large size and odd wear facets. There are no substantial differences between mainland O.gorgasi and material from Curaçao.|$|E
