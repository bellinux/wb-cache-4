5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is notable}} for its beach and mudflats, the danger <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> to {{individuals}} and shipping, and the efforts to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham {{is close to the}} estuary of the River Parrett where it flows into the Bristol Channel, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} early 1954. The film was {{simultaneously}} shot in Tamil as Missiamma, with an altered cast. Missamma {{tells the story}} of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: M. T. Rao and Mary. <b>They</b> <b>pose</b> as a married couple to obtain jobs in a high school founded by Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram. As Rao and Mary fall in love, Gopalam's nephew A. K. Raju (an amateur detective) learns that Mary is Gopalam's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi; she is unaware of her true identity.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
5|$|Lenormand de Mezy's {{second wife}} has {{died and the}} city has made {{remarkable}} progress. Henri Christophe is a master chef. Twenty years have gone by and Ti Noel has fathered twelve children {{by one of the}} cooks. He has told these children many stories of Macandal and they await his return. A secret gathering of trusted slaves takes place: Bouckman, the Jamaican, speaks of possible freedom for the blacks emerging in France and also mentions the opposition from the plantation landowners. An uprising is planned; {{as a result of this}} meeting, conch-shell trumpets sound and slaves, armed with sticks, surround the houses of their masters. Upon hearing the conch-shells Lenormand de Mezy is frightened and manages to hide. The slaves kill the white men and drink much alcohol. Ti Noel, after drinking, rapes Mademoiselle Floridor, who is Lenormand de Mezy's latest mistress. The uprising is defeated and Bouckman is killed. The governor, Blanchelande, advocates for the complete extermination of the colony's black population, as <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> a threat with their voodoo and secret religion. Several of the rebels are gathered to be publicly executed, but Lenormand de Mezy secures the release of his slaves, including Ti Noel, intending to sell them in the slave markets in Cuba. Lenormand de Mezy takes Ti Noel and other slaves to Cuba, where he becomes lazy, conducts no business, enjoys the women, drinks alcohol, and gambles away his slaves. Pauline Bonaparte accompanies Leclerc, her army general husband, to Haiti. On the way there, she enjoys sexually tempting the men on the ship. Solimán, a black slave, massages her body and lavishes loving care on her beauty. Leclerc develops yellow fever, and Pauline trusts in the voodoo and magic of Solimán to cure him. Leclerc dies, and Pauline returns to Paris while the Rochambeau government treats the blacks very poorly. However, there is the emergence of black priests who allow the slaves to conduct more business internally.|$|E

25|$|One type of {{pollution}} that poses considerable challenges and threats to plants is {{the concentration of}} heavy metals in the soil. Although many metals are important nutrients in small quantities, such as copper, iron and zinc, in high concentrations <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> a particularly devastating risk due to their toxicities. See Ectomycorrhizas and heavy metals for a description of how heavy metals affect ectomycorrhizal fungi.|$|E
25|$|The {{trend towards}} {{urbanization}} is accelerating. Small private wells and septic tanks that {{work well in}} low-density communities are not feasible within high-density urban areas. Urbanization requires significant investment in water infrastructure in order to deliver water to individuals and to process the concentrations of wastewater – both from individuals and from business. These polluted and contaminated waters must be treated or <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> unacceptable public health risks.|$|E
25|$|The Duke and the King are two {{otherwise}} unnamed {{con artists}} whom Huck and Jim take aboard their raft {{just before the}} start of their Arkansas adventures. <b>They</b> <b>pose</b> as the long-lost Duke of Bridgewater and the long-dead Louis XVII of France in an attempt to over-awe Huck and Jim, who quickly come to recognize them for what they are, but cynically pretend to accept their claims to avoid conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} {{chemical}} composition of these particles affects the impacts on human health. Currently coarse (diameter greater than 2.5 μm) and fine (diameter between 0.1 μm and 2.5 μm) particles are regulated, but ultrafine particles (diameter less than 0.1 μm) are currently unregulated, yet <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> many dangers. Unfortunately much is still unknown {{as to which}} kinds of particulate matter pose the most harm, which {{makes it difficult to}} come up with adequate legislation for regulating particulate matter.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl {{parathion}} and azinphos methyl, citing the risks <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> to children. Both {{methyl parathion}} and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
25|$|Competitive acro dancers {{frequently}} wear costumes when {{performing at}} dance competitions. Acro costumes often have loose fabric pieces such as short skirts, but the sizes and locations of these pieces are carefully calculated {{to ensure that}} <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> no safety risks. As an extra safety measure, skirts are sometimes pinned or stitched at the back below the waistline {{so that they will}} not hang at full length when the dancer is inverted, as in hand walking; this prevents the skirt—which might otherwise become entangled in the dancer's hair or costume headpiece—from contacting the dancer's head.|$|E

25|$|ICTS {{has used}} the {{security}} system employed in Israel, whereby passengers are profiled to assess {{the degree to which}} <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> a potential threat {{on the basis of a}} number of indicators, including age, name, origin and behavior during questioning. In the late 1990s, the firm also developed a product system based on a computerized algorithm called APS (Advanced Passenger Screening) which analyzes passenger information procured by airline companies and determines the potential risks posed by a given passenger. APS is used by most of the large airlines in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The plains zebra's major predators are {{lions and}} spotted hyenas. Nile {{crocodiles}} are also great threats during migratory river crossings. Wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards also prey on zebras, although the threats <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> are generally minor and they mostly attack the foals. Olive baboons may prey on foals, but pose {{no threat to}} adults. The zebra can be a formidable adversary, since they have a strong bite and a kick powerful enough to kill land predators. They often try to outrun larger predators such as lions and spotted hyenas, whereas they often stand their ground with the smaller predators.|$|E
25|$|Identify Fraud Initiative: The {{availability}} {{and use of}} fraudulent identification documents {{has always been a}} concern to the law enforcement community. While traditionally available from street sources, fraudulent identification and travel documents, of all types, are also readily available for sale via the Internet. In the post 9/11 world, fraudulent identity and travel documents are of an even greater concern to ICE because of the alarming threat <b>they</b> <b>pose</b> to ICE's primary mission of protecting the United States, and its citizens, from threats arising from the movement of people and goods {{into and out of the}} country. With addressing these documents and their threat in mind, the CCS has sought to identify sources for fraudulent identity and immigration documents on the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|The use of [...] "silent cops" [...] {{has been}} phased out in Australia, due {{to changes in}} the {{recommended}} method of performing turns (the introduction of the diamond turn at signalised intersections), and the hazard <b>they</b> <b>posed</b> to motorcyclists and pedestrians.|$|R
