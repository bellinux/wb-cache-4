5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, {{from which the}} uptake of palladium is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons. Seven months later a breakthrough in Britain would estimate the necessary critical mass <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 10 kilograms, making delivery of a bomb by air a possibility.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander and Dido, Queen of Carthage, both similar stories {{written in}} Shakespeare's day, are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> {{of a direct}} influence, {{although}} they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Naval Caps {{were made}} of steel gray cloth. They were not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than three inches and a half, nor more than four inches in height.

5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature, but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the size of a pixel must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E

5|$|Large {{portions}} of White Zombie were {{shot on the}} Universal Studios lot, borrowing many props and scenery from other horror films of the era. White Zombie opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting performances. While the film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> popular than other horror films of the time.|$|E
5|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Schistonchus {{are found in the}} syconia (and the {{pollinator}} wasps) of many species of fig, with F. rubiginosa hosting two species. They appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> species-specific than wasps. S. altermacrophylla is generally associated with F. rubiginosa though it has been recorded on several other fig species.|$|E
5|$|Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells. Salicylic acid is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> effective than retinoid therapy. Dry skin {{is the most}} commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.|$|E

5|$|Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this {{habitat is}} called polycalism. Polycalic species of {{termites}} form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera Apicotermes and Trinervitermes {{are known to}} have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> frequent in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of Nasutitermes.|$|E
5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England.

5|$|The likely {{presence}} of an ocean within Callisto leaves {{open the possibility that}} it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from Pioneers 10 and 11 to Galileo and Cassini have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} most {{important}} result of the raid was the technical knowledge that British scientists gained. Examination {{of the components of}} the radar array showed that it was of a modular design that aided maintenance and made fixing faults far simpler than on similar British radar models. This was confirmed during the interrogation of the captured German technician, who proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> well trained than his British counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as the album's first {{single in the}} second quarter of 2007. The track received mixed reviews from pop music critics, who generally found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> impressive than past singles. It entered the top forty in Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands, and became Bedingfield's fourth United Kingdom top ten single release. Calvin Harris covered it in 2009.|$|E
