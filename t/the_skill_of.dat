5|$|Four days later, the Dukes {{were blown}} out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders {{led the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probably}} {{outnumbered by}} a substantial margin, Julian's army won a complete victory after a hard-fought struggle. With negligible casualties of their own, the Romans drove the Alamanni beyond the river Rhine, inflicting heavy losses. Julian's force, the imperial escort army of Gaul, was small but of high quality. The battle was won by <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the Roman infantry, with the cavalry initially performing poorly.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E

5|$|The {{stage and}} the spaces set {{out in front of}} it for an {{audience}} create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised (2, 3, 6); the temporary (2); the elaborate (9); or the traditional and permanent (5, 7). They are erected indoors (3, 5, 9) or outdoors (2, 4, 6). <b>The</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft (10). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.|$|E
5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is to}} demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E

5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
5|$|Mary's son by Darnley, James, {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the {{breakdown}} of her marriage. In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers. The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced {{at the time and}} Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards. Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of unconsciousness. She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> her French physicians. The cause of her illness is unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress, haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer, and porphyria.|$|E

5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. <b>The</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 24, 1911. The film had mixed reviews from critics. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was thorough {{in the analysis of}} the film who did not like the production for its poor rehashed story and maudlin melodrama. The characters behavior was not logical and the series of events relied on deus ex machina elements, such as the Salvation Army suddenly decides to march down to the water's edge, then stop and remain in the background so that they can save his soul at the opportune moment. The reviewer did state that the acting was good. The Billboard review agreed that the story was implausible, but agreed that <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the actors made it more plausible than it otherwise would have been. The Morning Telegraph and Walton of The Moving Picture News would praise the film for its pathos and heart. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors is an {{adventure}} module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game. It was originally written for and {{used at the}} 1975 Origins1 convention.

The module, coded S1, {{was the first in}} the S-series, or special series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of D, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in Tales from the Yawning Portal. The module also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.|$|E
