500|$|The game's {{creative}} process is fluid and loosely structured. [...] According to Johnson, [...] "At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> provide the overall direction. I do {{about a quarter}} of the writing, a quarter of the coding, and almost all of the artwork." [...] The bulk of the writing is done by Nite, who also contributes design ideas, while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that the September 18 show in Honolulu {{would be the last}} performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> want to switch things around a bit. [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E

500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance {{of the kinds of}} cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E

500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{fans have}} heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, {{implying}} he is bisexual.

The {{executive director of the}} North Carolina chapter of the ACLU, Jennifer Rudinger, said [...] "it would be very difficult for a person wishing to swear on a non-Christian text to halt a courtroom proceeding to pursue a legal challenge on the issue". Mateen said [...] "Had I known that it would be taken to <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have affirmed. I could have postponed everything until they got some Qurans." [...] The ACLU was also surprised that Judge Smith cited [...] "lack of an actual controversy" [...] as a reason for dismissal because Grady Balentine, the lawyer for the state attorney general's office, did not make that argument. Balentine had only argued [...] "that the law gives people another option if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible".|$|E
