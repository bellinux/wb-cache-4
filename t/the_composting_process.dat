40|$|Abstract: Modeling <b>composting</b> <b>processes</b> is <b>the</b> {{prerequisite}} to realize <b>the</b> <b>process</b> control of <b>composting.</b> In this paper, a simulation model for domestic solid waste <b>composting</b> <b>processes</b> was developed based on microbial process kinetics, mass conservation equation, energy conservation equation and water balance. Differential equations describing microbial, substrate, oxygen concentrations, moisture content and temperature profiles were derived. Considering that several factors (temperature, oxygen, moisture and FAS) in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> interacted to <b>composting</b> <b>processes,</b> microbial biomass growth kinetics was described. In order {{to verify the}} model, a series of aerobic composting experiments on domestic solid wastes were conducted. Temperature, moisture, microbial biomass growth, oxygen consumption rate and the concentrations of organic components were monitored in <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> <b>processes</b> and also simulated with the developed model. The simulation results were well consistent with the experimental results. It also could {{be seen from the}} model that <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>composting</b> <b>processes</b> could be raised and aeration requirements could be reduced by controlling the oxygen concentration in the exhaust air within a proper range. When the range is 8 % to 12 %, the aeration requirements reduced 79. 61 %. This result was verified by <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> experiment. When initial moisture content was higher than 66 % or lower than 33 %, it would significantly reduce the rate of substrate degradation.
