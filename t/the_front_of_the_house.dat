5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still {{be seen on the}} timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been left in place. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.|$|E

5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the Brew-house below.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> on {{the ground}} floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along {{one side of the}} hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, {{with one of the}} divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E

50|$|When {{referring}} to cars, <b>the</b> left-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car is {{the side that}} corresponds with the driver's left, {{as seen from the}} driver's seat. It can also be thought <b>of</b> as <b>the</b> side that would be on the left if one was standing directly behind the car looking at it.When {{referring to}} engines, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine is the part where the pulleys for the accessories (such as the alternator and water pump) are, and <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine is where the flywheel is, through which the engine connects to <b>the</b> transmission. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine may point towards <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> side or rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. In most rear-wheel drive cars, the engine is longitudinally mounted and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine also points to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. In front-wheel drive cars with a transverse engine, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine usually points towards <b>the</b> right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. One notable exception is Honda, where many models have <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine at <b>the</b> left-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|R

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house)</b> and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built {{in the sixteenth century}} but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|His nephew, Mervyn E Hawkins, {{inherited}} the property on Mr Hawkins' death in 1956 and in 1958 he arranged a further subdivision {{of the remaining}} property into six building allotments, further reducing {{the size of the}} Granite House allotment to its present area of 1432m2. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> facing the side boundary with access now from Piddington Street.|$|E

25|$|Prominent in this {{property}} is the used of a chamfered front entrance gate.

This design, along {{with the use of a}} mirror-image chamfered design of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> proper, provided the property with a significant amount of frontal garden space, uncommon in city lots just two blocks from Ponce's main Plaza, as is the case of this house.|$|E
25|$|The home is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival {{architectural}} style. The {{house was}} built by carpenter Routt, who later became the first {{governor of the state}} of Colorado. Simple in its design, the exterior of the house has remained almost unchanged since the late 19th century, possibly before that. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and the end of its gabled roof face East Grove Street, to the south. The second story features three rectangular windows with a circular window gracing the gable end at the third floor attic.

25|$|The Nelson A. Holmes {{farmhouse}} {{sits on a}} low open hill near other farm buildings, {{including a}} wellshed, chicken coop, and summer kitchen. The farmhouse is a -story, timber-framed house with clapboard siding on a fieldstone foundation. It was constructed in 1890 around an 1884 log cabin. The flank-gable roof is covered with asphalt shingles, and a hipped roof front porch covers <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The windows are still the original double-hung, two-over-two or six-over-six panes, with dentil molding in each lintel. The summer kitchen and the chicken coop are both constructed of dovetailed logs with wooden boarding at the gable ends. The wellshed features a jerkinhead roof with exposed rafters, and is covered with narrow horizontal boards.|$|E
