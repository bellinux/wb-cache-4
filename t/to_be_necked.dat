500|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shorter <b>necked</b> and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|R

Based on this analysis, we speculate that the Kaluza-Klein black holes would be excised from the Kaluza-Klein spacetime before the onset of the Gregory-Laflamme instability and therefore before the evaporation.

50|$|The {{impeller}} <b>was</b> updated <b>to</b> a {{newly designed}} geometry using stainless steel {{material for the}} first time, {{in comparison to the}} previous aluminum design that remained the same throughout 1990-2007. The new impeller design offers large improvements in hookup as well as reduced pump cavitation. The prop driveshaft <b>was</b> changed <b>to</b> a constant diameter over the entire length to increase stiffness, versus previous years in which it <b>is</b> <b>necked</b> down <b>to</b> a smaller diameter in the center section. However, the impeller is backwards compatible with all older models and can be installed on any year SuperJet to replace the original aluminum impeller design.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{cartridge}} in the Ferguson Ace family {{shares the}} same body shape and <b>is</b> <b>necked</b> up and down for calibers from [...]20 to 6.5mm. The case body is longer and wider than the 6mm BR, has a shorter neck and a shoulder angle of 45 degrees which give it approximately 10% more powder capacity than its parent. This allows higher bullet velocities than an unimproved 6mm BR case. An example round recorded 4220fps with a 40 grain V-Max when fired from a 24" [...] pac-nor 1-11" [...] twist barrel. This performance comes {{at the cost of}} the barrel with life expectancy in around 500-600 shots.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{accumulative}} roll bonding (ARB) has <b>been</b> used <b>to</b> {{prepare the}} Al/Mg alloy multilayer structure composite materials with 1060 Al sheet and MB 2 sheet. The evolution of microstructure of the cladding materials during ARB processes was observed by optical microscope, scanning electron microscopy, and micro-hardness {{was measured by}} micro-hardness tester. The results show that a multilayer structure material of Al/Mg alloy with excellent bonding characteristics and fine grained microstructure was prepared by ARB processes. With the ARB cycles increasing, Mg alloy layer in multilayer composite material <b>was</b> <b>necked</b> and fractured, and the hardness of the Al and Mg alloy was increased.

50|$|Ceramics were an {{important}} part of the society at Tumbe. The pottery found at Tumbe is part of the Early Tana Tradition (ETT). This pottery tradition is decorated with triangles and intersecting lines. This tradition is also found in southern Tanzania, northern Kenya, southern Mozambique and the Lamu Archipelago. This connects Pemba Island with civilizations all along the East African coast. The ceramics from Tumbe are also notable in the types of vessels that were found. Many of the ceramics that have <b>been</b> found <b>are</b> <b>necked</b> jars with graphite decoration. Many of the ceramic artifacts found at Tumbe were pieces of imported pottery. The pieces were mainly from Sasanian-Islamic and Siraf storage vessels.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]416 Remington {{like the}} [...]416 Hoffman uses an {{improved}} [...]375 H&H Magnum case {{as the starting}} point.

The 8 mm Remington Magnum in turn was based on the [...]375 H&H Magnum which improved by blowing out to reducing the taper and increasing case capacity and then necking it down to accept a [...]323 in bullet. The resulting [...]416 Remington Magnum emulated the performance of the [...]416 Rigby and the [...]416 Hoffman in that like the Rigby and the Hoffman it was capable of launching a 400 gr g bullet at 2400 ft/s.|$|R

50|$|Concomitantly {{with the}} gun design, a new {{cartridge}} was developed using the standard 45 mm fragmentation shell of the 21-K anti-aircraft gun. (This projectile had a tracer that burned for eleven seconds and was fitted with the MG-8 contact fuse.) The total length of the new cartridge <b>was</b> limited <b>to</b> the same value as for the NS-37 ammunition—328mm. In order to accommodate the larger shell, the case body (brass) <b>was</b> <b>necked</b> up and also slightly reduced in length from 195 mm of the NS-37 ammunition to 185 mm. The resulting 45 mm cartridge weighted 1.93 kg, of which 1.065 kg was the weight of its shell. The muzzle velocity of the NS-45 was 780 m/s and its rate of fire was around 260-280 rounds per minute.|$|R
50|$|Obtaining a {{final product}} with high purity and {{relatively}} narrow size distribution {{is much easier}} compared to alternatives, and such powders do not require additional powder processing which may result in introduction of impurities. Aggregation is another key problem in nanopowder synthesis. Aggregates contain discrete primary particles that <b>are</b> <b>necked.</b> Particle necking refers to particles, which chemically bond together from the diffusion of atoms to the particles' interface {{in the presence of}} a driving force, such as heat. Neck formation is shown in Figure 3. A major disadvantage of vapor-fed FSP is the formation of hard agglomerates in the gas phase. As a result, it leads to difficulties in producing high-quality, bulk materials. LF-FSP largely avoids this problem by limiting aggregation through rapid quenching.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cartridge}} {{is based}} on the [...]375 Ruger case which <b>was</b> <b>necked</b> up <b>to</b> accept a [...]416 in bullet. It was designed as a dangerous game cartridge particularly for use in Alaska and Africa. The [...]416 Ruger duplicates the performance of the [...]416 Rigby and the [...]416 Remington Magnum. All three cartridge fire a 400 gr g bullet at 2400 ft/s generating [...] of energy. However, unlike the Remington or Rigby [...]416s, the Ruger [...]416 can be chambered in a standard length action as the cartridge has a length of 2.580 in. The cartridge has the same diameter of belted magnum cases but without the belt. This provides the cartridge a larger propellant capacity than a standard length magnum cartridge of the same length. The rimless design allows for the smoother feeding and extraction of the cartridge.|$|R
