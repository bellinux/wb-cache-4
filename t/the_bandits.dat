5|$|When the French colonized Madagascar in 1896, initial Betsimisaraka {{satisfaction}} {{with the fall of}} the Merina government rapidly evolved into displeasure with French control. This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka, particularly including <b>the</b> <b>bandits</b> and other outlaws who had long been living according to their own law in the eastern rainforests; the movement extended to the broader Betsimisaraka population, who mounted a strong resistance to French rule between 1897-1899. These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists.|$|E

5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. This is where he was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that what he learned by following his uncle with <b>the</b> <b>Bandits</b> has made him better both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities as a goal scorer.|$|E

5|$|In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how {{to attack}} the Ming, peasant rebellions were dangerously {{approaching}} Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader Li Zicheng breached {{the walls of the}} Ming capital, pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City. Hearing the news, Dorgon's Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (范文程; 1597–1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall. Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng's forces, Wu requested Dorgon's help in ousting <b>the</b> <b>bandits</b> and restoring the Ming.

5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of the eagle, encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing <b>the</b> <b>bandits</b> were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move, to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship. Pompey breaks all ties with Caesar and takes Cornelia as his wife. Octavia, humiliated at being used by Pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce, says she wants him dead.|$|E

50|$|Once {{initiated}} by <b>the</b> <b>bandit,</b> {{it is also}} very difficult for <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> to disengage from a flat scissors without being exposed to danger from the weapons of the other aircraft. An experienced and patient bandit {{might be able to}} turn the scissors to his advantage, however. <b>The</b> <b>bandit</b> possessing superior turning capability may also initiate a flat scissors offensively, although this is certainly a dangerous gambit (as it involves allowing the attacker to approach to close range from behind), but one that may be forced upon <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> by <b>the</b> attacking fighter's superior engine power or speed: after becoming aware of a more or less co-planar attack from his rear hemisphere, <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> uses co-planar energy techniques (using power reduction, uncoordinated flight, flaps, slats or speed brakes) without moving out of the initial plane of the attack. By remaining in the same plane of <b>the</b> attack, <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> might be able initially to deceive the attacker about the two airplanes' rate of closure, quickly placing the attacker into a position in which a successful attack cannot be made due to close proximity, too much angle-off-tail, or both; in the same circumstances, by not adopting hard evasive maneuvering, <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> might also convince the attacker to reduce speed to prevent the overshoot, (the attacker has thereby given up a major advantage in the hopes of getting a quick kill, believing that <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> has not seen him), and thereby, however, mistakenly played into the strengths of the slower but better turning bandit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vertical}} counter-maneuver {{is especially}} effective for an attacker who possesses {{an advantage in}} thrust-to-weight ratio (sometimes called [...] "power-loading") or energy over <b>the</b> <b>bandit,</b> but who conversely may have a worse instantaneous and/or sustained turn rate than <b>the</b> <b>bandit.</b> Such an attacker who recognizes that {{he is about to}} overshoot a bandit could, upon seeing <b>the</b> <b>bandit's</b> initial turn, pull up into a vertical zoom or power climb or a high yo-yo (a climbing turn {{in the same direction as}} the defender's horizontal turn). Even if the attacker has overshot <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> this vertical maneuver will help to preserve the attacker's total energy and allow the attacker at or near the top of the climb to nose down and re-establish contact with <b>the</b> <b>bandit's</b> rear quarter. <b>The</b> <b>bandit</b> at this time having probably pulled a hard turn will have lost energy as a consequence of the [...] "high-G" [...] turn. This vertical maneuver also has allowed the attacker to put distance between itself and <b>the</b> <b>bandit</b> that might serve to foil a shot due to being out of range. The attacker is now in the position to dive in for another attack, or to disengage, therefore maintaining its offensive stance. <b>The</b> <b>bandit,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, has depleted its energy in its initial turn, is below the attacker, and is possibly in a worse position than when the fight originally started. Note however that the aim of the attacker possessing an aircraft with superior power or energy, or inferior turning capabilities, is to avoid the scissors maneuver.|$|R
