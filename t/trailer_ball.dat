5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the <b>trailer</b> <b>ball.</b> This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The <b>trailer</b> <b>ball</b> is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|E
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch bike racks, cargo carriers, or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the <b>trailer</b> <b>ball,</b> and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|E

50|$|Most {{trailers}} are towed {{by joining}} {{a ball and}} a coupler (socket). The coupler {{is attached to the}} <b>trailer,</b> and the <b>ball</b> hitch is attached to the tow vehicle. The coupler slides over the ball hitch. Then, pressure is applied to a clamp, usually with a toggle or lever, which secures theball in the coupler. To ensure that the appropriate amount of pressure is applied, the coupler is equipped with a locknut that allows the operator to adjust the tension. When properly attached, the coupler will have limited movement, swiveling mainly right and left as well as tilting slightly.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, many {{pickup trucks}} come {{equipped}} with {{one to three}} mounting holes placed in the center area of the rear bumper to accommodate the mounting of <b>trailer</b> tow <b>balls.</b> The ones on the extreme left or right are often used by drivers in rural areas who tow wide farm equipment on two-lane roads. The far side mounting allows for the item (trailer, etc.) being towed to be further away from {{the opposite side of}} the road (oncoming traffic, etc.). Caution must be taken when using the bumper of a pickup truck for towing rather than using a frame mounted receiver hitch, as the bumper does not provide for as much strength and therefore is generally used to tow lighter loads. Weight ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted tow balls) and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches). Many pickup trucks without frame-mounted receiver hitches often use the rear bumper, especially if the pickup truck is a light duty (not full size) pickup truck.|$|R
50|$|The {{pivot ball}} hitch is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} trailer hitch assembly {{composed of a}} base and a <b>trailer</b> <b>ball.</b> The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer {{is attached to a}} socket coupler. A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot ball hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|E
40|$|OEM spare-tire wells have size {{limitations}} that only allow up {{to a certain}} size tire. However, the OEM tire well is not effective for the off-road enthusiast that needs an extra over size tire in case of an emergency. While off-roading {{it is important to be}} equipped with all the necessary tools and parts to get out safely because there is no roadside assistance off-road. The Jeep WJ is not a popular off road vehicle which means aftermarket accessories are not common. In order to optimize the space inside and out of the vehicle, a device is needed that will allow for the trunk space, roof rack, and trailer hitch to be free for other accessories. This device must carry an oversize spare tire, a gas tank, and at least two bikes. Thus, the objective of this project is to use skills gained in the Mechanical Engineering Technology curriculum at Central Washington University in order to design, build, and test a device that will solve this problem while optimizing available solutions. This problem was solved by the use of a curt trailer hitch multi-use receiver and the construction of a multipurpose spare tire carrier that mounts into the multi use receiver. This project was successful because it solved the problem and successfully carried an oversize spare tire, a gas can, and two bikes while being able to attach a <b>trailer</b> to the <b>ball.</b> The device was also successful because it was under the size and weight limitations...|$|R
