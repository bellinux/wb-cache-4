500|$|The European Space Agency {{operates}} Svalbard-3 (SG-3), a [...] {{dish antenna}} which {{is able to}} transmit in the S band and receive in the S and X band. ESA uses the facility for tacking, telemetry, <b>telecommand,</b> radiometric measurements and system validation. Satellites include European Remote-Sensing Satellite 2 and Envisat. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites uses SvalSat as a ground station for its MetOp satellites, which allows communication with all MetOp orbits. SvalSat serves as one of five uplink stations and as a sensor station for Galileo. Five antennas are used for Galileo, including one with a [...] diameter and four at [...]|$|E
50|$|A <b>telecommand</b> is {{a command}} sent {{to control a}} remote system or systems not {{directly}} connected (e.g. via wires) to the place from which the <b>telecommand</b> is sent. The word is derived from tele = remote (Greek), and command = to entrust/order (Latin). Systems that need remote measurement and reporting of information {{of interest to the}} system designer or operator require the counterpart of <b>telecommand,</b> telemetry. The <b>telecommand</b> can be done in real time or not depending on the circumstances (in space, delay may be of days), as was the case of Marsokhod.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telecommand</b> {{is defined}} by the Federal Communications Commission as a one-way {{transmission}} to initiate, modify or terminate functions of a device at a distance 97.3(a)(43). Control (or <b>telecommand)</b> links for a remote base station may be wire (telephone line, fiber optic line, Internet, etc.) or radio.|$|E
40|$|Internet {{telerobotics}} {{has emerged}} in recent decade with direct control and supervisory control as the main teleoperation paradigms {{in the field of}} wheeled robot navigation. It is however difficult to apply these paradigms in the unknown and dynamic real-world applications, while they do not provide adequate feeling of interaction or a human-friendly control interface to the human operator. This paper proposes a novel interactive control (active supervisory control) <b>telecommanding,</b> which is used for Internet-based mobile robot teleoperation. <b>Telecommanding</b> involves two parts: basic <b>telecommanding,</b> using joystick commands, and advanced <b>telecommanding,</b> using linguistic commands. Assisted by up-to-date data visualization and media streaming technologies, <b>telecommanding</b> can help a novice operator to simply, easily, and remotely control a robot through the Internet navigating in an unknown and dynamic real world. <b>Telecommanding</b> enables the robot to autonomously handle real-world uncertainty, improves the interactivity of humans and robot, and solve the problems of arbitrary network delays and restricted bandwidth. The experiments, including an Internet-based teleoperation test over 1500 kilometers from Beijing to Hong Kong, have demonstrated the promising performance and the advantages of this paradigm over direct control and passive supervisory control.

40|$|Internet {{telerobotics}} {{has emerged}} in recent decade with direct control and supervisory control as the main teleoperation paradigms. Both paradigms, however, are difficult to use on applications operating in the unknown and dynamic real world, while they do not provide adequate feeling of interaction or a human-friendly control interface to human operator. This paper proposes a novel interactive control (i. e., active supervisory control) paradigm: <b>telecommanding,</b> which is used for Internet-based wheeled robot teleoperation. <b>Telecommanding</b> involves two parts: basic <b>telecommanding</b> using joystick commands, and advanced <b>telecommanding</b> using linguistic commands. Each joystick or linguistic command is designed to perform an independent task and is defined with multiple events (non-time action references), and the corresponding response functions. This event-driven mechanism enables the robot to deliberately respond to expected events while to reactively respond to unexpected events. Assisted by up-to-date media streaming technologies, <b>telecommanding</b> can help a novice operator to easily control an Internet robot navigating in an unknown and dynamic real world. Experiments, including an Internet-based teleoperation test over 1500 km from Beijing to Hong Kong, demonstrate the promising performance. Department of Computin...|$|R

50|$|Another {{example is}} when {{geostationary}} communications satellites {{reach the end}} of their useful lives. Stewardship cessation will occur hopefully in a planned manner, where the operator will move the satellite to a somewhat higher orbit to minimise the risk that the satellite will be a collision hazard to other satellites in the geostationary arc (graveyard burn). Unplanned stewardship cessation will occur if <b>telecommand</b> access to the satellite's systems is cut off due to a failure, for instance in the <b>telecommand</b> receivers.|$|E

25|$|The {{data were}} {{transmitted}} by a radio link between Huygens and Cassini provided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe's mission {{could not be}} <b>telecommanded</b> from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).|$|R
2500|$|The {{communications}} subsystem {{is composed}} of 3 antennas: A 1.6 m diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna and two omnidirectional antennas. The first one provide links (<b>telecommands</b> uplink and telemetry downlink) in both [...] X-band (8.4GHz) and S-band (2.1GHz) and is used during nominal science phase around Mars.

The core network {{comprises}} 9 stations in seven countries: Kourou (French Guiana), Maspalomas, Villafranca and Cebreros (Spain), Redu (Belgium), Santa Maria (Portugal), Kiruna (Sweden), Malargüe (Argentina) and New Norcia (Australia). Operators are on duty at ESOC 24 hours/day, year round, to conduct tracking passes, uploading <b>telecommands</b> and downloading telemetry and data.|$|R
30|$|TC links are {{currently}} evolving to include {{new and more}} challenging mission profiles, characterized by much more demanding requirements. Compliance with these new requirements imposes the use of more advanced coding techniques than the BCH(63, 56) code. In space <b>telecommanding,</b> it is always of fundamental importance to ensure the integrity of very short emergency commands, with a very low data rate and limited latency. Such constraints impose the adoption of short codes.|$|R
30|$|Reliable space <b>telecommanding</b> is of {{fundamental}} importance as {{the success of}} a mission may be compromised because of an error corrupting a TC message. This imposes strict constraints on the maximum tolerable error rates. In particular, the codeword error rate (CER) is defined as the ratio of the number of decoding failures to the total number of received codewords. Requirements are often specified in terms of average CER, and a typical value is CER ≤ 10 − 5.|$|R
5000|$|The Marsokhod was a [...] heavy Soviet rover (hybrid, {{with both}} {{controls}} <b>telecommand</b> and automatic) aimed at Mars, {{part of the}} Mars 4NM and scheduled to be released (after 1973 according to the plans of 1970) launched by a N1 rocket that never arrived to fly successfully.|$|E
5000|$|Kourou Station (also {{known as}} Kourou 93) is an ESTRACK {{satellite}} ground station in French Guiana.

50|$|Telemetry is an {{automated}} communications {{process by which}} measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.
