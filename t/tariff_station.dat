50|$|At {{the former}} Roman <b>tariff</b> <b>station,</b> near the Maag and Linth rivers between Lake Walen and Lake Zürich, a Mercury (mythology) statue was found. The {{center of the}} village is {{situated}} on {{the territory of the}} canton of Glarus around Fritz & Caspar Jenny AG, a spinning and weaving factoring established in 1833, and {{which is part of the}} Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. The vocational school of Glarus is also situated in the Glarus part of Ziegelbrücke. On the side of the canton of St. Gallen, Ziegelbrücke railway station is located; around 70 people are living and working there.|$|E
50|$|A {{system of}} single-part tariffs was in vogue in India for pricing of thermal power, prior to 1992. The single-part <b>tariff</b> for a <b>station</b> was {{calculated}} to cover both the fixed cost {{as well as}} the variable (energy) cost at a certain (normative) generation level.|$|R
5000|$|The station, and all {{of those}} west of Elwyn station, was closed in September 1986, due to deteriorating track {{conditions}} and Chester County's desire to expand facilities at Exton station on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. Service was [...] "temporarily suspended" [...] at that time, with substitute bus service provided. Darlington station still appears in publicly posted <b>tariffs.</b> Darlington <b>Station</b> was named after the dairy located at that place. For years it was a flag stop, but was abandoned and then re-established. However, Darlington Station was demolished shortly after service ended. The concrete curb for the platform edge and the access road are all that remain.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 1994, M/s ECC of USA were {{commissioned}} under {{a grant from}} Asian Development Bank to undertake a comprehensive study of the Indian power system and recommend a suitable tariff structure.ECC submitted their report in February, 1994, recommending Availability <b>Tariff</b> for generating <b>stations,</b> which was accepted in principle by GOI in November, 1994. A National Task Force (NTF) was constituted by the Ministry of Power in February, 1995 to oversee the implementation of ECC’s recommendations. Based on NTF deliberations between 1995 and 1998, Ministry of Power had crystallized the formulation for the so-called Availability-based tariff (ABT).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} optimisation of {{pump and}} valve schedules in complex large-scale water distribution networks (WDN). An optimisation model is automatically generated in GAMS language from a hydraulic model in EPANET format and from additional files describing operational constraints, electricity <b>tariffs</b> and pump <b>station</b> configurations. The paper describes how each hydraulic component is modelled. To {{reduce the size}} of the optimisation problem the full hydraulic model is simplified using module reduc- tion algorithm, while retaining the nonlinear characteristics of the model. Subsequently, a nonlinear programming solver CONOPT is used to solve the optimisation model. The proposed approached was tested on a large-scale WDN model provided in EPANET format. The considered WDN included complex structures and interactions between pump stations. Solving of several scenarios considering different horizons, time steps, operational constraints and topological changes demonstrated ability of the approach to automatically generate and solve optimisation problems for variety of requirements...|$|R

It is dedicated to advancing the role and increasing the effectiveness of campus and community radio in Canada. It works closely with other regional, national, and international radio organizations to: provide developmental materials and networking services to its members, represent {{the interests of the}} sector to government (particularly the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)) and other agencies, and promote public awareness and appreciation for community-oriented radio in Canada. Since 1981, it has affected changes to national radio policy, helped lower <b>tariffs</b> affecting radio <b>stations,</b> and has helped stations open doors while preventing others from closing. Core initiatives include GroundWire, Dig Your Roots, !earshot, Women’s Hands and Voices, the Community Radio Fund of Canada, sector-wide listservs, and an annual radio conference. The NCRA recognizes the cultural and social diversity of the Canadian population and is committed to facilitating the expression of this diversity and vitality within the campus and community radio broadcasting sector.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} optimisation of {{pump and}} valve schedules in complex large-scale water distribution networks (WDN), {{taking into account}} pressure aspects such as minimum service pressure and pressuredependent leakage. An optimisation model is automatically generated in the GAMS language from a hydraulic model in the EPANET format and from additional files describing operational constraints, electricity <b>tariffs</b> and pump <b>station</b> configurations. The paper describes in details how each hydraulic component is modelled. To {{reduce the size of}} the optimisation problem the full hydraulic model is simplified using module reduction algorithm, while retaining the nonlinear characteristics of the model. Subsequently, a nonlinear programming solver CONOPT is used to solve the optimisation model, which {{is in the form of}} Nonlinear Programming with Discontinuous Derivatives (DNLP). The results produced by CONOPT are processed further by heuristic algorithms to generate integer solution. The proposed approached was tested on a large-scale WDN model provided in the EPANET format. The considered WDN included complex structures and interactions between pump stations. Solving of several scenarios considering different horizons, time steps, operational constraints, demand levels and topological changes demonstrated ability of the approach to automatically generate and solve optimisation problems for a variety of requirements...|$|R
