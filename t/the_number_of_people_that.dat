25|$|In 1937, in {{an attempt}} to expand <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> could be involved, the OBP experimented by {{attempting}} to hold three separate parliaments around the province, instead of the one in Victoria. As a result of the hiatus during World War II, and the effort to rebuild the OBP in the late 1940s, no real thought was given to regional parliaments until the 1960s. During the late 1960s, into 1970, the Older Boys' Parliament made efforts to establish a regional program, but a program of regional parliaments never came to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Produced as a {{side project}} by Kial Natale, Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub, the concept {{originated}} in December 2008 from the desire to produce a live-action version of a series, with Natale wishing to focus on Grand Theft Auto, and Majdoub suggesting a film based upon Dragon Ball Z. After {{another member of the}} group suggested Pokémon as a possibility, they focused on that concept instead. Kial quickly wrote a script for the short film, while Majdoub and executive film producer Innes contributed additional material to flesh it out. Originally intended to be a film in the vein of CollegeHumor's parody productions, more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to Kial's love for the series and his desire for the film to be [...] "more and more". Planning of the film took four months, while filming and production took a year and a half. Varying crew sizes were used for the four different filming periods with the majority of filming occurring within one weekend. Majdoub noted he was surprised at <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> came forth for auditions that were not actors, but fans of the series.|$|E
500|$|On a {{slightly}} less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to get on to the next phase." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking [...] "since <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> had the power and knowledge {{to do this kind of}} thing was low." [...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E

40|$|Reliable people {{counting}} {{and human}} detection {{is an important}} problem in visual surveillance. In recent years, the field has seen many advances, but the solutions have restrictions: people must be moving, the background must be simple, and the image resolution must be high. This paper aims to develop an effective method for estimating <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and locate each individual in a low resolution image with complicated scenes. The contribution {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, postprocessing steps are performed on background subtraction results to estimate <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in a complicated scene, which includes people who are moving only slightly. Second, an Expectation Maximization (EM) -based method has been developed to locate individuals in a low resolution scene. In this method, a new cluster model is used to represent each person in the scene. The method does not require a very accurate foreground contour. Third, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> is used as a priori for locating individuals based on feature points. Hence, the methods for estimating <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and for locating individuals are connected. The developed methods have been validated based on a 4 -hour video, with <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in <b>the</b> scene ranging from 36 to 222. The best result for estimating <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> has an average error of 10 % over 51 test cases. Based on <b>the</b> estimated <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> some results <b>of</b> the EM-based method have also been shown. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|Measuring the {{prevalence}} of homosexuality presents difficulties.
