Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors {{that have been}} found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others.

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service <b>to</b> <b>employers.</b> According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration <b>to</b> <b>employers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{have shown}} that returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure in Indonesia are {{higher than in the}} USA and other {{developed}} countries. By contrast, returns to experience are lower in Indonesia than in developed countries. Furthermore, in Indonesia, returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure are larger than returns to experience, and our estimates of returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure are unaffected when we account for returns to other types of human capital, such as occupation and industry-specific human capital. As in many developing countries, informality is quite prevalent in Indonesia. We test for returns to sector-specific human capital and find that only formality offers positive returns. Overall, we conclude that employer tenure and formal sector tenure are the main sources of wage growth in Indonesia, with general labor market experience playing a smaller but significant role.|$|R

30|$|Unlike Altonji and Shakotko’s {{estimates}}, our IV {{estimates of}} the returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure are higher than our OLS estimates. Why are OLS returns to tenure upward biased in the USA and downward biased in Indonesia? We must remind ourselves that the IV strategy we used corrects for bias due to match-specific components. In the USA, OLS {{estimates of the}} returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure (after accounting for potential labor market experience) are higher than IV estimates. This suggests that old jobs have higher match-specific components than new jobs: {{part of the reason}} why high tenure jobs pay more is that they are better matches. By contrast, in Indonesia, IV estimates of returns to tenure are higher than OLS estimates, suggesting that old jobs have lower match-specific components than new jobs. This would arise if there are high returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure or if employer switching is generally costly. Indeed, if there are high returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure, there are high opportunity costs <b>to</b> switching <b>employers.</b> Therefore, workers will only switch <b>to</b> a new <b>employer</b> if wages are high enough to compensate them for any costs of employer switching, i.e., the match-specific component in the new job is higher than in the old job. Consistent with the idea that employer switching is costly in Indonesia, job mobility in Indonesia is lower than in the USA or even in Mexico (Maloney, 1999). Overall, OLS estimates are downward biased in Indonesia and upward biased in the USA because employer switching is more costly in Indonesia.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} the returns <b>to</b> <b>employer,</b> occupation, industry, and sector tenure in Indonesia. We use the instrument developed by Altonji and Shakotko (1987) {{and used by}} Parent (2000) and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) to estimate returns to tenure using the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS). The panel structure of the data allows us to construct respondents’ employment history between 1988 and 2007. We find that the 10 -year return <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure is 24 % and the returns to potential experience are 18 %. Once we include occupation, industry, and sector tenure, {{we find that the}} returns <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> tenure and potential experience remain significant and of similar magnitude, while there is no significant return to sector tenure. However, when we allow the returns in the formal sector to differ from the returns in the informal sector, we find that the returns are much higher in the formal sector. All else equal, the 10 -year return to formal sector tenure is 35 %, while there is no significant return to tenure in the informal sector.|$|R
