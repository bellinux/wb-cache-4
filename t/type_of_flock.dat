40|$|In South Africa {{from early}} 1989 onward, strains of Haemophilus paragallinarum not {{requiring}} {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) have been isolated from commercial chickens suffering from infectious coryza. Fifteen of these field isolates were characterized by biochemical typing, serotyping, restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), and ribotyping. The chosen isolates represented diversity in geographic location, time of disease outbreak, and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>flock.</b> All were typical of the species in biochemical properties, except that they were NAD-independent, and all were Page serovar A. REA was performed with three enzymes: HindIII, HpaII, and SspI. All isolates gave identical REA profiles with all three enzymes. Ribotyping was performed using a probe that consisted of the plasmid pUC 19 into which the 16 S rRNA operon of H. paragallinarum had been inserted. All 15 isolates gave the same ribotyping profile using {{each of the three}} enzymes. As a group, the NAD-independent strains gave REA profiles and ribotypes that were very different from a range of classic South African strains isolated before 1989. Our results strongly suggest that the NAD-independent isolates are clonal in nature...|$|E

No low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus was isolated from 47 seropositive flocks that lacked clinical signs during sampling. The unadjusted percentage of seroprevalence rates of layer and broiler flocks were not significantly different, i. e., 26 % (25 / 96) and 23 % (22 / 97), respectively. The HI titer of the layers (mean = 89) was higher than the broilers (mean = 36; p < 0. 001). A cross-sectional study was conducted for the seroprevalence of LPAI in the layers. Of 7 risk factors, farms employing one or more workers had a higher seropositive prevalence as compared to farms without hired employees (adjusted prevalence OR = 11. 5, p = 0. 031). Layer flocks older than 400 d had higher seropositivity than flocks younger than 300 d (OR = 4. 9, p = 0. 017).

40|$|Sixty-three of 435 (14. 5 %) samples {{collected}} from broiler chickens were positive for C. jejuni. Twenty-two of 55 samples were from organic chickens (40 %) and 41 of 380 samples were from conventional chickens (10. 8 %). Isolates {{were subjected to}} macrorestriction profiling using SmaI and analyzed {{for their ability to}} survive in macrophage cells and invade in epithelial cells. Antibiotic testing to cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, trimethroprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin were performed. Finally, 5 isolates of varying putative in vitro virulence traits were chosen for experimental inoculation of newborn piglets. Five piglets per isolate were tested and examined macroscopically and microscopically upon necropsy. Genotyping of isolates indicated 1 to 3 profiles per flock. Of the 22 organic isolates from chickens, only 3 (13. 6 %) were able to survive within macrophages. For the conventional isolates, 21 out of 41 (51. 2 %) were able to survive. However, the majority of isolates (90. 5 %) from both organic and conventional isolates were not capable of invading epithelial cells. No isolates exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. One isolate out of 63 (1. 6 %) was resistant to erythromycin, 52 (82. 5 %) to tetracycline, 28 (44. 4 %) to trimethroprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 6 (9. 5 %) to cefaclor. In terms of the piglet studies, regardless of the combination of in vitro invasion or survival results or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>flock,</b> most piglets (16 / 25) in all groups exhibited hyperemia, edema, and hemorrhage in the small intestine or colon upon gross examination. Microscopic examination revealed congested mucosa and erosion of the epithelium in 10 of the 25 piglets from 4 of the 5 groups. In conclusion, this study suggests that C. jejuni isolated from broiler chickens are virulent in piglets and are probably capable of causing disease in humans. Furthermore, the results of the survival and invasion assays did not correlate with the results of the piglet studies and cannot be relied upon to predict degree of virulence. Therefore, another virulence factor is responsible for the pathogenesis, such as a toxin(s). As this is the first study to confirm putative in vitro virulence traits with an animal model, further research is recommended with the piglet model to assess pathogenicity...|$|E
40|$|By far the {{greatest}} {{proportion of the}} 1, 150, 000 acres of light land in Canterbury is found on the Canterbury Plain. This plain, originally covered by "low tussock" and of easy contour, was enticing to the early pioneers {{and became one of}} the earliest areas in New Zealand to be settled and farmed. Over the years it has developed {{into one of the most}} intensively farmed and productive areas of New Zealand. The dominant characteristic of the light land of Canterbury is undoubtedly the climate. The rainfall is reasonably evenly distributed over the year, but because of the low humidity, high temperatures and warm winds experienced over the summer in association with a free draining soil, the effectiveness of the rainfall over this period is drastically reduced. Consequently active plant growth is severely restricted for several months over the summer, and occasionally extends into the spring and/or autumn periods. The uncertainty as to the length and severity of this restricted growth period and the associated problem of equating the variable feed supply to the stock requirements, both within and between years, is the basic problem confronting the light land farmer. In spite of the environmental difficulties the productivity of the light land has increased several fold since early settlement. The original holdings on the Canterbury Plain were large with their boundaries on the rivers so as to provide access to water. Fine wool sheep were extensively grazed. However the introduction of refrigerated shipping and the extension of the water race system in the 1880 's brought about a reduction in the size of holdings and a change in the pattern of farming. Dual purpose sheep were run and by the 1930 's in response to favourable crop prices the system of diversified farming was firmly established. Unfortunately this system placed excessive emphasis on cash cropping, particularly on the light soils. Soil fertility was drained, structure severely damaged and subsequent pasture establishment and survival poor. In the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, with declining crop yields and with more favourable prices being obtained for fat lambs and particularly wool, the emphasis shifted from cropping to livestock farming. The carrying capacity however, was restricted by the reduced soil fertility and poor quality pastures and an environment in which climatic uncertainty tended to inhibit the rapid expansion of stock numbers. The results of research work carried out at the various institutions in Canterbury over the years have undoubtedly promoted a greater understanding and appreciation of the problems confronting the farmer and the limitations of the particular environment in which he must operate. For example, pasture species more suited to the low fertility conditions and climate were introduced with spectacular results. The most significant of these was subterranean clover (introduced in the 1930 s), noted for its ability to withstand the summer droughts, to regenerate in the autumn, and to provide an increased bulk of feed in the spring. Research work had shown that both lime and phosphate were necessary on the light land soils, if high pasture production and persistency was to be expected. Soil fertility increased subsequent to a reduction in the emphasis on cropping and with the higher levels of fertiliser application. High fertility pasture species (e. g. white clover and lucerne), were introduced and not only gave higher and more reliable total production but exhibited improved seasonal spread of production. Investigations into pasture diseases and stock health provided answers to specific problems. Research into flock management generally and in comparisons between the productivity of various sheep breeds indicated the most suitable <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> and breed for the light land farmer. From this and other research work (in conjunction with the observations of leading farmers in the area), an efficient system of light land farming has gradually evolved in which many of the basic problems have been overcome and which has resulted in a raising of the carrying capacity of the light land from ¾ stock unit per acre in the 1930 's to 3 ½- 4 stock units per acre at present. A central feature of this system (particularly at high stocking rates), is the high degree of flexibility incorporated in both the stock policies and feed supplies. Where the objective function is to maximise productivity over a period of years, it is essential to utilise the available spring feed efficiently while maintaining the ability to destock when confronted with feed shortages in the spring and early summer. Because of the fluctuating feed supply, which is characteristic of light land, the need to maintain feed reserves and to incorporate a high degree of flexibility in the stock policy is evident if the feed supply and demand are to be equated. In summary, the increased productivity can be attributed to two factors: (1) The ability to grow a greatly increased quantity of herbage per acre with an improved seasonal pattern of production. (2) A more efficient utilisation of the herbage produced. Unlike his counterpart in more reliable farming districts, the light land farmer operates in an environment of uncertainty. Yield uncertainty, particularly at high stocking rates, is the major problem to be overcome and this dictates very largely the system of farming adopted. Price uncertainty is also a significant aspect of light land farming because of the reliance on a limited range of products and the inability to diversify. In an analysis of physical and financial data collected from a sample of light land farms in Canterbury (1) there was no evidence to suggest that any one particular pattern of output was superior to all others. This result was surprising, but may reflect the uncertainty inherent in the environment. (1) For a full discussion on this, see Section 3. 3. 2 (a). Alternatively it may infer that the actual patterns of production are less important than the managerial skill with which they are implemented. These results pointed to the need to explore more fully the following facets of light land management: (1) Given a developed farm, is there any one optimal pattern of production which (a) generates increased profit under average seasonal and price conditions, and (b) is subject to only small variations in profit under changing seasonal and price conditions? (2) Given the potential for the development and expansion of light land farming, how profitable is this from the individual farmer's viewpoint? If, in an evaluation of the first problem, high levels of productivity are shown to be profitable on existing well developed farms, then a reallocation of resources to obtain the desired combination should be recommended. An optimum combination of enterprises shown by such an analysis might well serve as the goal where an undeveloped potential still exists on a farm and where a reallocation and intensification in the use of resources is necessary if productivity is to be increased. In this study of light land farming two case farms have been used and although the results refer specifically to these particular farms, some conclusions of a general nature are possible. In Chapter II the physical characteristics of the area are described. In Chapter III a review of the research into specific problems relating to the management of light land is presented. This is followed in Chapter IV by an explanation of the technical principles of light land farming which have evolved. Chapter V is devoted to the comparison of some of the production possibilities open to the light land farmer using linear programming. An analysis of light land development 1 s presented in Chapter VI, while Chapter VII presents the conclusions and summary of the study...|$|E

The relationships between management practices and diseases of lambs which were associated with production were also investigated using discriminant analysis. Flocks in the maritimes had a lower average flock productivity than those in Ontario-Quebec and the western provinces. In purebred flocks, the average adjusted weight at 100 days of age was higher than in other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocks,</b> and the prevalence of scours was lower. At the herd level, the rates of pregnancy toxemia and vaginal prolapse were associated with heavier lambs, while the average daily weight gain between 50 and 100 days of age was lower in herds affected by scours and starvation. Using pasture and bush as winter housing was also detrimental to lamb productivity. No management practices discriminated between case and control flocks for scours and starvation in lambs. It was concluded that {{the reasons for the}} geographic differences should be investigated as should the management differences between purebred and other producers.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of various tracking technologies (such as RFID, Bluetooth, Wifi, and GPS), high-resolution movement data {{is getting more}} convenient to be acquired. Consequently, the research towards such data gains much attention. Typically, various movement patterns of birds, animals, pedestrains and vehicles are analysed. In this work, we will focus on one typical movement pattern, namely flocks. Flocks can be stationary or moving. Currently, more attentions is paid to moving flocks, since it usually represents the collective behaviours of groups (i. e., {{a group of people}} moving closely together for a certain time period), which can have many meaningful applications in practice. Firstly, we propose a novel algorithm ‘Reeb Graph based Moving Flocks discovery algorithm’, which is shorted as RGMF, for the discovery <b>of</b> moving <b>flocks.</b> Secondly, we develop a taxonomy for moving flocks and apply RGMF to the discovery <b>of</b> all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>flocks</b> that are derived from the taxonomy. Generally, the algorithm consists of two major procedures: (1) the construction of a Reeb graph from moving objects data, and (2) the discovery <b>of</b> moving <b>flocks</b> from the constructed Reeb graph. When constructing a Reeb graph, we firstly synchronize the raw moving objects data {{in order to get a}} set of interpolated data where for every moving object the positions are recorded at every interpolated timestamp; then we abstract the moving objects that are with the same timestamp in the interpolated data to 1, 2 or 3 node(s) in Reeb graph according to some rules; finally the connections of all generated nodes are determined according to whether these nodes have common moving objects involved or not. When discovering moving flocks, five basic steps are executed firstly towards the constructed Reeb graph: merging, splitting, filtering, deletion, and extraction. After these five steps, a collection of sub-graphs is generated, each of which is considered as the candidate of one or more <b>types</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>flocks.</b> Subsequently, all derived <b>types</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>flocks</b> are discovered respectively from the candidates using RGMF.

Besides, we compare RGMF with another algorithm at the end to find out the pros and cons for both algorithms...|$|R

Virágh applied agent-based models {{to the control}} <b>of</b> <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> UAVs, incorporating principles of time delay in communication as well as inaccuracy of onboard sensors. Two decentralized algorithms are proposed in their research: one based on the collective motion <b>of</b> a <b>flock,</b> the other based on collective target tracking. A principle of their research {{is to use a}} realistic simulation framework to study the group behavior of autonomous robots.|$|R
