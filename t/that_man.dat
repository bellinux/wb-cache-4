5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial Ligament of Struthers {{came to the attention of}} Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case <b>that</b> <b>man</b> and other mammals shared a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals <b>that</b> <b>man</b> has {{introduced into the}} environment. They can appear inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This is serious because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} me {{sufficient}} to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies <b>that</b> <b>man</b> must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E
50|$|Sonja B. Starr {{conducted}} {{a study in the}} US that found that the prison sentences <b>that</b> <b>men</b> serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Starr does not believe <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are disadvantaged generally. Men's rights advocates have argued <b>that</b> <b>men</b> being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder is evidence <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes.|$|R
50|$|Data from 1994 in the U.S. {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> make up 94% {{of workplace}} fatalities. Masculist Warren Farrell has argued <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are often clustered in dirty, physically demanding and hazardous jobs in an unjustifiably disproportionate manner.|$|R
50|$|Other {{studies have}} also found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> tend to {{demonstrate}} a greater response to competition as compared to women. Using a publics-goods game, Van Gugt, De Cremer and P.Janssen found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> contributed more to their group {{in the face of}} outside competition from another group. There was however no distinct difference amongst womenâ€™s contributions. From this it can be inferred <b>that</b> <b>men</b> would show higher in-group favouritism and out-group hostility than women.|$|R
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and <b>that</b> <b>man</b> stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 it says <b>that</b> <b>man</b> {{is made from}} the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing <b>that</b> <b>man</b> was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E
60|$|This example alone proves <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{who are not}} {{scholars}} {{venture to}} pronounce on Shakespeare's scholarship, and <b>that</b> <b>men</b> who take absurd statements at second hand dare to constitute themselves judges of a question of evidence and of erudition.|$|R
50|$|In this, men are {{basically}} contradicting themselves {{because they say}} women cannot do an activity and want {{to stop them from}} doing it. Here Mill suggests <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{are basically}} admitting that women are capable of doing the activity, but <b>that</b> <b>men</b> do not want them to do so.|$|R
50|$|Sonja B. Starr {{conducted}} a study that found <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> serve, on average, 63% longer prison sentences than women when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Sonja B. Starr denies <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are disadvantaged generally in criminal justice. Warren Farrell identifies 12 criminal defenses that are only available to women. Men's rights advocates have argued <b>that</b> <b>men</b> being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder is evidence <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes. The National Coalition for Men states that killing a female rather than a male causes a larger sentence length, {{even more than the}} increase observed by killing a white person rather than a black person.|$|R
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed <b>that</b> <b>man</b> is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises <b>that</b> <b>man</b> is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is {{likened to}} a wicked man who oppresses others. The fox is likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly man, {{with whom the}} fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods <b>that</b> <b>man</b> longs to get. The cheese {{represents}} covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men downwards into hell.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} believe <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are usually more satisfied than women with their physical appearance. Other researchers, however, state <b>that</b> <b>men</b> still struggle with body image. Men {{believe that they}} are either too thin or too heavy and therefore do not meet the male ideal body type of lean and muscular.|$|R

25|$|Complementarians support both {{equality}} and beneficial {{differences between men}} and women. They believe the Bible teaches <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women have distinct complementary roles in both marriage and in the church. They maintain <b>that</b> <b>men</b> have a responsibility to lead and women have a responsibility to submit to the leadership of men.|$|R
5|$|After {{thinking}} {{a bit more}} about Emile and deciding she has become attracted {{on the basis of}} little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him ("I'm Gonna Wash <b>That</b> <b>Man</b> Right Outa My Hair"). When he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, however, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings ("I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy").|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>man</b> is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need}} for contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World <b>that</b> <b>Man</b> Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, it was alleged <b>that</b> <b>Manning</b> was {{the focus}} of {{poltergeist}} activity. He started performing automatic drawing and writings. Covering his bedroom walls appeared over six hundred signatures spanning six centuries. It was noted at the time <b>that</b> <b>Manning</b> had been researching history as part of his school work. According to Joe Nickell who made an in-depth study of Manning's writings, they contain internal inconsistencies and the [...] "signatures" [...] are completely inaccurate for historical individuals. Nickell concluded <b>that</b> <b>Manning</b> has [...] "traits associated with a fantasy-prone personality" [...] and there is no evidence he possesses genuine paranormal powers.|$|R

5|$|In June 2013, David S. Goyer {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Man</b> of Steel is {{the first}} film in the DC Extended Universe. This confirmed that should the Green Lantern property be featured in an upcoming DC film, {{it will be a}} rebooted version. Later that year Goyer stated that he had interest in making a new feature film based on the titular character. In July 2015, Warner Bros announced plans to release a solo Green Lantern film titled Green Lantern Corps, with a release date scheduled for June 19, 2020. The film will be the eleventh installment of the DC Extended Universe. Hal Jordan and John Stewart will reportedly be the Green Lanterns focused on in the movie. In January 2016, it was reported that Goyer and Justin Rhodes will be writing the film's script and will also produce the film, with Geoff Johns and Jon Berg as executive producers.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; <b>that</b> <b>man</b> was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position <b>that</b> <b>man</b> was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creationâ€“evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
50|$|Early theorists {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{were better}} eyewitnesses than women. This belief began with William Stern, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>men</b> were better at remembering details and {{less susceptible to}} misleading information than women. However, subsequent studies challenged Sternâ€™s findings. Several contemporary findings show that overall; there are no significant gender differences in eyewitness memory.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{men and women}} perceive online and offline sexual and emotional infidelity. Undergraduates from a large university in Northern Ireland participated in the study. It was found <b>that</b> <b>men,</b> when forced to decide, were more upset by sexual infidelity and women by emotional. It was also found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{were more likely to}} believe that women have sex when in love and that women believe <b>that</b> <b>men</b> have sex even when they are not in love. It was not, however, found <b>that</b> either <b>men</b> or women believed that having cybersex implied the other was also in love or that being in love online implied they were having cybersex.

5|$|On 21 April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson {{ordered the}} {{occupation}} of Veracruz. MacArthur joined the headquarters staff that {{was sent to the}} area, arriving on 1 May 1914. He realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of railroad cars in Veracruz but no locomotives, MacArthur set out to verify a report that {{there were a number of}} locomotives in Alvarado, Veracruz. For $150 in gold, he acquired a handcar and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only switchers, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, his party was set upon by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed. One of his companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party was attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but his men, using their handcar, managed to outrun all but one of their attackers. MacArthur shot both <b>that</b> <b>man</b> and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.|$|E
