25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let me {{tell you}} (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story in her own words, in the literal sense that she can use only <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of events leading up to {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
25|$|When Genie {{left the}} Riglers' house in mid-1975, {{at the age}} of 18, she had {{acquired}} a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and her progress remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. And how much of what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E

500|$|Kipling {{began working}} on the book by telling the first three {{chapters}} as bedtime stories to his daughter Josephine. These had to be told [...] "just so" [...] (exactly in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> was used to) or she would complain. The stories describe how one animal or another acquired its most distinctive features, such as how the Leopard got his spots. For the book, Kipling illustrated the stories himself.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{sees the}} return of River Song, {{the woman from the}} Doctor's future who was {{previously}} seen in [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] takes place in her relative past, where she is a doctor, having not yet become a professor. She shows the ability to fly the TARDIS, which she says she learned from [...] "the best" [...] and then teases the Doctor it was not him. (In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", it will be shown that the TARDIS taught her to fly it.) In addition, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> inscribed on the home box in Old High Gallifreyan ("Hello, Sweetie!") are the same words by which she greets the Tenth Doctor in [...] "Silence in the Library". The crash of the Byzantium was first mentioned in [...] "Silence in the Library", when River asks the Tenth Doctor, after consulting her diary, if they've done that yet.|$|E
500|$|The clips {{differ from}} one another in terms of Lennon's attire {{and the nature of}} Ono's role as, in author Robert Rodriguez's description, [...] "an onstage focal point around which all {{activity}} was staged"; in addition, Lennon's vocal was treated with echo for the 19 February broadcast. In the [...] "knitting" [...] clip, Lennon is wearing a black polo-neck jumper as Ono sits beside his piano, blindfolded, and knitting throughout. In [...] "cue card", Lennon wears a flower-pattern shirt under a denim jacket, while Ono holds up a series of cryptically worded cue cards, the messages on which include [...] "Smile", [...] "Hope" [...] and [...] "Peace", as she speaks into a microphone. Although Ono appears to have a more active role, she is again blindfolded and <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> speaks cannot be heard. Rodriguez describes both clips as [...] "terrifically engaging, providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song", yet he considers that the [...] "cue card" [...] performance [...] "captures much more of the ambience, with frequent shots of White's stellar work and the studio dancers".|$|E

60|$|Memory was <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> used, {{as if all}} {{my youth}} were fled. I suppose I really am quite elderly.|$|R

500|$|In 2013, Disney {{released}} a digitally remastered Diamond Edition of The Little Mermaid on Blu-ray/DVD. Some {{fans of the}} film noticed that an error had occurred during the remastering process that resulted in two brief segments from the [...] "Part of Your World" [...] sequence to play in reversed order, appearing in the opposite order {{of the way in}} which they appeared in the original film. Specifically, Flounder is shown sighing while Ariel is singing one line, whose lips are later shown to be out of sync with <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> is singing in the following scene for a few seconds. The edit upset some purist fans who demanded that Disney recall the DVDs. While acknowledging that a [...] "minor oversight" [...] did occur during the editing process that resulted in the switching of two scenes during [...] "Part of Your World", Disney originally assured customers that [...] "There is no impact on the quality or overall experience of the film". However, the studio eventually allowed owners of the defective discs to contact them to receive a free replacement with the error corrected.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} debuted at {{number one on}} MTV's TRL on March 2, 2001. The video begins with Spears and her boyfriend in a hammock. Cuts of her cuddling with her love {{interest}} beside a fire are also included. We also see her and her boyfriend on the seashore doing a love scene. Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> wants her boyfriend to know. In {{the second half of}} the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend reaches for her. There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video. The music video was considered by Spears as [...] "the funnest video I've ever done." [...] An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album [...] Vineyard considered the footage as the one that [...] "makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", an opening door from [...] "My Prerogative" [...] and one love interest from [...] "Toxic" [...] all making cameos".|$|E
2500|$|From the New York {{listening}} party Rolling Stone said [...] "'Million Dollar Bill' is a clattering, uptempo hip-hop-inspired number. It may be {{the fastest}} ever for Houston, who keeps up nicely. It received a standing ovation setting the tone {{for much of the}} album." [...] MTVs Shaheem Reid comments revolved around the first track 'Million Dollar Bill', saying that [...] "Houston sings of looking for love and finding a man with potential. [...] "If he makes you feel like a million-dollar bill, say, 'Oh, oh/ Oh, oh,' [...] " [...] she sings on the hook. [...] "It's {{been a long time since}} love has come my way. I've been looking and searching for a man to touch this place." [...] Right from the start, 'Million Dollar Bill' displays her billion-dollar voice over a club-friendly Swizz track that even got Alicia Keys up and dancing while taking video with her personal camera as <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> wrote boomed through the speakers. Dean Piper of the Daily Mirror considered it a [...] "summer track" [...] reminiscent of Janet Jackson's [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do people kiss, then, upon Barsoom?" [...] I asked, when <b>she</b> had {{explained}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> used, {{in answer to}} my inquiry as to its meaning.|$|R
60|$|At each {{repetition}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> {{shook her head}} in his face. She was adorable. Gavin's arms--but they met on nothing. She had run away.|$|R
5000|$|Popular singer, Rihanna, {{has been}} outspoken about {{her use of}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "cunt". <b>She</b> was photographed in 2011 wearing a {{necklace}} spelling <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> later explained why she uses it {{in an interview with}} British Vogue. The Barbados-born singer said she [...] "never knew" [...] that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> was offensive until she moved to the United States.|$|R
2500|$|In a CounterPunch {{article in}} August 2005, Cockburn {{referred}} to Hitchens as: [...] "A guy who called Sid Blumenthal {{one of his}} best friends and then tried to have him thrown into prison for perjury; a guy who waited til his friend Edward Said was on his death bed before attacking him in the Atlantic Monthly; a guy who knows perfectly well the role Israel plays in US policy but who does not scruple to flail Cindy Sheehan as a LaRouchie and anti-Semite because, maybe, she dared mention the word Israel." [...] In response Hitchens stood by his standpoint on the deposition he made to prosecutors regarding Sidney Blumenthal during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and his critical review of Edward Said's book Orientalism (1978). He stated that the review was determined by the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication and not by the state of Said's health. On Cindy Sheehan, Hitchens backtracked [...] "On consideration, I would take back the word 'LaRouchie', which I applied not to her but to <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> said she didn't utter (but did)." [...] Cockburn comments, [...] "Six hundred and twenty nine words into a seven hundred and eighty-two-word letter Hitchens addresses the very first point I raised, slipping us the news that he takes it back." ...|$|E

60|$|Lucy {{hesitated for}} an instant. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> uttered came from unmoving lips.|$|E
60|$|There was a soft, voluptuous {{promise to}} himself in <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>She</b> was chilled but arrogant.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} and hid her face. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>she</b> uttered were in a shamed, unnatural voice.|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t want {{to attract}} so much; I think it’s vulgar.” She spoke {{as if she}} liked to use <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> was evidently open to new sources of pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> used," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Tolbridge, [...] "and as I said before, {{the only}} question she asked was whether or not my husband was in trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us all go," [...] said Juanna, whose nerve {{began to}} fail her; and suiting the action to <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> led <b>the</b> way towards the rock tunnel, {{followed}} by the others.|$|R

6000|$|... "You will? Oh, {{will you}} really? How good {{you are to}} me. Then I will sleep!" [...] And almost at <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>she</b> gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now get ready. Wait till I give <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> won't want {{to mount}} the reef; a boat hates shoal water. Stand by--wait--WAIT--keep her well in hand. NOW cramp her down! Snatch her! snatch her!' ...|$|R
60|$|Feemy gave a long, {{long sigh}} as <b>she</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> wished for no message from her brother; he had robbed her of everything; {{she could not}} think of him without horror and shuddering.|$|R
