5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E

5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> 5f46d17s2. This differs from <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> expected by the Aufbau principle {{in that one}} electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Möbius-Kantor <b>configuration</b> can be {{augmented}} by adding four lines through the four pairs of points not already connected by lines, and {{by adding a}} ninth point on the four new lines. <b>The</b> resulting <b>configuration,</b> <b>the</b> Hesse <b>configuration,</b> shares with <b>the</b> Möbius-Kantor <b>configuration</b> <b>the</b> property of being realizable with complex coordinates but not with real coordinates.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of intensified simple column configurations (ISC) for multicomponent distillations is presented. <b>The</b> ISC <b>configurations</b> use less columns and less heat exchangers than <b>the</b> traditional distillation <b>configurations</b> (TDC), while {{they keep the}} similar structural simplicity as <b>the</b> TDC <b>configurations</b> that each column produces an overhead product with a condenser and a bottoms product with a reboiler. For an N-component zeotropic mixture, an easy-to-use procedure is first formulated to generate <b>the</b> ISC <b>configurations</b> from <b>the</b> simple column <b>configurations</b> (SC) with only sharp splits. Then, the procedure is generalized to produce <b>the</b> ISC <b>configurations</b> from any traditional distillation configurations (TDC) with both sharp and sloppy splits. It is demonstrated that the procedure can explicitly modify <b>the</b> TDC <b>configurations</b> step-by-step to systematically generate all <b>the</b> possible ISC <b>configurations.</b> <b>The</b> ISC <b>configurations</b> have <b>the</b> potential to reduce both energy consumption and capital costs than <b>the</b> TDC <b>configurations,</b> at <b>the</b> same time, they have the similar structural simplicity in terms of systems design, control and operation as <b>the</b> traditional distillation <b>configurations.</b> Therefore, they constitute an advantageous alternatives subspace when looking for an optimal system for a specific application in both new design and retrofit of distillation plants...|$|R

The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements.

5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E
