25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|We must {{single out}} <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as {{completely}} as possible. And {{in this manner}} give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children {{may be found in}} all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{portrait}} of Sigmund Freud in close-up, then shows a picture of Farmer's mother. The song's lyrics are subtitled. Still images of Farmer are then shown in silhouette wearing a white and transparent nightgown. With each line of the song, an image of Farmer appears. When the chorus begins, Farmer turns blue and begins to dance {{in front of a}} backdrop featuring stars and the moon. Three children are shown looking at Farmer. After another verse, which again features still images of Farmer, shots of the singer jumping are intercut with shots of her singing along with the track with her arms clutched to her breast. Afterwards Farmer and the three children are shown holding placards with the words [...] "Maman a tort". Following another verse the singer's decapitated head is pictured on a plate on a table in front of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> holding knives and forks. The singer is again shown in blue and cries before being slapped in the face. A low-angle shot of Farmer shows her readjusting the strap of her nightgown and is intercut with images of her in silhouette. The video ends with a portrait of Freud.|$|E

500|$|Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post {{noted that}} like the novel, {{the film is}} {{difficult}} to embrace. He said that the film does work on a [...] "suspense level", due to Romanek's creating a [...] "quiet, leisurely pace {{that would not be}} out of place in a yoga class". He stated that he [...] "no doubt was aiming for an eerie, Children of the Damned vibe, except that it's <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> damned". The writer concluded that Never Let Me Gos final result is a [...] "staid, lifeless tale that never talks about what it's about, or at least not enough to provoke deep thoughts on the subject." [...] Film critic Rex Roberts of Film Journal International thought that the film was moderately surprising given Romanek and Garland's previous work, saying that they [...] "show real affinity for the subtle shades of resignation and quiet desperation that characterize Isighuro's [...] prose and, as would be expected, accentuate the unsettling eeriness that pervades Never Let Me Go". Roberts felt that Mulligan and Knightley were not convincing in portraying their ages until the last third of the movie.|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E

2500|$|According to the novels, {{admission}} to Hogwarts is selective, in {{that children who}} show magical ability will automatically gain a place, and squibs cannot attend the school as students (though they can work there in other roles, as Argus Filch does).

[...] Every year, a teacher checks this book and sends a letter to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> turning eleven. Acceptance or refusal of a place at Hogwarts must be posted by 31 July. The letter also contains a list of supplies like spell books, uniform, and other things that the student will need. The prospective student is expected to buy all the necessary materials, normally from shops in Diagon Alley, a concealed street near Charing Cross Road in London that can be found behind the wizarding pub, The Leaky Cauldron.

2500|$|Reading [...] "and {{they brought}} the Tabernacle," [...] a Midrash taught that {{on the day that}} the Tabernacle was set up, the Israelites rejoiced greatly because God then dwelt in their midst.
