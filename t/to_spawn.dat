5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Jumping Flash! 2 {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised {{the game for}} its updated interface, advanced graphics and gameplay. However, also like its predecessor, it was criticised for its short length, lack of challenging gameplay and close similarities to the first game. Despite this, Jumping Flash! 2 gained enough popularity <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> a final sequel, Robbit Mon Dieu.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required <b>to</b> <b>spawn)</b> in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009.

5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced <b>to</b> <b>spawn.</b> Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E

40|$|Cod is a {{determinate}} spawner, with a {{high potential}} fecundity. That is, a large definite number of oocytes start maturing prior <b>to</b> <b>spawning.</b> Environmental factors, such as water temperature and food availability have strong effects on nutritional status and fish size. Accumulation of energy prior <b>to</b> <b>spawning</b> is important, as food intake during spawning is minimum. Fecundity is a changeable process that can be adjusted to {{the condition of the}} fish. Under favorable circumstances potential fecundity may be equivalent to the number of eggs spawned during the spawning season. When the environmental conditions are unfavorable some or all, developing oocytes included in the potential fecundity estimate may be lost through resorption from the ovary, a process known as atresia. Atresia seems mainly to be initiated under low nutritional status prior <b>to</b> <b>spawning.</b> The relationship between atresia and oocyte diameter is negatively related. As the oocyte diameter increases during the spawning season, occurrence of atresia decreases...|$|R
40|$|Contribution No. 17, SEAFDEC. Spent Penaeus monodon {{females were}} tagged around one eyestalk with {{numbered}} brass tags, stocked {{in a concrete}} tank with males, and periodically examined for ovarian rematuration over a six-month period (February to August, 1977). The females were either artificially-induced (ablated spawners from concrete tanks and marine pens) or wild spawners. Most of the wild spawners were ablated after spawning; some remained unablated to serve as controls. Out {{of a total of}} 349 experimental females, 35 or 10 1 % had a second spawning and 5 or 1 4 % a third spawning; none of the 74 controls spawned subsequently.

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals <b>to</b> <b>spawn.</b>|$|E

The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river <b>to</b> <b>spawn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity River {{was once}} {{known for its}} {{prolific}} anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) runs. The actual number of fish returning to the river each year <b>to</b> <b>spawn,</b> prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall chinook salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{proliferation}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> and die.|$|E

5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life <b>to</b> <b>spawn</b> on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Recent {{declines in}} the number of sockeye salmon Onchorynchus nerka {{returning}} to Lake Clark, Alaska have caused economic hardship in the region and raised resource concerns among local subsistence users and Federal managers. A lack of information regarding the distribution of spawning habitats in the glacially turbid Lake Clark watershed instigated this research. Radio telemetry was used to 1) determine the in-lake movement patterns of adult sockeye salmon and 2) identify sockeye salmon spawning locations. Sockeye salmon were radio tagged at they entered Lake Clark and tracked <b>to</b> <b>spawning</b> locations. After entering Lake Clark, sockeye salmon usually migrated to a region of the lake that was within 15 km of their spawning location. Tagged fish migrated faster and more directly <b>to</b> <b>spawning</b> locations in tributary rivers and lakes than to Lake Clark beaches. Thirty three spawning locations were identified in the Lake Clark watershed including 18 new <b>spawning</b> locations compared <b>to</b> previous scientific research and ten compared to traditional local knowledge. Most radio tagged sockeye salmon (65 %) returned <b>to</b> <b>spawning</b> locations in glacially turbid waters and most spawning locations (75 %) were adjacent to privately owned lands.

5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream <b>to</b> <b>spawn,</b> and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E
