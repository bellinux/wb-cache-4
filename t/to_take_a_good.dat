5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
25|$|In May 1883, President Chester A. Arthur—under {{stress from}} {{the first years of}} his {{unexpected}} presidency—was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rest by his advisors. One of those advisors, Senator George Vest of Missouri, suggested a trip to the new national park—Yellowstone. By early summer, the unusual trip was being arranged. President Arthur would visit the park for two weeks in August, unaccompanied by any journalists. Through his notoriety with the Northern Pacific Railroad and early trips to Yellowstone, F. Jay Haynes was selected as the official photographer for the trip.|$|E
25|$|The donor is {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> breath and pass his/her demand valve (or mouthpiece {{in the case}} of a twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who {{is expected}} to take two good breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should expect this and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the demand valve throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the demand valve is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the demand valve. This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{the concept}} of [...] "employeeship" [...] recognizes that what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leader is not too {{dissimilar}} <b>to</b> what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results. This approach has been particularly successful in Sweden where the power distance between manager and team is small.|$|R

25|$|Football League runners-up {{and twice}} champions Preston North End sent an under-strength eleven for a {{friendly}} meeting with Small Heath. The team was further weakened when their trainer {{had to play}} in place of Bob Roberts, who failed to turn up, {{but they were still}} too good for their hosts. Aston Villa did much of the attacking in the semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup but Charsley and his defenders were up to their task, and Small Heath progressed to the final by two goals to nil. In the final, at Aston Lower Grounds, Hallam scored with a header after only five minutes, and failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance when Wolverhampton Wanderers' goalkeeper lost his grip on the ball, but at the interval the score was 1–1. In the second half, with both sun and wind in their favour, Heath struck the woodwork several times, but the only goal came when an error from their backs allowed Harry Wood a free run.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

After being chosen by guest judge and children's-book author Lou Berger, the story was professionally illustrated. The final contest was about [...] "someone who inspired you".

A case manager for patients with HIV, Islas-Hooker was consistently inspired by one special individual who never gave up the fight to live.|$|E
2500|$|The format {{was that}} of a four-team league, in which each would play the two teams from the other {{division}} on a home-and-away basis. Small Heath's campaign began at Liverpool, whose forwards were restricted to one goal in the first half through the efforts of Lester and Oliver, but in the second, the Liverpool Mercurys report that [...] "the whole of the play was confined to the visitors' quarters" [...] was little of an exaggeration as the home side won 4–0. In the home match, Hallam and Walton came in for Mobley and Farnall. Small Heath came close to conceding when Tom Bradshaw spotted Meates off his line, but Jack Oliver got back in time to clear. They had more of the play, with Wheldon was particularly dangerous in attack, and threw caution to the winds as full-time approached, but the game finished goalless. A 3–0 defeat at Manchester City confirmed Small Heath's relegation to the Second Division for the 1896–97 season. Meates opened the scoring for City when he sliced the ball into his own net in attempting a clearance, and after Hallam failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance {{in the first half and}} struck the crossbar in the second as the visitors tried hard to equalise, City scored twice more towards the end of the match. For the last test match, at home to Manchester City, Small Heath selected Thomas Dunlop and Walter Abbott instead of Oliver and Hands. Small Heath had all of the play, [...] "shots without number" [...] were attempted but only one was scored by half-time. They scored a further seven in the second half, with hat-tricks for Jones and Wheldon and a goal on debut for Abbott.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{source of}} {{evidence}} for the steppe hypothesis {{is the presence of}} what appears to be many shared loanwords between Uralic languages and proto-Indo-European, suggesting that these languages were spoken in adjacent areas. This would have had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal further north than the Anatolian or Near Eastern scenarios would allow. According to Kortlandt, Indo-Uralic is the pre-PIE, postulating that Indo-European and Uralic share a common ancestor. According to Kortlandt, [...] "Indo-European is a branch of Indo-Uralic which was radically transformed under the influence of a North Caucasian substratum when its speakers moved from the area north of the Caspian Sea to the area north of the Black Sea." [...] Anthony notes that the validity of such deep relationships cannot be reliably demonstrated due to the time-depth involved, and also notes that the similarities may be explained by borrowings from PIE into proto-Uralic. Yet, Anthony also notes that the North Caucasian communities [...] "were southern participants in the steppe world." ...|$|R
