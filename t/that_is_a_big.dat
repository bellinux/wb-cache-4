In , {{producer}} Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for Avatar that will [...] "lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with", saying that [...] "Jim wants to write a novel <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> epic story that fills in a lot of things". In August 2013 it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the Avatar universe.|$|E

Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the [...] "unblack" [...] - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that [...] "at {{the same time that}} we are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics, for absolutely everyone – Christians and non-believers alike – experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He will be with us and carry us through it, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of the Antestor message." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 19, 2010, Mars {{was arrested}} in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Casino for {{possession}} of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that {{what he did was}} [...] "foolish" [...] and that [...] "he has never used drugs before." [...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said [...] "I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking", he added: [...] "I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--." [...] Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying [...] "I don't know where that came from", adding: [...] "I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk.

2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling {{you get when you}} put the ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E

50|$|HIs {{first film}} {{under the new}} {{arrangement}} <b>was</b> <b>an</b> action comedy Soldiers Three (1951). Granger followed it with location work for Constable Pedley in Canada. This was put on hold so Granger could make a light comedy, The Light Touch, in a role meant for Cary Grant. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> box office disappointment. However filming resumed on Constable Pedley which became The Wild North (1953) and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit.|$|R

2500|$|The series uses green {{screen to}} augment the live action, {{inserting}} views of outdoor scenes in windows and broadcast images on TV monitors, often in post-production. The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, in a room <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. We have very long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew go to Washington, D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions you see in the scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up driving plates, and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E

Peter is what wise men call a phi-los-o-pher. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> word, but its meaning is very simple. A philosopher is one who {{believes}} that it is foolish to think about things that have happened, except to learn some lesson from them, and {{that the best thing}} to do is to make the most of the present. Peter had learned his lesson. He was sure of that.|$|E

I didn't have that parental guidance, and I kind of took advantage of it because I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> stupid idiot. I decided not to go to school a couple of times, go when I felt like it.

Still, it took time; and before we met, Hilda had had leisure to settle down quietly to her new existence. People in Rhodesia had noted her coming, as a new portent, because of one strange peculiarity. She was the only woman of means who had ever gone up of her own free will to Rhodesia. Other women had gone there to {{accompany}} their husbands, or to earn their livings; but that a lady should freely select that half-baked land as a place of residence--a lady of position, with all the world before her where to choose--that puzzled the Rhodesians. So she was a marked person. Most people solved the vexed problem, indeed, by suggesting that she had designs against the stern celibacy of a leading South African politician. [...] "Depend upon it," [...] they said, [...] "it's Rhodes she's after." [...] The moment I arrived at Salisbury, and stated my object in coming, all the world in the new town was ready to assist me. The lady was to be found (vaguely speaking) on a young farm to the north--a budding farm, whose general direction was expansively indicated to me by a wave of the arm, with South African uncertainty.|$|E
