40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} an {{apparent lack of}} analyses associated with the modal choice characteristics of transit-oriented developments (TODs) and emphasized the need for quick response models for estimating <b>transit</b> <b>share</b> in TOD areas. In this paper, a methodology for developing transit-share model for TOD’s using travel activity data is presented. A transit-share model is formulated as an innovative combination of the direct generation, urban travel factor (UTF), and logit models. This model determines transit usage in TODs based on household auto ownership as the primary input and the transit system variables as secondary inputs. Validation of the model indicates a close agreement with observed data. Since the input requirements to the TOD transit-share model are minimal, this model structure {{is expected to be}} very useful for sketch analysis of many TOD project alternatives...|$|E

Its magnitudes and temporal trends {{play an important role in}} both policy debates at areawide levels (nationwide, states, regions, etc.) and in performance monitoring at sub-area levels (activity centers and corridors). The census journey-to-work data have typically been used for areawide measurement of <b>transit’s</b> usual mode <b>share,</b> i. e., the share of workers who usually use transit for commuting. There has been much controversy and confusion in the literature about using census journey-to-work data for measuring <b>transit</b> mode <b>share.</b> Among the controversies is whether <b>transit</b> mode <b>share</b> should be measured only for locations where transit is available. The confusion relates to whether <b>transit’s</b> usual mode <b>share</b> would understate <b>transit’s</b> actual mode <b>share,</b> i. e., the share of work trips that are made by transit as revealed by respondents to daily travel surveys. Objectives The research goal was to examine the controversy and confusion in the literature and to develop alternative measures of <b>transit</b> mode <b>share.</b> To accomplish this goal, the research was designed to accomplish the following five objectives: 1) to develop a framework for considering the measurement of transit mode share; 2) to analyze the confusion on the relationship between transit’s usual and actual mode shares; 3) to assess the sensitivity of <b>transit</b> mode <b>share</b> to a variety of controversies raised about using the census journey-to-work data to measuring transit mode share; 4) to examine areawide measurement of transit mode share; and 5) to examine sub-area measurement of <b>transit</b> mode <b>share.</b> Findings and Conclusions These objectives have been successfully achieved.

30|$|About {{the impact}} of the density, an {{important}} observation is highlighted by Eidlin [11]. According to this contribution, the critical issue is not the density values, but its distribution within an urban area. This consideration derives from the analysis of the city of Los Angeles that is characterized by an average density of activities and residences higher than many other Americans cities, but these values are correlated with one of the lower levels of <b>transit</b> <b>share.</b> The comparison with the data of New York and San Francisco, characterized by the largest level of transit use in the US but by an average value of population density lower than Los Angeles, permits to underline that this condition derives from the low variation of population and activities density within the territory, that is what the author defines as “the worst of all worlds”.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmpirical {{studies have}} shown that demand for {{multimodal}} transport systems is highly correlated with activity schedules of individuals. Nonetheless, existing analytical equilibrium models of multimodal systems have only considered trip-based demand. We propose a new market equilibrium model that is sensitive to traveler activity schedules and system capacities. The model is based on a constrained mixed logit model of activity schedule choice, where each schedule in the choice set is generated with a multimodal extension of the Household Activity Pattern Problem. The extension explicitly accounts for both passenger choices of activity participation and multimodal choices like public transit, walking, and vehicle parking. The market equilibrium is achieved with Lagrangian relaxation to determine the optimal dual price of the capacity constraint, and a method of successive averages with column generation finds an efficient choice set of activity schedules to assign flows over the dynamic network load capacities. An example illustrates the model and algorithm, effects similar to Vickrey's morning commute model can be observed as a special case. A case study of the Oakville Go Transit station access “last mile” problem in the Greater Toronto Area is conducted with 166 survey samples reflecting 3, 680 individuals.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a model of}} travel behavior for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area using the 1990 Travel Behavior Inventory. The model incorporates mode choice {{and the number of}} trips individuals take. Using the estimation results, we report estimates for mode share price elasticities and find that they are quite low. All mode share elasticities are less than 0. 25 which means that a 4 % price change could cause no more than a 1 % change in mode share. Mode share elasticities for nonwork trips are higher than those for work trips indicating that there is greater flexibility in non-work trip mode choices than in work trip choices. Two pricing policy simulations are performed and the results verify that there is low mode choice responsiveness to price changes. The welfare costs associated with these policies are derived. It is found that a 10 % gasoline tax would cost the average traveler $ 0. 33 per day. A transit fare reduction by one-half would benefit the average traveler $ 0. 12 per day. It should be noted though that the transit fare reduction affects {{only a small part of}} the population who, apparently, receive large cost savings. Although the transit fare reduction does not reduce vehicle use by much, it does increase the <b>transit</b> <b>share</b> by 24 %, a substantial increase in ridership. The results presented here imply that large price changes are necessary to induce people to reduce their vehicle use either by switching modes or reducing the number of trips they take.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study tax {{competition}} on a parallel road network when different governments have tolling authority on different links of the network. Reflecting many current situations in Europe, each link is used by both local and transit traffic, and transit has a choice of route. Each government maximises the surplus of local users plus total tax revenues in controlling local and transit transport. Three types of tolling systems are considered: (i) toll discrimination between local traffic and transit, (ii) uniform tolls on local and transit transport, (iii) local tolls only. The results suggest that the welfare effects of introducing transit tolls are large, but that differentiation of tolls between local and transit transport as compared to uniform tolls does not yield large welfare differences. Moreover, the welfare effects of coordination between countries are relatively small in comparison with the welfare gains of tolling transit. Numerical application of the model further illustrates the effects of different <b>transit</b> <b>shares</b> and explicitly considers the role of asymmetries between countries. Higher <b>transit</b> <b>shares</b> strongly raise the Nash equilibrium transit toll and slightly decrease local tolls.

40|$|One of {{the more}} disappointing {{transportation}} trends of the 1980 s was mass <b>transit's</b> declining market <b>share</b> of metropolitan trips throughout the United States. Despite the infusion of {{tens of billions of}} dollars in public assistance for constructing new facilities and supporting bus and rail operations, <b>transit's</b> nationwide <b>share</b> of total commute trips fell from 6. 4 percent in 1980 to 5. 3 percent in 1990.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} stimulate {{thinking}} on improving public transit {{by examining the}} success factors for low cost airlines and asking the question, how might a low cost airline operate a public transit system? The paper outlines key business strategies used by low cost airlines and suggests how public transit might apply these strategies. These suggestions are intended {{to serve as a}} starting point for additional research, rather than as fully developed recommendations. The goal is to encourage researchers and professionals to consider and invent new ideas for improving public transit service. Airlines and public <b>transit</b> <b>share</b> several key traits. Both industries move people, require large capital investments, have high labor costs, and are in financial trouble. Interestingly, a new breed of airline, modeled after Southwest, has been extremely successful even in today’s turbulent travel market. The Southwest Model consists of mutually reinforcing practices in the areas of: business strategy, product definition, operations, and organization. Southwest’s most basic feature is its unrelenting focus on reducing costs. Importantly it does not do this by reducing wages or pressuring employees, since Southwest believes that taking care of its employees is a key reason for its success. This paper is the first part of a larger research study; it begins with an analysis of the need for change in the transit industry, then summarizes the strategies used by low cost airlines based on a literature review, and, finally, presents ideas for applying those strategies in the transit industry. It is acknowledged that these ideas for applying airline strategies to public transit need additional research; the objective of this paper is to stimulate this research. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{variations}} {{in levels of}} transit usage to work from block groups in the Boston metropolitan area were explored. The examination of the 2000 Census data showed that {{there were significant differences}} in the <b>transit</b> <b>share</b> of the work trip at the block group level. In order to understand this variation, which is required to plan and implement transportation policy in the region, the study area was categorized into three groups based on the level of relative job accessibility. Commuting patterns in these areas were examined and compared to each other. First, the conceptual and measurement issues surrounding accessibility are reviewed. Next, travel time impedance functions were developed using the journey to work data from Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) 2000, considering both transit and auto travel time between all origin-destination pairs in the Boston Metropolitan area thanks to the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS), the transportation network data from Massachusetts Geographic Information Systems (MassGIS), and the job location data from Initiatives for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC). (cont.) Then, job accessibility by auto and transit were calculated based on a hypothesis that job accessibility {{is an important factor in}} determining transit mode share from both residential and workplace perspectives. Finally, the spatial robustness of the general trip distribution was examined using GIS to compare mode choice behavior in block groups with different land use characteristics: block groups in the high relative job accessibility areas, block groups in the low relative job accessibility areas, and block groups in the entire study area. The comparison led to the conclusion that it is unrealistic to think that simple models such as those developed earlier in this research could be generally applied to all block groups in the metropolitan area. The geographical analyses suggested that a disaggregate approach should be applied not only to data collection (e. g., collecting individual survey data) but also to developing mode split models in order to improve their explanatory power. by Jeeseong Chung.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} Systems Approach—a combination of economic theory, spatial analysis and transportation modeling—to analyze {{the effects of}} increased intermodalism on transportation system performance. Using utility theory, a cost model is developed to explore conceptually the relationship between auto pricing, transit quality of service, and mode choice on a simple network. The model results suggest that increasing the disutility of automobile travel while providing high-quality transit can reduce total system and average user costs at a sustainable user equilibrium. ^ The conceptual approach is extended to a sub-regional, multimodal route choice model of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania network, concentrating on the region 2 ̆ 7 s most congested highway links. The model 2 ̆ 7 s trip table is generated by choosing trips ends for which transit competes effectively with private automobiles. The transportation literature suggests this occurs in areas with high-density land uses. Urban economists and spatial analysts call these locations “activity centers” and define them based on employment data. This definition is extended to include classifications of centers and, more importantly, the trip-generating characteristics of a center 2 ̆ 7 s employment. This new definition {{is applied to the}} Philadelphia metropolitan region using GIS. From the centers identified, eight are chosen for the sub-model due to their proximity to highly congested links. ^ The sub-regional route choice model quantifies the impacts of changes in auto and transit generalized costs on <b>transit</b> <b>share</b> and regional system performance. Pertinent measures of effectiveness include transit modal split, total system delay (network congestion) and a transit “competitiveness” measure defined for individual and aggregated trip ends. The model is solved using an origin-based algorithm that converges much more rapidly and achieves much higher accuracy than earlier algorithms. ^ Three auto disincentives measures are tested individually with limited improvement in system performance. Similarly, three transit incentives are evaluated; only modest gains in system performance are observed. Finally, combinations of auto disincentives and transit incentives are implemented. The combined measures markedly improve system performance and reduce user costs compared to the measures testes independently, thereby validating the conceptual findings on a sub-regional level. The research concludes by discussing model limitations and possible extensions of the work. ...|$|E
