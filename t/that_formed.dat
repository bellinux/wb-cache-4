5000|$|Each {{emulsion}} has a {{place within}} each crystal where LIs are formed preferentially. They are called [...] "sensitivity centers." [...] Emulsions <b>that</b> <b>form</b> LIs in the interior are called internal(ly) sensitive emulsions, and those <b>that</b> <b>form</b> LI on the surface are called surface sensitive emulsions. The sensitivity type largely reflects the site of very shallow electron traps <b>that</b> <b>form</b> latent images effectively.|$|R

50|$|A strand swamp or strand {{is a type}} of swamp in Florida <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> {{a linear}} {{drainage}} channel on flatlands. A forested wetland ecological habitat, strands occur on land areas with high water tables where the lack of slope prevents stream formation. Strands are more linear than the cypress dome swamps <b>that</b> <b>form</b> in more rounded depressions and are fairly similar to floodplain swamps <b>that</b> <b>form</b> further north along streams and rivers.|$|R

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the Saturnian system of Titan, mid-sized moons, and rings {{developed}} from a set-up closer to the Galilean moons of Jupiter, though the details are unclear. It has been proposed either that a second Titan-sized moon broke up, producing the rings and inner mid-sized moons, or that two large moons fused to form Titan, with the collision scattering icy debris <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> the mid-sized moons. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> Saturn in earlier times. Studies based on Enceladus's tidal-based geologic activity {{and the lack of}} evidence of extensive past resonances in Tethys, Dione, and Rhea's orbits suggest that the moons inward of Titan may be only 100 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk. They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> early in Jupiter's history.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E
