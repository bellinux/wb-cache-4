5000|$|Some paramedics and {{emergency}} medical technicians, known as Wilderness Emergency Medical Technicians, utilize expanded scope of practice protocols that are operationalized when in wilderness (remote, austere, or resource-deficient) environments. Wilderness EMS Systems (WEMS) {{have been developed}} to deliver a standard and professional medical response to wilderness areas. Examples include the national-level agencies such as the National Ski Patrol in the United States as well as local responding agencies. Like traditional EMS providers, all WEMS providers must still operate under on-line or off-line medical oversight. To assist physicians in the skills necessary to provide this oversight, the Wilderness Medical Society and the National Association of EMS Physicians jointly supported the development in 2011 of a unique [...] "Wilderness EMS Medical Director" [...] certification course, which was cited by the Journal of EMS as one of the Top 10 EMS Innovations of 2011. Common procedures utilized by WEMS providers that exceed traditional EMS scope of care include joint reduction, catheterization, antibiotic administration, selective spinal immobilization, and different <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> involving CPR cessation and wilderness skills. A multitude of organizations provide WEMS training, including private schools, non-profit organizations such as the Appalachian Center for Wilderness Medicine [...] and the Wilderness EMS Institute, [...] military branches, community colleges and universities, EMS-college-hospital collaborations, and others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The BC Harm Reduction Strategies and Services (HRSS) policy {{states that}} each health {{authority}} (HA) and their community partners {{will provide a}} full range of harm reduction (HR) services to their jurisdictions and these HR products should be available to all who need them regardless of where they live and choice of drug. Preliminary analysis revealed wide variations between and within HAs. Methods The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze distribution of HR products by site using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and to investigate the range, adequacy and methods of HR product distribution using qualitative interviews. The BC Centre for Disease Control pharmacy database tracks HR supplies distributed to health units and community agencies. Additionally, eleven face-to-face interviews were conducted in eight mainland BC communities using an open-ended questionnaire. Results There is evidence in BC that HR supplies are not equally available throughout the province. There are variations within jurisdictions in how HR supplies are distributed, adequacy of current HR products, collection of used needles, alternative uses of supplies and community attitudes towards HR. GIS illustrates where HR supplies are ordered but with secondary distribution, true reach and availability of supplies cannot be determined. Conclusion Currently, a consultant is employed to develop a 'best practice' document; relevant health files, standard <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> within HAs are also being developed. There is a need to enhance the profile and availability of culturally appropriate HR services for Aboriginal populations. Distribution of crackpipe mouthpieces is being investigated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Our {{goals are}} to: 1) {{disseminate}} a high-quality tobacco dependence treatment training program to PHC providers based on guidelines of best practice; 2) disseminate a tool kit of patient/provider resources to support integration of tobacco treatment into PHC settings; 3) provide outreach and booster {{education to the}} network of PHC providers. Material and Methods The TiTAN {{program is designed to}} move beyond generic smoking cessation training and provide <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> that have been tailored for use in busy primary care practice. The program involves an adaptation of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation that was successfully pilot tested (n= 52) in Greece as part of the TiTAN Crete Project (2014 - 2016). The TiTAN-Greece & Cyprus Project we will further expand the network by training 300 PHC providers (family medicine residents, PHC nurses, allied health professionals) in four geographic regions in Greece (Crete, Athens, Ioannina, Thessaloniki) and Cyprus. Results A pre-post evaluation (n= 300) will be used to examine the impact of the program on: i) provider attitudes, knowledge, intentions; and ii) rates of evidence-based tobacco treatments (5 As) delivery. We will randomly select a sub-sample of providers (n= 20) and will survey patients (n= 800) from their practice in order to validate changes in 5 As delivery. Conclusions The TiTAN project will provide leadership and coordination for the dissemination of both a professional training program and practice tools that are tailored to support busy PHC providers and increase the number of tobacco control champions working in Greece and Cyprus.

40|$|Background: Physical {{inactivity}} {{increases the}} risk of several chronic, non-communicable diseases which ultimately reduces life expectancy. Recently, major lifestyle changes in Saudi Arabia due to economic growth, globalization, and modernization resulted in physical inactivity and low level of physical fitness. Health care professionals can {{play an important role in}} developing awareness about physical fitness among people. However, little is known about the impact of current health promotion practices of Saudi healthcare providers. This cross-sectional study evaluates Saudi primary healthcare providers’ attitudes, knowledge, and awareness associated with advising patients about physical activity during routine consultations. Methods: A quantitative survey on 803 respondents who comprised of general physicians, nurses, nurse assistants, dieticians and health educators in five districts of Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia was conducted using convenience sampling method. Results: The data showed that most of the primary care staffs are quite enthusiastic in promoting physical activity among the patients and revealed that they routinely discussed and advised about the benefits of physical fitness. However, there are some factors acting as barriers for promoting physical activity, such as i) lack of time, ii) lack of educational materials for patients, iii) lack of proper <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> for health care professionals, iv) lack of patient cooperation, and v) lack of financial incentive. Conclusion: Proper strategies should be developed to motivate primary health care professionals, so that they can effectively encourage the general population to be more active physically. Hence, there is an urgent need to integrate physical activity promotion in to practice consultation in Saudi Arabia. In addition, more efforts are required from the policy makers and health professionals to gather sufficient knowledge about current physical activity recommendations...|$|E

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite a sound evidence base, the consideration of exercise as a therapeutic adjunct remains rare in mental health settings. This research project reports {{a series of studies}} examining the consideration of exercise as a strategy for promoting mental health in clinical settings. A broad, multi-level and multi-method analysis of exercise and mental health was adopted by focusing on trainers (key stakeholders responsible for treatment dissemination), providers (individuals at the forefront of treatment) and service users (individuals with clinical depression). First, the perceptions of exercise as an adjunctive therapy is qualitatively explored through interviews with Course Directors of UK training programmes in clinical psychology and mental health nurses working in acute, inpatient settings. A range of conceptual barriers are revealed such as the perceived `simplicity' of exercise interventions and the incompatibility of exercise with traditional models of understanding and treating clinical conditions. Second, {{the nature and extent of}} exercise promotion are identified within one NHS Mental Health Trust. A lack of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> are the most significant barriers. The Theory of Planned Behaviour variables of attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention predict stage of change of physical activity promotion in a health care setting. However, the past promotion of physical activity overrides much of these effects. Third, the role of exercise in the lives of individuals with depression is explored in a case study analysis of four participants of an exercise referral scheme. The context of each person's life is instrumental in understanding adherence and the experiences associated with participation in exercise and/or physical activity. These studies offer insight to some of the conceptual and structural barriers inhibiting the promotion of exercise as well as factors that may contribute to the success of such promotion within mental health settings. Recommendations are offered to enhance the development of comprehensive physical activity provision for people with mental health problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{reproductive}} life planning practices among Title X family planning health care providers and clinical staff. Reproductive life planning is a program priority for Title X clinics, those that receive federal money for providing family planning services to low-income women and men. The goal of reproductive life planning is to decrease unwanted and unintended pregnancies and improve preconception health care however; this practice has not been described. First, a conceptual analysis was conducted to create a definition of reproductive life planning that was consistent with the literature. Reproductive life planning is a process that is centered on reproductive and other life goals and is personalized, collaborative, fluid, and focused on health-promotion. Second, a mixed methods design was used to examine reproductive life planning practices and qualitative interviews were conducted to explore barriers and facilitators to implementing reproductive life planning practices. Data were obtained from health care providers and clinical staff employed at Title X clinics in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Dakota. A total of 148 clinicians completed a web-based survey which was analyzed to describe which types of patients, the topics covered, and the frequency with which reproductive life planning was discussed during an office visit. Surveys were then examined to identify 20 providers to conduct qualitative interviews with to further explore reproductive life planning practices. The qualitative interviews were also performed to explore the barriers and facilitators clinicians face to practicing reproductive life planning. The results of the web-based questionnaire were examined mainly with medians and frequencies to examine reproductive life planning practices. Qualitative interviews were coded using a content analysis approach to two aims; one to examine how reproductive life planning was using during clinic visits and two, to identify the barriers and facilitators clinicians face when discussing reproductive life planning with patients. Findings from the survey and the interviews suggest that most clinicians are discussing pregnancy intentions with their patients. However, from the interviews, three types of scope of reproductive life planning emerged; those clinicians who screened their patients’ pregnancy intentions, those who planted the seed in the patient’s mind, and those who explored the context of a patient’s life and their goals to contextualize how pregnancy and childbearing would fit into their lives in order to clarify pregnancy intention and move toward the corresponding health behaviors. It is argued that the third group of providers is using reproductive life planning as intended by experts. Finally, barriers to RLP discussions were examined as well as approached providers used to overcome the barriers. In conclusion, many clinicians are practicing reproductive life planning as intended, however many are not. Improved <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b> are needed to ensure clinicians are providing their patients with the best reproductive life planning discussions. Additionally, systemic structures, like access to quality family planning services, need to be improved to aid clinicians in helping their patient plan their families...|$|E
