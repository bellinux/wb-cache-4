When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> go back to the '82 version.|$|E
25|$|Jonathon Porritt's {{call for}} the Green Party to select a single leader is flawed. Rather than {{suggesting}} the Green Party becomes a little more like the conventional top down political parties, Jonathon could show a little more personal leadership. Last year he took 42 flight clocking up air miles to go to meetings to <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> cut CO2. I am calling on Jonathon to use video conferencing a little more and to fly a little less.|$|E
500|$|The {{only other}} times he rode it were in 1980, when he {{finished}} fourth, and in 1982, as the defending champion. When he was criticised, he said: [...] "I don't go into offices and <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> work harder, yet people ask {{me to be the}} strongest on the cobbles." [...] Hinault fell seven times in that race, including 13km from the finish when a small black dog called Gruson ran out in a bend and ran under his wheel. Hinault had been clear with Roger De Vlaeminck, Hennie Kuiper and Marc Demeyer. The incident made Hinault angry and he raced back to the others and won in Roubaix.|$|E

To <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> look, not at prodigies, comets, earthquakes, and the seeming {{exceptions}} of God's rule: but at the common, regular, simple, peaceful work of God, which is going on around us all day long in every blade of grass, and flower, and singing bird, and sunbeam, and shower. To consider the lilies of the field how they grow: which toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.--And the birds of the air: They sow not, neither reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. How much more will He feed you, who can sow, and reap, and gather into barns?--O ye of little faith, who fancy always that besides sowing and reaping honestly, you must covet, and cheat, and lie, and break God's laws instead of obeying them; or else, forsooth, you cannot earn your living? To see that the signs of God's Kingdom are not astonishing convulsions, terrible catastrophes and disorders: but order, and peace, and usefulness, in creatures which are happy, because they live according to the law which God has given them, and do their duty--that duty, of which the great poet of the English Church has sung-- ...|$|E
