6000|$|In the evening, {{the free}} trappers drew off, and {{returned}} to the camp of Fontenelle, highly delighted with their visit and with their new acquaintances, and promising to return the following day. They kept their word: day after day their visits were repeated; they became [...] "hail fellow well met" [...] with Captain Bonneville's men; treat after treat succeeded, until both parties got most potently convinced, or rather confounded, by liquor. Now came on confusion and uproar. The free trappers were no longer suffered to have all the swagger to themselves. The camp bullies and prime trappers of the party began <b>to</b> <b>ruffle</b> <b>up,</b> and to brag, in turn, of their perils and achievements. Each now tried to out-boast and out-talk the other; a quarrel ensued as a matter of course, and a general fight, according to frontier usage. The two factions drew out their forces for a pitched battle. They fell to work and belabored each other with might and main; kicks and cuffs and dry blows were as well bestowed as they were well merited, until, having fought to their hearts' content, and been drubbed into a familiar acquaintance with each other's prowess and good qualities, they ended the fight by becoming firmer friends than they could have been rendered by a year's peaceable companionship.|$|E

Willits has also stated it's a challenge to play Steven because he is so different from him, so much so he did not relate to him, he also branded Steven as [...] "not very outgoing". After two years of playing the role, Willits said that Steven [...] "started off as a bit of a bookworm but as he has grown up he has found distractions more engaging than academia!" [...] Willits added that Steven is [...] "not the trendiest guy in the world, but thankfully as time passes he gets a bit more wayward." [...] In another interview he states: [...] "I love to get out of his character when shooting is finished, and <b>to</b> <b>ruffle</b> <b>up</b> my hair which is all brushed like Steven's." [...] While interviewed by Clive Hopwood for the book Home and Away Special, Willits said that Steven's development was slow because he remained [...] "a bit of a dork". He added that Steven was destined for [...] "exciting things".|$|E

'No, no,' resumed Mr Pecksniff, chafing {{the captive}} hand reproachfully, 'of virtue--have {{enabled me to}} set such guards upon myself, that it is really {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>ruffle</b> me.
