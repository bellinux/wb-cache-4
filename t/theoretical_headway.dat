40|$|Headway {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the basic characteristics of traffic flow. The objects {{of this paper is to}} analyze the headway characteristics of the no-passing rural two-lane roads, and to obtain the reasonable <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway</b> distribution models. The lognormal distribution was used for followers' headway distributions and the negative exponential distribution for leaders'. Their parameters and proportion of the foilowers in the total traffic were estimated and analyzed the relationships between these estimated values and traffic volume. We obtained the results that parameters of the followers' headway distribution (lognormal distribution) was almost unchanged for traffic volume, and that the relationships between parameter of leaders distribution (exponential distribution) and traffic volume was essentially straight line, and that the proportion of followers in the total traffic. increased according to some curve line as traffic volume increased...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{operational}} observations, carried out on a metro line, equipped with ATP, the achievement {{is to develop a}} theoretical formulation of the reliability concept through definition of suitable indices, focussing its aleatory components. It is proved, more over, through data coming from a case study, how automation in line operation reduce variability of such aleatory components, increasing reliability. Headway reliability {{is one of the most}} important factors for evaluation of the quality of an underground railway operation. Control and regulation actions have the scope to restore a regular headway of train transit when they shift from the theoretical sequence due to a perturbation. For this reason reliability has been chosen as parameter to evaluate the effects of automation introduction in some operational aspects. It has been defined a reliability index which is the difference between real headway and <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway,</b> measured in a given section of the line. Furthermore a reliability coefficient represent a percentage of reliability index average. Actual headway is a aleatory quantity depending on other aleatory quantities like running times, stop times and times for the headline operations. The concept of the adopted theoretical model is that headway between two train running a certain section is a sum of terms depending upon running time of the section itself, transit time through stations and headline operation time...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTime headway is of {{fundamental}} importance in traffic engineering. For {{any of the}} traffic simulations to address traffic problems to be effective, accurate vehicle generation is essential. Previous research into this subject has focused on stochastic modeling for uninterrupted facilities. Yet little researches for an interrupted facility have been performed. This paper proposed <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway</b> models for a suburban arterial in Korea. Using the laser sensor-based traffic detector, {{a large amount of}} accurate headway data was obtained. To analyze by traffic flow states, the headway data were divided into five flow states. Subsequent runs test rejected the randomness for the 5 - 9 v/m flow. Hence, theoretical modeling for the remaining flow (10 - 14 v/m, 15 - 19 v/m, 20 - 24 v/m, and 25 - 29 v/m) is performed. The goodness of fit tests by Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic revealed that the Johnson SB model for 10 - 14 v/m flow, the Johnson SU model for the other three flows fitted best. The Log-Logistic model was second-best for 20 - 24 and 25 - 29 v/m flow. The Log-normal model was also accepted for 25 - 29 v/m flow. Some analyses not only on the statistics of the headway, but the fitted model exhibited somewhat different characteristics compared to those of the headway from uninterrupted facilities. This paper can provide better understanding of the headway from interrupted facilities and starting point for developing a well-descriptive simulation model for signalized arterials...|$|E
25|$|Capacity is {{inversely}} proportional to headway. Therefore, moving from two-second headways to one-second headways would double PRT capacity. Half-second headways would quadruple capacity. <b>Theoretical</b> minimum PRT <b>headways</b> {{would be based on}} the mechanical time to engage brakes, and these are much less than a half second. Although no regulatory agency has as yet (June 2006) approved headways shorter than two seconds, researchers suggest that high capacity PRT (HCPRT) designs could operate safely at half-second headways. Using the above figures, capacities above 10,000 passengers per hour seem in reach.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{subject of}} this thesis {{concerns}} algorithmic aspects of energy-related trends in computation. Within recent years, the computationally heaviest jobs are executed over massive corpora residing at data centers, whose energy profiles {{differ from those of}} standard desktops, and whose power consumption translates into an operational budget on the order of millions of dollars. Designing schedules to optimize notions of power consumption is sometimes at odds with standard techniques prevalent in the classical scheduling theory, which has traditionally focused on objectives capturing the interests of the scheduler (e. g., makespan) or of individual jobs (e. g., flow time). Thus, we study a fairly simple model of energy usage: the active time scheduling model. Formally, we are interested in scheduling a set of n jobs, each with release time, deadline and processing requirement, on a system comprised of a single batch machine, with batch parameter B. (The machine can be working on up to B jobs at the same time.) The cost of a schedule is simply {{the amount of time that}} the system, i. e., the machine, is working. This is akin to the magnitude of the schedule's projection onto the time axis. The underlying assumption is that the cost for the machine to be active is roughly the same, regardless of whether it is working on only one job or operating at full capacity. We give a fast algorithm for the basic case in which jobs are unit length and time is slotted. When time is not slotted, the problem still admits a polynomial-time solution, albeit of higher time complexity, via dynamic programming techniques. On the other hand, when time is slotted, but jobs may have multiple feasible intervals, the problem is NP-hard for B > 2, and otherwise can be solved via b-matching techniques. When jobs are arbitrary in length and can be preempted, but have a single feasible interval, we also show that a large class of algorithms is 5 -approximate. We also empirically compare algorithms within this class with the incumbent greedy algorithm due to Wolsey; the latter algorithm is widely implemented in practice. This comparison is cast within a framework general enough to capture other canonical covering problems, most notably Capacitated Set Cover. In particular, we design a heuristic LPO that essentially complements Wolsey's algorithm and propose optimizations to both approaches. At a high level, our findings solidly establish LPO as a competitive, if not superior, alternative to Wolsey's algorithm, with respect to both solution quality and number of subroutine calls made. Finally, this thesis makes <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway</b> on the well-studied busy time problem. The key assumption that sets this apart from the aforementioned active time problem is that under the busy time model, the system has access to an unlimited number of identical batch machines. For non-preemptive jobs of arbitrary length, we give a 3 -approximation that leverages important insights for the special case where the instance consists of interval jobs. When preemption is permitted, we give an exact algorithm for unbounded B; this result yields a simple 2 -approximation for bounded B...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of vehicle time headways are fundamental in many traffic engineering applications, such as capacity {{and level of}} service studies on highways, unsignalized intersections, and roundabouts. The operation of modern vehicle-actuated traffic signals {{is based on the}} measurement of time headways in the arriving traffic flow. In addition, the vehicle generation in traffic flow simulation is usually based on some theoretical vehicle time headway model. The statistical analysis of vehicle time headways has been inadequate in three important aspects: 1) There has been no standard procedure to collect headway data and to describe their statistical properties. 2) The goodness-of-fit tests have been either powerless or infeasible. 3) Test results from multi-sample data have not been combined properly. A four-stage identification process is suggested to describe the headway data and to compare it with theoretical distributions. The process includes the estimation of the probability density function, the hazard function, the coefficient of variation, and the squared skewness and the kurtosis. The four-stage identification process effectively describes those {{properties of}} the distribution that are most helpful in selecting a <b>theoretical</b> <b>headway</b> model. One of the major problems in the headway studies has been the method for goodness-of-fit tests. The two most commonly used tests are the chi-square test and the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The chi-square test is not very powerful. The nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should be applied only, when the parameters of the distribution are known. If the parameters are estimated from the data, as in typical headway studies, the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives too conservative results. These problems are addressed by parametric goodness-of-fit tests based on Monte Carlo methods. Another great problem has been the lack of theoretical foundation in dealing with multi-sample data. The headway data usually consist of several samples, and the null hypothesis is tested against each of them. Two methods are presented to strengthen the evidence of multi-sample tests: 1) The combined probability method gives a single significance probability based on several independent tests. 2) The moving probability method is used to describe the variation of combined probabilities against traffic volume. These methods were applied to time headway data from Finnish two-lane two-way roads. The independence of consecutive headways was tested using autocorrelation analysis, runs tests and goodness-of-fit tests for the geometric bunch size distribution. The results indicate that the renewal hypothesis should not be accepted in all traffic situations. This conclusion is partly supported by a further analysis of previous studies. Five theoretical distributions were tested for goodness of fit: the negative exponential distribution, the shifted exponential distribution, the gamma distribution, the lognormal distribution and the semi-Poisson distribution. None of these passed the tests. In the parameter estimation the maximum likelihood method was preferred. For distributions having a location (threshold) parameter, a modified maximum likelihood method was shown to give good estimates. The proposed procedures give a scientific foundation to identify and estimate statistical models for vehicle time headways, and to test the goodness of fit. It is shown that the statistical methods in the analysis of vehicle headways should be thoroughly revised following the guidelines presented here. reviewe...|$|E
