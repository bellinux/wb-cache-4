40|$|Six {{alternatives}} for the interim storage of remote-handled mixed <b>wastes</b> from <b>the</b> 324 Building on the Hanford Site {{have been identified}} and evaluated. The alternatives focus on the interim storage facility and include use of existing facilities in the 200 Area, {{the construction of new}} facilities, and the vitrification of <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> within <b>the</b> 324 Building to remove the majority of <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> from under RCRA regulations. The six alternatives are summarized in Table S. 1, which identifies the primary facilities to be utilized, the anticipated schedule for removal of <b>the</b> <b>wastes,</b> <b>the</b> costs of the transfer from 324 Building to the interim storage facility (including any capital costs), and an initial risk comparison of the alternatives. A recently negotiated Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) change requires the last of <b>the</b> mixed <b>wastes</b> to be removed by May 1999. The ability to use an existing facility reduces the costs since it eliminates the need for new capital construction. The basic regulatory approvals for the storage of mixed wastes are in place for the PUREX facility, but the Form HI permit will need some minor modifications since <b>the</b> 324 Building <b>wastes</b> have some additional characteristic <b>waste</b> codes and <b>the</b> current permit limits storage of wastes to those from the facility itself. Regulatory reviews have indicated that it will be best to use the tunnels to store <b>the</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>The</b> PUREX alternatives will only provide storage for about 65 % of <b>the</b> <b>wastes.</b> This results from the current schedule of the B-Cell Clean Out Project, which projects that dispersible debris will continue to be collected in small quantities until the year 2000. The remaining fraction of <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> will then be stored in another facility. Central Waste Complex (CWC) is currently proposed for that residual waste storage; however, other options may also be available...|$|R

The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
