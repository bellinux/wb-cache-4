5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in <b>the</b> <b>elbows,</b> tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on <b>the</b> <b>elbows,</b> knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E

5|$|The main armour {{used was}} chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to <b>the</b> <b>elbows.</b> Some hauberks {{may have been}} made of scales {{attached}} to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band of metal extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood, with reinforcement of metal. Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most {{would not have had}} armour.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} eccentric exercise on position sense and reaction angle of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and knee flexors. Twelve males underwent two eccentric exercise sessions involving a randomized crossover design.

Muscle damage indices, position sense, and joint reaction angle to release of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and knee flexors were measured before, immediately after, and up to 7 days after exercise. Exercise induced greater muscle damage in <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors than knee flexors. Exercise disturbed position sense of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and knee joint. For both limbs, the participants adopted a more extended position than the reference angle. <b>The</b> <b>elbow</b> and knee joint reaction angles to release increased after exercise for both <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and knee flexors. The disturbances in position sense and reaction angle after exercise were greater in <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors than knee flexors. <b>The</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors remained more accurate and faster than the knee flexors at all time points. These results may be explained by the higher density of muscle spindles and the lower innervation ratio of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors compared with the knee flexors, as well as the fact that the arms are more accustomed than the legs to perform fast and accurate movements...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{anatomical}} {{study was}} {{to find out if}} total denervation of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> joint is technically feasible. The endbranches of the brachial plexus of eight fresh-frozen upper arm cadavers were dissected with optical loupe magnification. All major nerves of the upper limb (except the axillary and the medial brachial cutaneous nerve) give some terminal articular endbranches to <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b> <b>The</b> articular endbranches arise from muscular endbranches, cutaneous endbranches, or arise straight from the main nerves of the brachial plexus. A topographic diagram was made of the different nerves innervating <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> joint. <b>The</b> ulno-posterior part of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> is innervated by the ulnar nerve and some branches of medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve. The radial-posterior part of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> is innervated exclusively by the radial nerve. The ulno-anterior part of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> is innervated by the median nerve and the musculocutaneous nerve. The radio-anterior part of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> is innervated by the radial nerve and the musculocutaneous nerve. These elbow innervation findings are relevant to both anatomical and clinical field as they provide evidence that the total denervation of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> joint is impossible. Nevertheless, partial denervation, like denervation of the lateral epicondyle or the ulnar part of elbow, is technically possible.
