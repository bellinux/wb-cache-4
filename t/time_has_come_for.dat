25|$|Hitchens {{argues that}} the human race no longer needs {{religion}} to the extent {{it has in the}} past. He says the <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures; that de-emphasizing religion will {{improve the quality of life}} of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization. It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence the <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> me to move on.|$|E

25|$|International {{isolation}} was keenly {{felt by the}} South African team at the time, including Pollock, and {{the players}} took measures to try to reverse the looming sporting boycott. In 1971, Pollock {{took part in a}} protest organised by Barry Richards and Mike Procter against the South African government's apartheid policy as it referred to cricket. During a match to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Republic of South Africa, the players from both teams walked off after one ball, issuing a joint statement: We cricketers feel that the <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> an expression of our views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association's application to invite non-whites to tour Australia, if they are good enough, and further subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.|$|E
500|$|On August 18, 2011, {{several months}} {{after the start of}} the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written {{statement}} that said: [...] "The <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> President Assad to step aside." [...] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.|$|E
500|$|Marsha Brooks, a vice {{president}} of global marketing for Coty Beauty, a division of Coty, Inc. responsible for Beyoncé's fragrance business, {{said in an interview that}} Rise was meant to leave a [...] "strong sense of 'overcoming adversity and rising above it all.'" [...] She added, [...] "The fragrance concept is a about female empowerment and finding the inner strength that makes women so beautiful... We're getting a little bit more intimate and personal with this next initiative we are doing. The <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> something more natural and emotional." [...] According to her, testings for Rise were done in multiple countries with positive feedback.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{campaign}} as low-key as possible, General Abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from Saigon. At 21:00 on 30 April, however, President Nixon appeared on all three U.S. television networks to announce that [...] "It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight" [...] and that [...] "the <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> action." [...] He announced his decision to launch American forces into Cambodia with the special objective of capturing COSVN,"the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in South Vietnam." [...] COSVN as a single headquarters for control of PAVN operations in South Vietnam probably did not exist, or, at least, was never found.|$|E
500|$|After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira {{return to}} the elven capital Ellesméra to train. There, Saphira {{revealed}} from a memory that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, is Eragon's father; which Brom asked her to show him when the time was right. Oromis and Glaedr too justify Saphira's revelation. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, or heart of hearts. An Eldunarí allows the holder to communicate with or draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased, or a great distance away. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, and forcing the deceased dragons to channel their energy to him through their Eldunari. Saphira is delighted to learn {{of the existence of}} the dragons, although imprisoned by Galbatorix's dark magics. After training, Eragon visits Rhunön, the elven blacksmith who forges swords for Riders. But Rhunön wouldn't create a weapon for him because long ago she swore an oath never to create a weapon again after the Fall of the Riders. Also her stocks of the metal, required to forge rider's swords was completely exhausted. But by deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions Eragon is able to acquire the metal he requires, from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. After Eragon's repeated requests, Rhunön creates a weapon by controlling Eragon's body. Eragon gives a name to the sword,"Brisingr." [...] As Eragon's body itself forged the sword, a special bond between the sword and Eragon had been created, thus making the sword burst into flames whenever Eragon utters Brisingr, even when he does not intend to use magic. Oromis suspects that [...] "Brisingr" [...] is part of the sword's true name. Before Eragon and Saphira depart for the Varden, Oromis says that the <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> him and Glaedr to openly oppose the Empire in combat alongside the Queen of the Elves, Islanzadí. Thus, Glaedr gives his own Eldunari to Eragon. If anything should happen to Glaedr, Eragon would still be able to get advice from him. Then Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, the city that the Varden are laying siege to.|$|E
