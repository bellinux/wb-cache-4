5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in <b>the</b> <b>betting.</b> After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in <b>the</b> <b>betting.</b> After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25, 2011. Rosecroft owed $1.24 million in unpaid disbursements under its previous simulcast license, and the parties were negotiating {{about how much}} of this debt Penn National would pay. Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day.

5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was then}} moved {{directly}} into Group Two class; {{he was sent}} to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of Marmalade had been supported in <b>the</b> <b>betting</b> for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from <b>the</b> <b>betting</b> pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in <b>the</b> <b>betting</b> for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E

5|$|Wizard {{then went}} to Epsom Downs for the Derby Stakes, where he was again ridden by Clift, {{as he had been}} in his {{previous}} two races. He started as the odds-on favourite, priced at about 8/11. Fair Star was the second favourite, with Salivator third in <b>the</b> <b>betting.</b> Salivator took the lead and held it until the field turned into the finishing straight, where Wizard overtook him. Wizard was in front until a few yards from the finish, where he was passed by Pope, a 20/1 outsider. Pope won the race by a neck from Wizard with Salivator in third and Fair Star in fourth. In his last race of the season Wizard finished fourth in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. The race was won by Ashton, who had started as favourite.

5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in <b>the</b> <b>betting</b> at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over Â£9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E

The next day he won the Subscription Stakes easily from Porridge, after leading from the start and never being caught. He raced again the next day, his third race in as many days, in a Free Handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs where he faced five opponents. Orme started as the 4/6 favourite, Bushey Park was at 5/1. Next in <b>the</b> <b>betting</b> came El Diablo, The Lover and Therapia all priced at 100/12.
