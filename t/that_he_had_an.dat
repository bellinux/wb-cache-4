In March, Scottish club St Mirren were without the services of the injured George Elmore for their Scottish Cup quarter-final, and had hoped to use Healey in his place; he had previously played in the area with the Northern Nomads travelling team.

5|$|In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court {{he pleaded}} not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

His indefinite detention was ordered by the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and he was held in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

Around 1946 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut {{to take up a}} regular job as pianist in a nightclub.|$|E

Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40pm.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced by the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 {{straight}} scoreless innings, winning {{three consecutive}} games during that time. However, he won less frequently as the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished {{the season with a}} 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, {{and at the end of}} May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA.

5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> illegitimate baby son.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Finschhafen {{prevented}} the early occupation of Saidor. The Japanese wrested back {{the initiative and}} threatened to derail MacArthur's strategy, but ultimately failed to dislodge the Australian 9th Division or prevent the occupation of the Finschhafen area. With the battle won, the 9th Division initiated a pursuit of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's retreating Japanese Eighteenth Army on 5 December 1943. Adachi was in a difficult and precarious position, attempting to conduct a fighting withdrawal with his inland right flank vulnerable to attack from the Australian 7th Division in the Ramu Valley and his seaward left flank open to amphibious assault. <b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to destroy Adachi's army {{was not lost on}} MacArthur, who decided on 10 December that Saidor should be seized on or about 7 January, provided that Operation Backhander, the landing at Cape Gloucester, was proceeding satisfactorily. On 17 December, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of Alamo Force, received orders setting a target date for Saidor of 2 January 1944.|$|E
