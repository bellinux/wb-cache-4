5000|$|A confidante (also {{known as}} a canapé à joue, a canapé à confidants, or a canapé à confidant(e)) {{is a type of}} sofa, {{originally}} characterized by a <b>triangular</b> <b>seat</b> at each end, so that people could sit {{at either end of the}} sofa and be close to the person(s) sitting in the middle. The ends were sometimes detachable, and could be removed and used on their own as Burjair chairs. The name Confidante was coined by cabinetmaker George Hepplewhite, who described it in his Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide as being [...] "of French origin, and is in pretty general request for large and spacious suits of apartments. An elegant drawing-room, with modern furniture, is scarce complete without a Confidante, &#91;&hellip;&#93;".|$|E
5000|$|... dent {{occupies}} the Holyoke Chair, an uncomfortable and [...] Jacobean turned chair reserved for such ceremonies {{since at least}} 1770 (when it was already some two hundred years old).Called [...] "bizarre... with a complex frame and top-heavy superstructure", its [...] "square framework set on the single rear post makes it tip over easily to either side."Said the Harvard Gazette in 2007, [...] "When the chair holds its robed occupant, onlookers cannot detect the odd geometry by which its <b>triangular</b> <b>seat</b> points toward a square back rippling with knobby dowels and finials. Perhaps by striking their own precarious balance in this strange seat of authority, the successors of Edward Holyoke president 173769 come to sense what the job is all about." ...|$|E
50|$|On October 9, 1982, in the Hill House on Beacon Hill, {{members from}} the Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco Pride {{committees}} gathered in response to Levine's mailing. Three long tables were pushed {{together to make a}} <b>triangular</b> <b>seating</b> area. For two days many topics concerning coordinating LGBT prides was discussed, and while each city had different events, they discovered much of the planning and logistics was surprisingly similar. They voted to hold a second conference in San Diego the next year.|$|R
5000|$|Where Ebury Street meets Pimlico Road is a <b>triangular</b> {{area with}} <b>seating</b> and a bronze statue of Mozart (aged 8) by Philip Jackson. The area is unofficially called [...] "Mozart Square". Several houses on Ebury Street have been {{converted}} to hotels.|$|R
2500|$|... "Phase Three" [...] of {{the project}} {{involved}} work on the mall and exterior facade renovations. Cleveland City Architect Paul Volpe designed new streetlight lampposts for E. 6th Street based on 1922 designs. He also designed low-level bollard lighting for the mall, and new gold floodlights to illuminate the four sides of Public Auditorium. Landscapers preserved the 16-year-old symmetrical lines of trees on the mall, but added new <b>triangular</b> areas of <b>seating</b> {{on either side of}} the fountains. Work on the fountains, which frequently broke down, was also done.|$|R
25|$|Good {{single crystal}} {{diffraction}} experiments in diamond anvil cells require sample stage to rotate on the vertical axis, omega. Most diamond anvil cells do not feature a large opening {{that would allow}} the cell to be rotated to high angles, a 60 degrees opening is considered sufficient for most crystals but larger angles are possible. The first cell to be used for single crystal experiments was designed by {{a graduate student at the}} University of Rochester, Leo Merrill. The cell was <b>triangular</b> with beryllium <b>seats</b> that the diamonds were mounted on; the cell was pressurized with screws and guide pins holding everything in place.|$|R
50|$|The {{new model}} could be {{recognized}} {{by the addition of}} a slim louvred panel in the front lid to aid radiator exhaust air exit, power operated mirrors carrying a small enamel Ferrari badge, a redesigned radiator grille with rectangular driving lights on each side, and rectangular (in place of round) side repeaters. The interior also received some minor updates, such as a satin black three spoke steering wheel with <b>triangular</b> centre; cloth <b>seat</b> centres became available as an option to the standard full leather. Available included metallic paint, a deep front spoiler, air conditioning, wider wheels, 16-inch Speedline wheels with Pirelli P7 tyres, and a satin black roof aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|R
5000|$|However, {{this little}} section of seats (since removed as {{mentioned}} above) high above right field in foul territory {{was not the}} original [...] "Conig's Corner". When Tony first was making his comeback, he complained {{about not being able}} to see the ball well coming from the pitcher's hand because of all of the brightly colored clothing being worn by fans directly behind the pitcher in dead center field. To address Tony's problem, these seats were first blocked off and covered in black tarp to provide a better hitter's background, known as a batter's eye. This small <b>triangular</b> area of <b>seats</b> (bleacher sections 34 and 35) directly adjacent to the center field TV camera nest was the original Conig's Corner at Fenway Park. These same seats are still blocked off for day games for the same reason.|$|R
