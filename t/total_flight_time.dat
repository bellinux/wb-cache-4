In one of the earliest studies, Shepard et al., (1968) reported that the flight of 3 to 4 -day-old adult fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.

Likewise, Noblet et al., (1968) found that 2 -, 5 -, and 10 -day-old secondary screwworm flies, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.), irradiated with 25 krad as 5 -day-old pupae (ca. 5. 6 X greater than the normal dose required to produce 100 % sterility) had reduced <b>total</b> and sustained <b>flight</b> distances and spent less <b>time</b> in <b>flight.</b> In contrast, White et al., (unpublished data) reported enhanced (but not significantly different) flight by male codling moths, Laspeyresia pomonella (L.), treated with 30 krad.

The focus of this study was specifically on the flight regimes encountered by helicopter pilots. Information obtained from this research may aid training effectiveness specific to helicopter aviation. Methods There were 17 military officers, all active-duty Navy helicopter pilots, who all had different levels of flight experience based on their <b>total</b> <b>flight</b> <b>times.</b> Each pilot was asked to successfully fly and navigate a course through a simulated southern Californian desert in a fixed-based helicopter simulator modeled after the U. S. Navys MH- 60 S. The location of their scan was tracked by an eye-tracking system in order to determine scan rate and locations while they flew the course. All of the flight parameters, such as airspeed and altitude, were recorded by the simulators recording system. Results Analysis of the results obtained from the eye tracking system indicated a decreasing relationship between scan rate and pilot experience, indicating that the scan rate decreases as a pilot becomes more experienced. The analysis uses altitude variance as a measure of performance. Results indicate that higher scan rates correlate with higher degrees of variance in the altitude, indicating that a quicker scan does not necessarily result in better performance. The higher experienced pilots show a lower altitude variance overall (they were more consistent in maintaining a constant altitude above the ground), yet those pilots all exhibited slower scan rates. Discussion The integration of the eye tracking technology with a simulator representing an aircraft currently in service was a success. Although none of the null hypotheses presented were rejected, trends were evident in scan rates when compared with pilot experience. The relatively small sample size was identified as the major causal factor for the lack of significance. Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Swarms {{of flying}} robots are a {{promising}} alternative to ground-based robots for search in indoor environments with advantages such as increased speed {{and the ability}} to fly above obstacles. However, there are numerous problems that must be surmounted including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities, and low flight endurance. This paper introduces a novel strategy to coordinate a swarm of flying robots for indoor exploration that significantly increases energy efficiency. The presented algorithm is fully distributed and scalable. It relies solely on local sensing and low-bandwidth communication, and does not require absolute positioning, localisation, or explicit world-models. It assumes that flying robots can temporarily attach to the ceiling, or land on the ground for efficient surveillance over extended periods of time. To further reduce energy consumption, the swarm is incrementally deployed by launching one robot at a time. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that increasing the time between consecutive robot launches significantly lowers energy consumption by reducing <b>total</b> swarm <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> while also decreasing collision probability. As a trade-off, however, the search time increases with increased inter-launch periods. These effects are stronger in more complex environments. The proposed localisation-free strategy provides an energy efficient search behaviour adaptable to different environments or timing constraints...|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Tu-144 into passenger service was timed to the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution, as was duly noted in Soviet officials' speeches delivered at the airport before the inaugural flight - whether the aircraft was actually ready for passenger service was deemed of secondary importance. Even the outward details of the inaugural Tu-144 flight betrayed the haste of its introduction into service: several ceiling panels were ajar, service trays stuck, window shades dropped without being pulled, reading lights did not work, not all toilets worked and a broken ramp delayed departure half an hour. On arrival to Alma-Ata, the Tu-144 was towed {{back and forth for}} 25 minutes before it could be aligned with the exit ramp. Equally telling is the number of hours spent on flight testing.
