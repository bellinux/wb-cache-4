Chaudhry wanted to approach Younis Butt to write the series, but the director of the show and his friend Zain Ahmad persuaded him to write it himself, so Chaudhry wrote the show himself.He recollected the memories of Jutt and Bond while speaking to a newspaper [...] "So, then I sat down to make the decision and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the terrible dramas I have seen in my life.

50|$|Eaton was the Los Angeles mayor from 1898 to 1900. For the office, he {{ran on the}} {{platform}} of establishing a new municipal water system {{for the city of}} Los Angeles. One year later in 1899, a 2.09 million US dollar bond measure was approved by city voters for the purchase of Los Angeles City Water Company’s system. (the private water company that leased the city's waterworks and provided water to the city) A few years later, Los Angeles was faced with a problem: a burgeoning population that threatened the city’s water supply. Desperate to find a new water source for the city, Eaton recalled a camping trip in the Sierras where he “gazed down upon the Owens Lake and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the freshwater flowing into it and going to waste. Yes, Los Angeles was some 200 miles away, but it was all downhill. All one would have to do to move it to the city was dig some canals, lay some pipe and let gravity do the rest.” In other words, Eaton realized an opportunity to sustain Los Angeles’ growth and took matter into his own hands to save the city.|$|E

[...] Burnett {{went on to say that}} he felt Calgary's arts community had finally started to come into its own but expressed concern about the integrity of art making. Finally, when asked what he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the new types of poets - punk-poets, club-poets, spoken-word artists and the like - Burnett said, [...] "For a long time it was poet, before the hyphen. Over the years, there has been an explosion of club-poets, punk-poets, poetry slams, workshops, etc. That has been great - spoken word had been meant to be a more inclusive term," [...] says Burnett. [...] "But for myself, I am a poet first, performer second. I recognize that poetry can wear many hats. I just have never felt a need to hyphenate myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Early {{analysis}} {{questioned whether}} entrapment by FBI operatives was involved, an Oregonian columnist asking [...] "how far would Mohamud have traveled {{down that road}} {{without the help of}} those very operatives?" [...] Noting [...] "astonishing similarities" [...] to a simultaneous case near Baltimore, Maryland, The Oregonian quoted a New York University expert that such cases were [...] "a strategy the FBI set upon years ago." [...] Presumably aware of legal defenses based on issues of entrapment, FBI agents reportedly offered Mohamud multiple alternatives to a bombing with mass casualties, including prayer. Mohamud reportedly insisted he wanted to play an [...] "operational" [...] role, and even wanted to pick the target for the bombing. He had also been told several times that his planned bomb could kill women and children, and was given multiple opportunities to back out, but he told agents: [...] "Since I was 15 I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this... It's gonna be a fireworks show... a spectacular show." [...] Christopher Dickey of Newsweek said the FBI [...] "took no chances with the court of public opinion" [...] to make sure that Mohamud {{did not appear to be}} a victim of entrapment. Noting that key evidence from an alleged July 30 meeting may already be missing, a court ordered the FBI to preserve remaining media and recording equipment. Noting past behavior by the FBI in similar cases, New York lawyer Martin Stolar asserted the absence of such recordings was intentional. [...] "Once somebody's been induced, and they agree to do the crime, that's when the recording starts.... He's already been induced to commit the crime, so everything on the tape is shit." ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{something}} I really hadn’t done too much, but I sort of enjoy doing it. When I was putting together my repertoire for that, {{it seemed to}} me that the best thing I could do was to play these kind of jazzy things. Trying to be like a folk singer or sing country blues didn’t feel as right as doing this kind of jazzy thing.So maybe a year later, the woman who had booked the tour over there was working with some record companies over there, and called me up and said she wanted me to make a solo record for this label she was working with. I thought about it for a couple of days, and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> of those tunes, and thought, “Yeah, I can flesh that into an album.” I ended up making it for this French company instead, New Rose, and then licensed it to Ardent after they had heard it and really dug it. It was proposed to me, and there was some money involved, and I said, “Well, I can use that money, and I think I can do a good record.” So that’s how it came about....and studio owner Keith Keller was really kind of great about doing the record. I went in there thinking I was going to do it in one evening. But it’s so much harder to play on acoustic guitar than it is on electric. I wasn’t really in fighting form for that at all. I got in there, and after 45 minutes my hands were so fuckin’ sore, I could not go any further. He bore with me—we probably did 14 recording sessions to get 12 songs. He hung in there with me about it. I’m probably exaggerating about that, but it certainly wasn’t one evening like I envisioned.|$|E
40|$|Nine books {{addressing}} the specific harms linked to adults’ viewing of heterosexual pornography are examined. All were published since 2010, and range from {{some that are}} opposed to all pornography, to others that approve of pornography. The books differ considerably in scope, quality, and scientific rigor. Several include discussions of the feminist anti-pornography movement, in the U. S. and worldwide, from 1975 to the present. These accounts range from criticism of the anti-pornography movement to praise and appreciation. This collection of books provides a useful view of the remarkable diversity of <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> issues connected with pornography’s effects on adult viewers...|$|E
