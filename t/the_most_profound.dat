5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In {{the latter half of}} the sixteenth century, orchestration came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E

5000|$|... 1859 - Charles Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species {{regarding the}} theory of evolution, after over 20 years of research and discovery. Darwin was prompted to publish by the publication of an essay by Alfred Russel Wallace, which independently summarized the theory. <b>The</b> theory's <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> element, [...] "natural selection," [...] challenged the generally accepted idea of divine intervention in species formation, leading to strong reactions to Darwin's theory.|$|R
25|$|The sole {{subject of}} his {{philosophy}} is living subjectivity, {{which is to say}} the real life of living individuals.

25|$|Worldwide, the Great Depression had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> {{impact in}} the German Reich and the United States. In both {{countries}} the pressure to reform {{and the perception of}} the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} effect {{was that the}} politically weakened Commission was unable {{to react to the}} beginning of the Kosovo War and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound,</b> the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.|$|E
25|$|The First Great Awakening divided Congregationalists {{into the}} pro-revival New Lights and the anti-revival Old Lights (who were {{themselves}} divided between tradtional, Old Calvinists and liberal Calvinists who leaned toward Arminianism). It was New Light theologian and revivalist Jonathan Edwards {{who would have}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> affect on New England Congregationalism in the post-Awakening period.

25|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> {{impact to}} date of brain morphometry on our {{understanding}} of the relationships between brain structure and function has been provided by a series of VBM studies targeted at proficiency in various performances: Licensed taxicab drivers in London were found to exhibit bilaterally increased gray matter volume in the posterior part of the hippocampus, both relative to controls from the general population and to London bus drivers matched for driving experience and stress levels. Similarly, gray matter changes were also found to correlate with professional experience in musicians, mathematicians and meditators, and with second language proficiency.|$|E
25|$|The African influence, which {{introduced}} anatomical simplifications, {{along with}} expressive features reminiscent of El Greco, are the generally assumed {{starting point for}} the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. But that wasn't all. Aside from further influences of the Symbolists, Pierre Daix explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of Claude Lévi-Strauss on the subject of myth. And too, without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism came not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> layers of the psyche.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} single event to occur during the 19th century, and the one with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profound</b> repercussions was {{the coming of the}} potato blight, and following famine. Immediately prior to the famine some 425 souls were recorded as inhabiting the townland in the 1841 census. On 6 September 1845 the first occurrence of blight was recorded in the County, and the district as well as surrounding areas were affected soon thereafter. By the 1851 census, the population was recorded as having declined to 346, and this reduced by almost half (on the 1841 figure) to 214 in 1901. The famine hit poor in the area hardest with stories circulating over a century later of the destitute starving with their mouths turned green, having resorted to eating grass. As well as bringing hunger and emigration, the famine brought about longstanding changes in the settlement patterns of the area, with the disappearance of stores and shibeens which had existed prior to the mid-1840s, but disappeared with population decline and the abandonment of marginal land for cultivation.|$|E
