40|$|A {{tubular reactor}} was {{designed}} and constructed in order that the decomposition of hydrocarbon gases and vapours could be studied. Product distributions and kinetic data obtained from the cracking of n-butane agreed with the values available in the literature. Prom these results a reaction mechanism for the thermal decomposition of n-butane was proposed. The cracking of 2, 2 -dimethylbutane was investigated and a reaction mechanism postulated following the acquisition of product spectra and the calculation of kinetic data. This mechanism differed from others found in the literature. Base etioporphyrin was synthesised by two unrelated routes. A concentrate containing approximately two per cent petroporphyrins was isolated from Tia Juana Pesado <b>topped</b> <b>crude.</b> After demonstrating that porphyrins are thermally stable up to a temperature of 5 ^ 0 G the effects of nine different porphyrin species towards the cracking of 2, 2 -dimethylbutane were examined. All nine were shown to act as cracking catalysts. Following consideration of the product distributions and kinetic data obtained {{from the study of}} porphyrin catalysis a reaction mechanism has been proposed. This is based on increasing the rate of homolytic bond cleavage. Porphyrins were shown to catalyse the decomposition of 1 -hexene over the temperature range 325 to 450 °C. At a temperature of 150 °C three porphyrins catalysed the hydrogenation of 1 -hexene. ...|$|E

40|$|NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) Waste Policies for {{the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas {{producing}} states have been in existence since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, when Louisiana was {{the first state to}} develop a NORM regulatory program in 1989. Since that time, expectations for NORM Waste Policies have evolved, as Health, Safety, Environment, and Social responsibility (HSE 2 ̆ 6 SR) grows increasingly important to the public. Therefore, {{the oil and gas industry}} 2 ̆ 7 s safety and environmental performance record will face challenges in the future, about its best practices for managing the co-production of NORM wastes. ^ Within the United States, NORM is not federally regulated. The U. S. EPA claims it regulates NORM under CERCLA (superfund) and the Clean Water Act. Though, there are no universally applicable regulations for radium-based NORM waste. Therefore, individual states have taken responsibility for developing NORM regulatory programs, because of the potential radiological risk it can pose to man (bone and lung cancer) and his environment. This has led to inconsistencies in NORM Waste Policies as well as a NORM management gap in both state and federal regulatory structures. ^ Fourteen different NORM regulations and guidelines were compared between Louisiana and Texas, the nation 2 ̆ 7 s top two petroleum producing states. Louisiana is the country 2 ̆ 7 s <b>top</b> <b>crude</b> oil producer when production from its Federal offshore waters are included, and fourth in crude oil production, behind Texas, Alaska, and California when Federal offshore areas are excluded. Louisiana produces more petroleum products than any state but Texas. For these reasons, a comparative analysis between Louisiana and Texas was undertaken to identify differences in their NORM regulations and guidelines for managing, handling and disposing NORM wastes. Moreover, this analysis was undertaken because Texas is the most explored and drilled worldwide and yet appears to lag behind its neighboring state in terms of its NORM Waste Policy and developing an industry standard for handling, managing and disposing NORM. As a result of this analysis, fourteen recommendations were identified. ...|$|R
40|$|Exports {{of crude}} oil account for one-third of the {{combined}} Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and two-thirds of their total exports. The economic crisis in Euro-zone and decelerating economic growth in emerging markets in Asia have led oil exporters from MENA to focus on security of demand for their exportable quantity {{of crude oil}}. Oil security in international relations theories is related {{to a number of}} approaches, which are often overlapping and coexistent. The general perception (hypothesis) about oil security from the oil exporters’ perspective is that, it is closely associated with uninterrupted exports (demand) of their produced oil at a reasonable price for economic well-being (security) of its citizens. Therefore, the theorisation of ‘security’ for oil exporters would generally involve proving empirically, the influence of crude oil exports on economic well-being of the citizens. There is restricted amount of literature that empirically tests how the dynamic change in export quantity of crude oil affects economic well-being of the citizens of oil exporting countries of the MENA region. This paper is an attempt to fill this literature gap by finding the causal relationship between oil export quantity (proxy to oil security) and per capita GDP (proxy to economic well being), of the <b>top</b> five <b>crude</b> oil exporters of MENA region, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and UAE in order to consolidate or contradict the general perception of oil security from the net oil exporters perspective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present project {{explains}} how crude biodiesel (crude BD) has been obtained by using coconut oil and ethyl alcohol {{as well as}} sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. The coconut oil was extracted with water which was submitted to evaporation afterwards. This experiment {{was carried out by}} adding the coconut oil in a 500 mL glass flask. The catalyst was dissolved in ethyl alcohol and mixed together with the coconut oil. Once obtained the mixture, this was stirred for 25 minutes at temperatures from 20, 30, 40, 50 to 60 ºC. During the reaction, two phases were formed: <b>crude</b> biodiesel (<b>top</b> layer) and <b>crude</b> glycerol (bottom layer). The characterization was done by determination of pH (using an electrode located in the top layer connected to a computer by RS- 232 interface system). When the separation concluded, the crude BD was rinsed in order to remove the catalyst. The characterization of washed biodiesel was determined by density and Saybolt viscosity. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis was also made. The results by FTIR indicated the two functional groups of fatty acid ethyl esters (C=O, 1733 cm- 1 and C-O, 1154 cm- 1) and the OH wide band group of glycerol at 3400 cm- 1. When the reaction time ended, the maximum pH value registered was 12. 7. The values for pH, density and Saybolt viscosity were acceptable for crude BD and crude glycerol...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} main {{causes of death}} in workers from {{different}} industries in Guangzhou. METHODS: The industrial systems in Guangzhou were classified into six categories according to the Chinese Public Health Inspection Statistical Report. Baseline data on 79, 547 workers, age > or = 35, were retrieved from individual health records under the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established in 1989 - 1992. In this prospective cohort study, the workers' vital status and causes of death were followed up until 31 December 1998. Using SPSS 10. 0, crude death rates were calculated and relative risks(RR) (95 % CI) were estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models. RESULTS: (1) Among 79, 547 workers were 49, 355 men and 30, 192 women, with mean age of (43. 8 +/- 6. 5) years, and 64 % were aged 35 - 44. The mean age difference of workers in different industries was +/- 1 year. At baseline, 41 % had been exposed to occupational hazards. Exposure was most prevalent in petroleum chemical industry(53. 9 %), followed by metallurgical industry, and the lowest exposure was in mechanical industry (30. 2 %). (2) The mean follow-up period was (8. 0 +/- 1. 3) years with 633, 510 person-years. 1, 577 workers had died with a total death rate of 248. 9 per 100, 000 person-years. The death rate in rubber industry was the highest, followed by metallurgical and petroleum chemical industries. Malignant neoplasms, vascular and respiratory diseases were most common, constituting 80. 3 % of all causes of death. (3) For all causes of death and the three main categories, the <b>top</b> three <b>crude</b> death rates were observed in rubber and petroleum chemical industries, and in the metallurgical industry except for vascular causes. The rubber industry had the highest crude death rate for all and vascular causes, and the metallurgical industry for malignant neoplasms and respiratory causes. (4) With the light industry as a reference (RR = 1. 0), the metallurgical industry had the highest adjusted relative risks (RR) (95 % CI) of 1. 62 (1. 20 - 2. 18) and 7. 42 (3. 38 - 16. 31) for malignant neoplasms and respiratory causes, respectively. The rubber industry had the highest RR of 1. 69 (1. 40 - 2. 04) for all causes. A significant RR of 2. 03 (1. 43 - 2. 88) for vascular causes was observed only in the rubber industry. CONCLUSIONS: The {{main causes of death}} varied from industry. Malignant neoplasms and respiratory diseases were the leading causes in metallurgical and petroleum chemical industries. In rubber industry, vascular and respiratory causes were most common. Preventive measures for disease control should be tailor-made for each industry. 目的　比較廣州市不同工業行業職工的主要死因。方法　將廣州市工業系統參照中國衛生監督統計報告表行業分類分為 6 個行業,以 1989 ～ 1992 年實施職業健康監護系統中建立的 795 4 7 名年齡≥ 35 歲的工廠職工個體健康檔案為基礎資料,按前瞻性隊列研究方法,隨訪至 1998 年 12 月 31 日,登記隊列中職工的生存狀態和死亡原因,計算粗死亡率,用Cox比例風險模型計算RR及 95 %CI。結果　 (1) 795 4 7 名職工中,男 4 935 5 人、女 30 192 人,平均年齡 (43. 8 ± 6. 5) 歲, 6 4 %的職工年齡在 35 ～ 4 4 歲,各行業職工年齡相近,相差± 1 歲; 4 1 %的職工接觸職業有害因素,石化行業職業有害因素接觸率最高 (5 3. 9 %),冶金行業次之,機械行業最低 (30. 2 %) 。 (2) 截至 1998 年 12 月 31 日,平均追蹤 (8. 0 ± 1. 3) 年,共 6 335 10 人年;共有 15 77 名職工死亡,總死亡率為 2 4 8. 9 / 10 萬人年,其中橡膠行業總死亡率最高,其次為冶金和石化行業,主要死因為惡性腫瘤、血管疾病和呼吸系統疾病,占總死亡人數的 80. 3 %。(3) 全死因和血管疾病的粗死亡率橡膠行業排第一位,惡性腫瘤和呼吸系統疾病粗死亡率則為冶金行業排第一位。 (4) 調整各相關因素后,以輕工行業為對照(RR為 1. 0),發現冶金行業的惡性腫瘤和呼吸系統疾病的要死因為血管疾病, 其次是呼吸系統疾病;工業行業職工疾病的控制應有針對性。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
