It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> me to move on.|$|E

25|$|International {{isolation}} was keenly {{felt by the}} South African team at the time, including Pollock, and {{the players}} took measures to try to reverse the looming sporting boycott. In 1971, Pollock {{took part in a}} protest organised by Barry Richards and Mike Procter against the South African government's apartheid policy as it referred to cricket. During a match to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Republic of South Africa, the players from both teams walked off after one ball, issuing a joint statement: We cricketers feel that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> an expression of our views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association's application to invite non-whites to tour Australia, if they are good enough, and further subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "The fragrance concept is a about female empowerment and finding the inner strength that makes women so beautiful... We're getting a little bit more intimate and personal with this next initiative we are doing. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> something more natural and emotional."

500|$|After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira {{return to}} the elven capital Ellesméra to train. There, Saphira {{revealed}} from a memory that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, is Eragon's father; which Brom asked her to show him when the time was right. Oromis and Glaedr too justify Saphira's revelation. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, or heart of hearts. An Eldunarí allows the holder to communicate with or draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased, or a great distance away. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, and forcing the deceased dragons to channel their energy to him through their Eldunari. Saphira is delighted to learn {{of the existence of}} the dragons, although imprisoned by Galbatorix's dark magics. After training, Eragon visits Rhunön, the elven blacksmith who forges swords for Riders. But Rhunön wouldn't create a weapon for him because long ago she swore an oath never to create a weapon again after the Fall of the Riders. Also her stocks of the metal, required to forge rider's swords was completely exhausted. But by deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions Eragon is able to acquire the metal he requires, from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. After Eragon's repeated requests, Rhunön creates a weapon by controlling Eragon's body. Eragon gives a name to the sword,"Brisingr." [...] As Eragon's body itself forged the sword, a special bond between the sword and Eragon had been created, thus making the sword burst into flames whenever Eragon utters Brisingr, even when he does not intend to use magic. Oromis suspects that [...] "Brisingr" [...] is part of the sword's true name. Before Eragon and Saphira depart for the Varden, Oromis says that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> him and Glaedr to openly oppose the Empire in combat alongside the Queen of the Elves, Islanzadí. Thus, Glaedr gives his own Eldunari to Eragon. If anything should happen to Glaedr, Eragon would still be able to get advice from him. Then Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, the city that the Varden are laying siege to.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "occupational health psychology" [...] first {{appeared}} in print in 1986 when Everly advocated for psychologists' role in workplace health promotion.

When this change was coupled with an increased recognition of the impact of stress on a range of problems in the workplace, NIOSH found that their stress-related programs were significantly increasing in [...] prominence. In 1990, Raymond et al. argued that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> doctoral-level psychologists to get interdisciplinary OHP training, integrating health psychology with public health, because creating healthy workplaces should be a goal for the field.|$|E
