Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> form of narration.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of question search. In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question. In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying question <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> question focus. More specifically, we first summarize questions in a data structure consisting of question <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> question focus. Then we model question <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> question focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying question <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> question focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying question <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> question focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR). ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus in sentence processing, with particular attention to Hungarian. It is proposed that sentence <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> contrastive focus have a privileged relation to any prior discourse-related phrases, allowing them to influence the processing of the current sentence. The dissertation describes a series of experiments designed to test a distinction in processing of the discourse-related phrases <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus on the one hand, and non-discourse-related (background) constituents on the other. I argue that <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus receive discourse-interpretation during their initial processing; by contrast, elements in the background (other than inherently discourse-related ones) are incorporated into the discourse only after the entire proposition has been processed. This has important consequences for the types of information used by the parser when processing <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus vs. background. In particular, I propose that topic plays a distinguished role in constructing the contrast set for a contrastively focused item. ^ The privileged role of <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus is argued to follow from a syntactic property of Hungarian, namely, the structural marking of <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus. This allows the parser to identify the discourse-related status of <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus {{as soon as they}} are encountered. Immediate discourse interpretation of <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> focus is further related to the possibility of multiple filler-gap dependencies in Hungarian, which raises special issues in processing complexity and memory limitations. I examine some grammatical and parsing principles necessary to interpret simultaneous dependencies between two <b>topics</b> or wh-phrases <b>and</b> their traces. I propose that the parser constructs temporary memory buffers on the spot for each type of A'-dependency (topic, wh-phrase) separately, to help relieve the burden on immediate memory posed by a series of unassigned fillers. ...|$|R

Method. The qualitative analysis was done on the basis of the sequence of the uncertainty and certainty <b>and</b> the <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> comment in the user's utterances during the interaction in order to explore the use of these elements. Results. The findings suggested some patterns in the employment of uncertainty <b>and</b> certainty <b>and</b> <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> comment. Users initiated the need description with uncertainty and then provided certainty to describe the need in detail.

The study confirmed that the user's certainty and uncertainty are important for describing the user's information need <b>and</b> that both <b>topic</b> <b>and</b> comment are essential to communicate the need...|$|R
5|$|Created in {{the early}} 1930s, the salon {{was taken over by}} SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his {{subordinate}} Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence. The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries, foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> individuals. Notable guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The building housing the salon was destroyed in an air raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance. Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E

5|$|Kanti (1108), {{known for}} her wit and humour, {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} female poets of the Kannada language and a contemporary of Nagachandra, with whom she indulged in debates and repartees. Rajaditya, a native of either Puvinabage or Raibhag (the modern Belgaum district), was in the Hoysala court during the days of King Veera BallalaI and King Vishnuvardhana. He wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> is credited with three of the earliest writings on mathematics in the Kannada language: Vyavaharaganita, Kshetraganita and Lilavati. Udayaditya, a Chola prince, authored a piece on rhetoric called Udayadityalankara (1150). It was based on Dandin's Sanskrit Kavyadarsa.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

Williams came for voice recording sessions during {{breaks in the}} shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given <b>topics</b> <b>and</b> dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs.

He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 12thcentury, {{important}} socio-political changes {{took place in}} the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the Malnad region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power. They are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10thcentury when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas of Tanjore and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), thus bringing the region back under native rule. In the following decades, with the waning of the Chalukya power, the Hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew {{into one of the most}} powerful ruling families of southern India. Consequently, literature in Kannada, the local language, flourished in the Hoysala empire. This literature can be broadly subdivided as follows: works dominated by the themes of Jain writings, contrasting works by Veerashaiva writers not belonging to the vachana poetic tradition, rebuttals to Shaiva writings from Jain writers, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the Bhakti (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, writings on secular <b>topics,</b> <b>and</b> the first writings in native metres (ragale, sangatya and shatpadi).|$|E
