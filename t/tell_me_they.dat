5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the battery}} is glued in and cannot be easily {{disassembled}} for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's {{ability to be}} recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple [...] "has pitted design against the environment—and chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue." [...] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating [...] "he design may well be [...] 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'—but my friends in the electronics recycling industry <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{have no way of}} recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were going to do this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going off}} for a few hours," [...] he said more seriously. [...] "Dr. Tredway <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> do not look for any developments--for the worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} they say? You need not think that you will shock <b>me</b> by <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> cannot say worse there than people have said here,--or think worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{words are}} wise, fair Queen," [...] replied Claus, [...] "and my heart <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> are as {{just as they}} are wise. Hereafter all {{children}} may claim my services." ...|$|R
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|After {{the pilot}} was released, Jones found that people back in Fargo were amused to spot the {{differences}} in landmarks between their city and Downer. Jones told Lamb that since he worked in animation, he has been [...] "surrounded by these people that I've looked up to for years as a fan, and having them <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed it is the greatest thing ever". , Jones is still mainly working on Regular Show but {{said that he would}} like it very much to have the network commission it as a series. He expressed interest in submitting it at the Fargo Film Festival. The pilot was listed in the ballot for [...] "Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program" [...] at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, although it did not win. The Long Live the Royals pilot did win in this category, however, and the network later commissioned it as a miniseries of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Sadly, I am not {{acquainted with}} any of the [...] [...] [...] [...] Old priests <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were once the up-and-coming generation. Does it {{threaten}} them that somebody like myself, a [...] of 28, now rejects their complacent, characterless, and crumbling compromise between Church and modern Ireland? [...] [...] [...] We call a person cheap not because they look cheap but because their actions are cheap. I call the President of Ireland cheap because her behaviour in Rome towards her host, the Bishop of Rome, was a cheap travesty of respect and a cheap personal propaganda stunt from start to finish.|$|E
6000|$|... "A great deal, {{it would}} seem; since she <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> are fast friends; quite as great, I should judge from Miss Bayard's {{language}} and manner, as Kate and herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, Poodles," [...] {{said the}} man perched on the fender. [...] "A Johnny I know <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> 're nothing to Sofia." [...] His face was transfigured by the subtle gloating of a man enjoying vice by proxy.|$|R
2500|$|... "It's {{basically}} a track from {{lots of different}} girls' stories out there. A {{lot of people are}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> can relate to the track and they've been in that situation, but it's also got an element of fun in it." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{a flurry}} of {{interest}} in the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) and air taxi markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the Embraer Phenom 100, the Cessna Citation Mustang, and the Eclipse 500. However, following the late 2000s recession the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both Eclipse Aviation and air taxi firm DayJet collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term very light jet has lost favor in the aviation industry. [...] "Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ—very light jet—much anymore and some people in the industry <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} {{want to get}} away from EVERYTHING, do you? I myself feel so LOST sometimes--so dreadfully alone: not in a silly sentimental fashion, because men keep <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> love <b>me,</b> don't you know. But my LIFE seems alone, for some reason--" ...|$|R
60|$|For my reason <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> are, {{and have}} {{continued}} a true prophecy, {{from the day}} that they were related; otherwise the world could not have subsisted; for take away seed time and harvest, cold and heat, &c., and an end is put to the[38] beginning of the universe.|$|R
60|$|W.A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed;--my wife {{assures me}} of the contrary, and that they abhor it. Perhaps for any further {{relations}} {{they may not be}} so exact as we are; but she <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> never touch one another in the near relations you speak of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{his uncle}} exclaimed, as he entered, [...] "I suppose {{you have been}} sent to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> have got {{to the bottom of this}} {{rigmarole}} affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There will be {{a little}} bac going on," [...] he continued--"un petit bac de santé; and these boys <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> have never played {{anything}} more elevating than loo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{captured}} {{you in the}} battle, though I {{expect that}} was by your own will as you had wearied of those Chancas. For what laso can hold a god?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Going for a ride, eh?" [...] {{came from}} Dave's uncle, Dunston Porter, {{who had just}} {{finished}} a belated lunch. [...] "Well, have a good time, and don't let that pair of grays run away with you. John was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> are feeling quite mettlesome lately. I guess they don't get exercise enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guy has had {{his share}} of fighting, at any rate," [...] Lord Eustace said, {{as he entered the}} room while the girl was speaking, [...] "for fifteen of our men have fallen; and, as Long Tom <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> had hot work of it, and gained much credit by {{capturing}} single-handed a great French ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My good friend,' {{returned}} Martin, 'did I want {{to receive}} them? Was it any act of mine? Didn't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> would rile up, and that I should be flayed {{like a wild}} cat--and threaten all kinds of vengeance, if I didn't receive them?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is strange}} that your {{soldiers}} fight so well when, as you <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> never carry arms until {{they enter the}} army; while ours are trained from childhood {{in the use of}} weapons. And your enemies, the French, is it the same with them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{look like}} the uniforms our folks brought home from Putnam Hall," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "My father's old uniform is up in our storeroom now. I tried it on one day just for fun. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> are patterned after the uniforms worn at West Point." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{can see the}} American Dream {{slipping}} away ... People are <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> want to restore common sense and some degree of sanity. People {{are sick and tired}} of the noise. The country’s confused. We’re overregulated and overtaxed, and people are just sick to their stomach because gridlock has become a political virus that has infected Washington.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have some}} new photographs, and I {{want you to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> whether <b>they</b> are good,' she said. 'Mind you are to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> truly, and no favour.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>they</b> {{have got}} a dandy hotel there--something new," [...] said Sam. [...] "We ought to get {{first-class}} accommodations there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plenty to do. But I'm {{not paid}} for it. I walk {{a great number}} of blocks and jump into {{a great number of}} cars and dive into {{elevators}} and dive out again and open doors and say 'Good morning' when people <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> haven't a job for me.
