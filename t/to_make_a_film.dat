5|$|As {{the series}} wound down, Telefe {{considered}} a theatrical version for the 2013 summer season. It {{would have been}} similar to a 2010 version by the producers of Valientes, but the cast had other commitments. Telefe then asked series creator Sebastian Ortega <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film.</b> Negotiations were confirmed by producer Pablo Culell, who said that although Underground produces television series it can also produce stage plays and films.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} film had been cancelled, Kamal Amrohi, one of the scriptwriters {{who was also a}} director, planned <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> on the same subject himself. When confronted by Asif, he agreed to shelve the project. Another {{unrelated}} film production based on the same stage play was Nandlal Jaswantlal's Anarkali, starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar, which became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1953.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{director}} Michael Cimino, Antonio Margheriti did {{not want}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> political <b>film</b> that was for or against the Vietnam War. He just wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Vietnam War <b>film</b> that was fun.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, TV producer, Andrew Coggins, {{had planned}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>filmed</b> drama {{about the plight}} of Ethiopian street children.

5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> {{about the}} life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson.

5|$|After the {{financial}} backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following {{the release of}} Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot {{was influenced by the}} films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono. Woo desired <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of his {{previous}} film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi was offered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> largely from such a perspective.|$|E
5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart a chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E

At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

Berman's wife convinced him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> with Presley {{starring in the}} leading role. Berman contacted Presley's manager, Colonel Thomas Parker, {{and asked if he}} could send Presley or Parker the script to read it. Parker was uninterested and denied the request. Berman asked Parker under which conditions would he take the project, to which Parker replied that he was only interested in the music score of the movie and owning the rights for record sales and publishing royalties.

Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star.

Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E

5|$|MTV {{reported}} in February 2008 that Summit Entertainment intended {{to create a}} series {{of at least three}} films based on Meyer's books. The studio had optioned New Moon, the second book in the series, by October 2008, and confirmed their plans <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> based on it November 22, 2008. Because Catherine Hardwicke had wanted more preparation time than Summit's schedule for the production and release of the sequel would provide, Chris Weitz was selected to direct it in December 2008.|$|E
