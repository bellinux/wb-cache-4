40|$|Diabetic {{patients}} are {{nearly three times}} as likely to have depression as their nondiabetic counterparts. Patients with diabetes are already at risk for poor cardiovascular health. Using cross-sectional data from the translating research into action for diabetes (TRIAD) study, the authors tested the association of depression with cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. Depression was measured using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ 8). Patients who scored greater than 9 on the PHQ 8 were classified as depressed and <b>were</b> compared with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> depressed (n= 2, 341). Depressed patients did not have significantly different blood pressure levels than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> depressed. However, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> depressed had higher HbA 1 c levels than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> depressed (P < 0. 01) and higher BMIs than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> depressed (P < 0. 01). These results indicate that depressed diabetic {{patients are}} at greater risk of having poor control of cardiovascular risk factors and suggest that depression screening should be a standard practice among this patient group. © 2012 Lindsay B.

5|$|Crest badges {{consist of}} a crest and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. Crest badges may be worn by anyone; however, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a crest badge surrounded by a strap and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a crest badge surrounded by a plain circlet.

It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
25|$|Varicella vaccine, {{also known}} as {{chickenpox}} vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against chickenpox. One dose of vaccine prevents 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease. Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> immune within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating {{a large portion of}} the population also protects <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin.|$|E
