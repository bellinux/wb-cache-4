40|$|When {{blogging}} tools {{first arrived}} in 1998, people asked “What’s a blog?” The word “blog” is a contraction of “Web log” and is used both as a noun {{as well as a}} verb. To blog is to write content to a blog. By design, blogs are best suited for the spontaneous thoughts and observations of an individual or team. They are not designed to facilitate rapid-fire back-and-forth discussion on a particular issue. Blogging tools are available as free or moderately priced services and as products you purchase and install on your own server.

40|$|In April of 20001 dined at {{a trendy}} ("hot") San Francisco {{restaurant}} with {{a senior vice president}} of an Internet company. A NASDAQ "darling, " the company's stock had increased in value 2, 800 percent over a few years and had split several times. A man of enormous energy, trained with a doctorate in a traditional academic field, but working far from its subject matter creating new web products, he is probably typical of the new breed: completely enthusiastic about his work; doing it 80 hours a week; dashing around the globe developing clients and partners; constantly extending the reach of the firm and then madly expanding its capacity to catch up with its new commitments. In short, a player in the new economy. "You're a globalization guy too, " he observed, as we were meeting for the first time through the invitation of a third party. I opined as if that might be true, but perhaps of a different sort than he. "What's <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>about?</b> " I asked. "The land grab, " he replied. "You stake as many claims as you can think of, and then work to nail them down. " "Who is in charge? " I asked. "No one " he replied. Thus spake a denizen of the new economy. For him, globalization is a condition, fully arrived upon the world, not so much to be questioned, as it is an inevitable or necessary outcome of our current world. Once—the story seems to go—there was the old economy, and now there is the new. For him the new economy is inseparable from the information and telecommunications industry: globalization is the new economy and the new economy is IT (Information and Telecommunications) ! And San Francisco is but a boom town on the frontier o...|$|E

40|$|The X and Y {{chromosome}} {{are in a}} tight {{battle for}} evolutionary supremacy, according to a developing theory. Genes on the X chromosome that confer a survival advantage are counteracted by corresponding genes on the Y—and vice versa. Much of this conflict seems {{to take place in}} the testes, involving genes that affect sperm fitness. The genomic sequences of the X and Y contain signs of this conflict, with the Y chromosome of several species containing a set of highly amplified genes expressed only during sperm production, and the X containing counterpart amplified genes. Perhaps nobody understands this X-Y conflict better than David Page, director of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We spoke to Page about his research on sex chromosomes and the germline, and his view of the "Evolution of Sex, " the theme of the meeting, which took place June 18 – 22 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2014 you published the mouse Y chromosome sequence, overcoming technical hurdles to catalog its amplified sequences, which make up about 95 percent of the chromosome. What struck you about those results [1 - 3]? There is an outrageous commitment of real estate within the mouse genome to a small number of proteins that are expressed during sperm production. These genes have not been on the Y throughout its 200 million year history, but instead have been acquired by the Y chromosome and amplified, probably during rodent evolution. We also saw that there are counterpart genes that are amplified on the mouse X chromosome. Those X genes are relatively recent immigrants to the X—they have been acquired by the X and amplified on the X. These genes are also expressed exclusively during sperm production. So what is <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>about?</b> We think this is evidence of a kind of arms race between the X and Y chromosomes [...] . Many other labs have contributed to this bigger picture I am describing. You are also sequencing the sex chromosomes of seven other mammals and the chicken, and at the meeting presented data on the bull. What are all these new data telling you? (SSR 2015 65 : "Th...|$|E
