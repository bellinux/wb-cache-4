Samaha acknowledged that [...] "everyone <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> or mentally retarded" [...] for taking on the project, but pitched the film as [...] "Planet of the Apes starring John Travolta". Others in Hollywood were still skeptical; an unnamed producer was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying that [...] "Battlefield Earth has the stench of death. It {{should never have been}} made. It's an $80million vanity project for Travolta." [...] Travolta's theatrical agency William Morris was also said to be unenthusiastic, reportedly leading to Travolta threatening to leave them if they did not help him to set up the film. Fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise was said to have warned Warner Bros. that he thought the movie was a bad idea. Cruise's spokesperson later denied this.|$|E
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area.

The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

There {{appears to be a}} lack of research investigating how OCD is experienced by those living with the diagnosis, and in particular the experiences of young people diagnosed with OCD. Ten young people, aged 14 - 17 years old, with a diagnosis of OCD were recruited from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). The young people were interviewed and a Thematic Analysis (TA) was used to analyse data. Four themes were developed through the analysis. The first theme ???Traumatic and stressful life events??? found that 9 out of the 10 participants experienced {{at least one of the}} following three life events just prior to the development of their OCD: ???Hostility in the family???, ???Illness and death???, ???Bullying and friendlessness???. Four subthemes, ???Lack of understanding of the behaviour???, ???<b>Being</b> secretive???, ???<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>crazy???,</b> and ???Feeling different???, provided a richer understanding to the theme ???Responses to signs of OCD???. The four subthemes ???Feeling ???right??????, ???<b>I</b> <b>was</b> taking on all the responsibility???, ???It???s ruined everything???, ???Everyday life is now in my bedroom??? explored the third theme ???The battle of living with OCD???. The last theme ???Ambivalent relationship to help??? described the conflict that most participants had over exposure therapy and accommodation of their OCD. Lastly, most participants felt the long waiting time for help was frustrating. The theme is fully explored by the following three subthemes: ???Conflicts of exposure therapy???, ???Conflicts about accommodation of the OCD???, ???and ???Frustrations of long waiting lists???. The themes that emerged may provide important information for clinicians and the implications of the research findings are discussed. The strengths and limitations of the study are noted and there are suggestions for future research...|$|R

But we {{certainly}} did fall out at the time. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they <b>were</b> <b>crazy.</b> They <b>were</b> just walking away from something so big and successful. We'd had great success {{around the world and}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we <b>were</b> just breaking in a very, very big way. The collective dynamite of those four people, four people who could all write, who could all sing a hit song. In one band.(Yet) I think it becomes claustrophobic, in the fact that you're trying to perfect things and you're looking at each other and eventually you maybe say this relationship is a little too tight for me now, and I need to break away. And that's what in retrospect, I found out long after because I still speak to Godley and Creme who - Lol is my brother-in-law, so I've got to see him - but for quite a while we didn't talk. I just said you're out of your minds for leaving this band. We were on such a winning curve, Graham Gouldman and I had to decide, {{are we going to be}} 5cc? Are we gonna scrap the name completely? Well, we thought we, no, we'd better carry on because we, this is 10cc, we are 10cc, this band. Two of our members are leaving us and that's not our problem, but we've got to carry it on.|$|R
50|$|I have {{to admit}} now that I really couldn't handle the thing at all. <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> the least gifted person for the job; my hands are too big, and I don't have the {{necessary}} technique such an instrument required. In trying to operate this light, precise mechanism, I really felt like an elephant in a china closet. But I kept at it all week and practiced hard and after several days began to notice that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually playing {{what was on the}} page. What <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> doing before was simply playing legato and pedaling through. I saw the slurs, but, of course, I didn't want to create hiccups, which can happen so easily on the modern piano. Suddenly I found that I really didn't need much pedal and that the articulative pauses actually made the music more expressive.At the concert {{at the end of that}} first week, which was absolutely filled to overflowing, there was great enthusiasm. Nobody had ever seen such a thing. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> to myself that this was an opportunity to do something useful with my talents. This was in 1969, and I decided to buy one of these pianos and to seriously pursue playing it. For several years I took the instrument by Belt around and played it in colleges and small venues. It was, of course, viewed as a curiosity back then, and some people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit <b>crazy.</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing something fringe-y, but <b>I</b> also <b>thought</b> it <b>was</b> important and worth doing because there were aspects of this music that nobody could hear any more.|$|R

He was in a terrible state. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> <b>crazy.</b> He walked the floor and called on his saints and prayed. When I wanted to light a lamp he wouldn't let me. He was afraid I'd see his face. But I saw well enough in the moonlight. And I knew {{something}} had happened. So I soothed and coaxed him. He had been a man as close-mouthed as a stone. Yet then I got him to talk.... He had gone to Mary's, and upon entering, thought he heard some one with her. She didn't answer him at first. When he found her in her bedroom {{she was like a}} ghost. He accused her. Her silence made him furious. Then he berated her, brought down the wrath of God upon her, threatened her with damnation. All of which she never seemed to hear. But when he tried to touch her she flew at him like a she-panther. That's what he called her. She said she'd kill him! And she drove him out of her house.... He was all weak and unstrung, and I believe scared, too, when he came to me. She must have been a fury. Those quiet, gentle women are furies when they're once roused. Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hours up with him and finally he got over it. He didn't pray any more. He paced the room. It was just daybreak when he said the wrath of God had come to him. I tried to keep him from going back to Mary. But he went.... An hour later the women ran to tell me he had been found dead at Mary's door." ...|$|R
