[...] The Standards cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing. [...] The book also establishes standards related to testing operations including test design and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users. [...] Finally, the Standards cover topics related to testing applications, including psychological testing and assessment, workplace testing and credentialing, educational testing and assessment, and testing in program evaluation and public policy.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{prototype}} (serial VX158), {{powered by}} four Rolls-Royce Avon RA.2 engines of [...] of thrust and piloted by Tom Brooke-Smith, had its maiden flight on 10 August 1951. By this time, {{in the light}} of the latest knowledge, and the fact that the Valiant project was now proceeding well and only six months behind the Sperrin the judgement of the Air Ministry was that an insurance project was now no longer needed, and a decision was taken to order the Vickers Valiant instead of the Sperrin and the Sperrin project was cancelled, although the Ministry of Supply determined that the Sperrin would serve as a research aircraft. Work on the two prototypes was continued, with the second prototype (VX161) flying on 12 August 1952 with Sqn Ldr [...] "Wally" [...] Runciman at the controls, accompanied by Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Development</b> Engineer Malcolm Wild.

40|$|Abstract. Collaboratories are {{increasingly}} important as instruments for distributed work. They are highly complex socio-technical systems, in which often advanced ICTs {{need to be}} carefully tailored to subtle work practices and organizational structures. However, despite their importance and potential impact, not many successful examples of collaboratories exist. One key obstacle is {{the complexity of the}} <b>testbed</b> <b>development</b> process in which the collaboratory is to evolve. In this paper, we propose a method for collaboratory improvement. We show how conceptual graph theory can be used to help improve the <b>testbed</b> <b>development</b> process. ...|$|R
