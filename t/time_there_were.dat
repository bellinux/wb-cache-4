5|$|Aleister Crowley {{was highly}} {{prolific}} and {{wrote on the}} subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print. During his <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several who wrote on the subject, including U.S. O.T.O. Grand Master Charles Stansfeld Jones, whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller.|$|E

5|$|Leeds, {{like many}} {{industrial}} cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds {{may be attributed}} to the small size of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000. At the <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several larger settlements in Yorkshire such as Wakefield and York.|$|E
5|$|Once Ebbsfleet International railway station, also {{designed}} {{to serve the}} Kent region, had opened, only three trains a day to Paris and one to Disneyland Paris called at Ashford for {{a considerable amount of}} <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> fears that services at Ashford International might be further reduced or withdrawn altogether as Eurostar planned to make Ebbsfleet the new regional hub instead.|$|E

5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E
5|$|At that <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{about forty}} Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to a lesser degree. Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E

The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild reprimand.|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had come close to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the <b>time.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry {{service to}} New Jersey, people moved to locations along the Hudson River waterfront there. In 1986, waterfront settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service to Manhattan, under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction to board the NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper to New Jersey, Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E

5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more than 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, {{and only a few}} mills continue to operate.|$|E
5|$|During the Medieval period, {{the town}} was {{dominated}} by Chatteris Abbey, a small Benedictine nunnery dedicated to St Mary, built in 980 by Alfwen the niece of King Edgar and one of only eight nunneries mentioned in the Domesday Book. Throughout its existence, the abbey was comparatively poor compared to other foundations, {{due to a lack}} of royal patronage and a consequent lack of tithe estates. As a result, the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was surrendered to the king's commissioners in 1538, by which <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> eleven nuns in residence.|$|E

5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, as evidenced by the carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards. At this <b>time</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies of anonymity, most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this <b>time,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
