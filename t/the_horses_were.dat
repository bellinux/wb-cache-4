5|$|The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations {{throughout}} their history, {{each of which}} saved the breed from extinction. The first was in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals. In November 1797, the horses returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807. But then, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated three more times during the unsettled period that followed, resulting {{in the loss of}} many horses and the destruction of the written studbooks that documented bloodlines of horses prior to 1700. The horses finally returned to Lipica for good in 1815, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|At this point, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers {{charged the}} third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> rigorous and takes about eight months for each <b>horse.</b> [...] Initially, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in basic lead work, in which <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> taught {{to move at}} the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of <b>the</b> guide <b>horse,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> must <b>be</b> able to disregard any commands that would <b>be</b> unsafe to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and <b>the</b> handler.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> raising {{its head and}} neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this <b>is</b> when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> engaging its hindquarters.|$|R
50|$|Model, or in-hand classes - <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{judged on}} {{conformation}} and movement suitable {{for that of}} a hunter. <b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> only led in these classes, not ridden, and <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> presented for judging without a saddle.|$|R
5|$|Interest in the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{continued}} through World War II, and <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> used heavily during Norway's occupation by Germany. Breed numbers and interest diminished {{after the war}} as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals; however, a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers. In 1947, the National Dølehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed. As of 2002, there are approximately 4,000 registered Dole Gudbrandsdals, with around 175 new foals registered annually.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} police unit {{arrived at the}} site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{hundreds}} sent to hospital with malaria, many died, many recovered in hospital but later suffered a relapse {{and went to}} hospital again, many men were invalided home {{as a result of}} malaria, with their health badly undermined.With so many men sick amongst the British Empire forces, it became common for one man to be placed in charge of eight horses. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> fed newly threshed barley, which resulted in the deaths of 15 horses in Chaytor's Force, while a further 160 became seriously ill.|$|E
50|$|Ever willing, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} tool of man’s ingenuity. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> a {{beast of}} legend, taking {{on its own}} character, personality, emotion and mythology.However, {{with the advent of}} the steam engine <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> made obsolete, and now they are resigned to the realm of shows and races, a world of equestrian sport, a mere shadow of the beast’s former glory.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, {{to occur}} after the {{completion}} of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> fit to continue onto phase D. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> unfit, <b>the</b> panel would pull it from the competition.|$|R
30|$|When {{the age of}} <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> not {{classified}} (Table  6), a dependence for the storage of Se (liver) and Cd (renal cortex) on the age of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> detected (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
5|$|The Andalusian {{is closely}} related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has been used to develop many other breeds, {{especially}} in Europe and the Americas. Breeds with Andalusian ancestry include many of the warmbloods in Europe as well as western hemisphere breeds such as the Azteca. Over its centuries of development, the Andalusian breed has been selected for athleticism and stamina. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> originally used for classical dressage, driving, bullfighting, and as stock horses. Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including dressage, show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively in movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{rulers of}} Marwar and {{successful}} Rajput cavalry, were the traditional breeders of the Marwari. The Rathores were forced from their Kingdom of Kanauj in 1193, and withdrew into the Great Indian and Thar Deserts. The Marwari was vital to their survival, {{and during the}} 12th century they followed strict selective breeding processes, keeping the finest stallions {{for the use of}} their subjects. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> considered divine beings, and at times they were only allowed to be ridden by members of the Rajput families and the Kshatriyas warrior caste. When the Moguls captured northern India in the early 16th century they brought Turkoman horses that were probably used to supplement the breeding of the Marwari. Marwaris were renowned during this period for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. During the late 16th century, the Rajputs of Marwar, under the leadership of Moghul emperor Akbar, formed a cavalry force over 50,000strong. The Rathores believed that the Marwari horse could only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions– victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. Over 300years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica {{becoming part of}} Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.|$|E

5|$|The stable {{originally}} had stalls for 116 healthy and 12 ill horses. The stable was insured for 12,000 Norwegian speciedaler, twice the amount {{for the head}} office building. The wagon depot had space for 28 trams and 16 sleds. The 16 sleds were purchased between 1875 and 1879, and replaced the horsecars during the winter. The forge had space for two smiths and featured a small room where <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> shoed.|$|E
5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} {{was turned over}} to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the artificial lake over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and the artificial lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>horse's</b> armor <b>was</b> then discussed, with a frontlet, breastplate, and thigh-pieces. The {{belly of}} <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> also {{recommended}} {{to be protected}} with a saddle cloth. The limbs of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> should also <b>be</b> protected.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> 1950s <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> concreted over by Westbury Urban District Council, {{apparently}} {{as a way}} to save {{on long-term}} maintenance costs. Since then, the concrete has greyed over time, and it was thoroughly cleaned in 1993. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> vandalised when [...] "Stop This War" [...] was written in yellow across <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in capital letters in protest of the Iraq War. After the words <b>were</b> removed, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> noticeably grey with a white horizontal strip where the message had been. In November 2006, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> repainted and <b>the</b> 1950s damage was fully repaired, as was the white strip. <b>The</b> newly whitened <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> illuminated for a third time on the night the repairs were finished, this time by Second World War searchlights. In July 2010, the neck of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> vandalised when <b>the</b> word [...] "wonkey" [...] was written across it. This part of the neck had to be rewhitened in 2010, leading to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> having a whiter neck {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|R

5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} {{protected the}} horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Carolina Marsh Tacky or Marsh Tacky {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse, native to South Carolina. It {{is a member of}} the Colonial Spanish group of horse breeds, which also include the Florida Cracker Horse and the Banker horse of North Carolina. It is a small horse, well adapted for use in the lowland swamps of its native South Carolina. The Marsh Tacky {{developed}} from Spanish horses brought to the South Carolina coast by Spanish explorers, settlers and traders as early as the 16th century. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> used by the colonists during the American Revolution, and by South Carolinians for farm work, herding cattle and hunting throughout the breed's history.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Turkey {{he met with}} Skene, the British Vice-Consul, who had him introduced to Omar Pasha and invited to view the Turkish regiments. Nolan was not particularly impressed by them, judging the irregulars incapable of withstanding a Russian cavalry charge and finding the horses too small. He ordered 250 of them anyway, finding them appropriate for the British artillery {{if not for the}} cavalry. His report to Somerset (now Baron Raglan, and commander of the British forces in Turkey) included a proposal for a trip to Syria, where he claimed <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> more appropriate. This proposal was eventually agreed to, and he went to İskenderun on 9 May. When they arrived they discovered that Turkish officials had already bought most of the army horses in northern Syria, and so they continued on to Beirut and then Damascus. Even there, they failed to find horses of sufficient quality, and so they left the city on 21 May in hopes of making contact with the Bedouin. They left with a train of 292 horses, mostly bought from the 'Anizzah, and were met at Beirut by the steamship Trent and transported back to Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|Halter - also {{sometimes}} called [...] "conformation" [...] or [...] "breeding" [...] classes, the conformation of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> judged, {{with emphasis on}} both the movement and build of <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not ridden, but is led, shown in a halter by a handler controlling <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> from <b>the</b> ground using a lead rope.|$|R
50|$|The {{pattern is}} not {{completely}} stable. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> born another color (usually another leopard pattern), and the Varnish pattern gradually overtakes it by adulthood.

However, unlike the gray gene, the color does not get progressively lighter {{every year for the}} life of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> though it may look a bit different from year to year while <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> young.|$|R
5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded horses were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian horses were descendents of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although {{often referred to as}} ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
50|$|Stringhalt is {{a sudden}} flexion {{of one or}} both hind legs in <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> most easily seen while <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> walking or trotting. It is most evident when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> backing up slowly, turning on the {{affected}} leg, or suddenly frightened. It can involve one or both hind legs of <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> It <b>is</b> a spasmodic contraction of the lateral extensor tendons of the hind legs.|$|R
25|$|The longe line {{traveling}} from <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to <b>the</b> hand <b>is</b> {{held in the}} hand in which direction <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> moving (so if <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>were</b> to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something.|$|R
