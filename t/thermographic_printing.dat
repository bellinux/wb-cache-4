5000|$|<b>Thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> {{refers to}} {{two types of}} printing, both of which rely on heat to create the letters or images {{on a sheet of}} paper.|$|E
50|$|The use and {{marketing}} of stationery is being partly superseded by electronic media. Stationery is intrinsically linked to paper {{and the process of}} written, personalized communication, and many techniques of stationery manufacture are employed, of varying desirability and expense. The most familiar of these techniques are letterpress printing, embossing, engraving and <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> (often confused with thermography). Flat printing and offset printing are regularly used, particularly for low-cost or informal needs.|$|E
50|$|Proofreading {{cannot be}} fully cost {{effective}} where volume or unpredictable work flow prevents proofreaders from managing their own time. Examples are newspapers, <b>thermographic</b> trade <b>printing</b> of business cards, and network hubs. The problem {{in each of}} these environments is that jobs cannot be put aside to be re-read as needed. In the first two cases, volumes and deadlines dictate that all jobs be finished as soon as possible; in the third case, jobs presently on-site at the hub are hurried, regardless of their formal deadline, in favor of possible future work that may arrive unpredictably. Where proofs can programmatically be read only once, quality will randomly but persistently fall below expectations. Even the best and most experienced readers {{will not be able to}} be consistently accurate enough to justify premium pay.|$|R
50|$|Production {{technology}} can also moot {{the need to}} pay a premium for proofreading. In the example of <b>thermographic</b> business-card <b>printing,</b> even when there are no reprints, there is considerable wastage of paper and ink in preparing each of the press runs, which are separated by color. When (as often happens) there is unused space available on the plate, there is no increase in production cost for reprints that use that space. Only when reprints are so numerous that they push production staff into significant overtime would they increase costs. But significant overtime is usually the result of a high volume in new orders using up the eight-hour day. In such industries proofreading need only - and can only - make a marginal difference to be cost-effective. As for the customers, many will never return even when their jobs are perfect, and enough of those who do need a reprint will find the retailer's cost-saving price to be satisfactory enough to tolerate a late delivery.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} form a raised three {{dimensional}} image makes possible the use of modified processes, inks and substrates in fine art work, such as children’s books, business cards, postcards, and special type printing processes. If the raised image attains the required height and firmness, {{it can be used}} in printing of Braille characters. Production of three dimensional (3 D) images on a substrate can be accomplished by old fashioned embossing procedures, a process using hectographic or spirit duplicating masters, or raised Xerographic printing with thermally intumesced electroscopic powders. It may also be done employing three-dimensional imaging paper with randomly distributed fibers with uniformly dispersed unexpanded synthetic thermoplastic polymeric microspheres, <b>thermographic</b> processes, special <b>printing</b> processes, which work by building parts of light curable photo-polymer in layers, or heat transfer printing with thermally-expandable ink layer. Results from our laboratory show a modified formula of hot melt ink {{that can be used in}} 3 D thermal wax printing process to create raised images on the substrates. An extensive study of thermal behavior of the components of proposed phase change ink has been carried out...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> is {{a process}} that {{involves}} several stages but can be implemented in a low-cost manufacturing process. The process involves printing the desired designs or text with an ink that remains wet, rather than drying on contact with the paper. The paper is then dusted with a powdered polymer that adheres to the ink. The paper is vacuumed or agitated, mechanically or by hand, to remove excess powder, and then heated to near combustion. The wet ink and polymer bond and dry, resulting in a raised print surface similar to the result of an engraving process.|$|E
50|$|Engraving is {{a process}} that {{requires}} a design to be cut into a plate made of a relatively hard material. It is a technology with a long history and requires significant skill and experience. The finished plate is usually covered in ink, and then the ink is removed from all of the un-etched portions of the plate. The plate is then pressed into paper under substantial pressure. The result is a design that is slightly raised {{on the surface of the}} paper and covered in ink. Due to the cost of the process and expertise required, many consumers opt for <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing,</b> a process that results in a similarly raised print surface, but through different means at less cost.|$|E
5000|$|Thermo-Fax (very often Thermo fax) is 3M's trademarked {{name for}} a {{photocopying}} technology which was introduced in 1950. It {{was a form of}} <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> and an example of a dry silver process. [...] It was a significant advance as no chemicals were required, other than those contained in the copy paper itself. A thin sheet of heat sensitive copy paper was placed on the original document to be copied, and exposed to infrared energy. Wherever the image on the original paper contained carbon, the image absorbed the infrared energy when heated. The heated image then transferred the heat to the heat sensitive paper producing a blackened copy image of the original.|$|E
50|$|The sleeve was {{designed}} by Factory's designer Peter Saville. The band and Saville met in a Rochdale pub and exchanged ideas. Saville told them about a book of avant-garde musical scores which he'd come across. Andy McCluskey said that he sometimes wrote down the tunes he composed in a similar shorthand. This led to the unusual graphics that feature on the sleeve. Saville suggested to use shiny black ink on black paper. Both OMD and Tony Wilson didn't believe it could be done, but Saville persuaded a printer to do the job. The <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> was a success, but the place set on fire three times, so eventually only 5,000 sleeves were printed. The reissue sleeves were standard white on black printed sleeves.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} the specific moisture content of several different papers that were exposed to four different relative humidity environments at approximately 30 degrees centigrade. This was done in order to see if the amount of water present in a sheet of paper affects the drying rate of drying oil inks. This in turn was done so that we would be able to determine if the rate at which this ink dries and its corresponding increase in viscosity affected the tack or 2 ̆ 2 stickiness 2 ̆ 2 which is vital to <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> applications. The addition of moisture to paper as it is printed lithographically is known to retard the complete drying of drying oil inks. However, in this study, the concern was centered on the role of moisture hygroscopically trapped within the fibers of paper before it enters the lithographic press and its effect on the initial phases of ink drying where the applied ink film is at its tackiest. The relationship of the drying rate of drying oil ink to <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing</b> is rooted in the application of a finely ground plastic resin to a freshly printed ink film. Tack is usually an important consideration on the press due to the nature of the lithographic system and the principles of ink splitting and trapping. Here, however, the tack of the printed ink surface is of concern due to reception and required retention of plastic resin as is the procedure in <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing.</b> The goal of this endeavor was to more fully understand the influence paper moisture has on the tack of drying oil ink and to make conclusions on the conditions that prove to be preferable for maximum ink tack results...|$|E
40|$|The braille {{production}} {{system is a}} slow and antiquated process. The end product is expensive, heavy, and bulky. A new, more efficient braille {{production system}} was designed, using computerized transcription, <b>thermographic</b> <b>printing,</b> and automated binding and finishing. Computerized transcription programs are readily available {{from a variety of}} sources; automated binding and finishing is a common feature of modern printing technology. A series of experiments was performed to evaluate the physical qualities of the braille cells produced by thermography. An internal tearing resistance test and machinability test were also performed to study the effect of heat on the paper stock. The strength of embossed and thermographed braille dots was studied and a comparison made. A literature search was also conducted to study the chemical characteristics of the resin used to produce the raised braille cells. A newspaper article was transcribed into braille and printed by thermography. Braille readers were asked to evaluate the readability and the overall quality of the material produced. The result of the experiments indicated {{that it was possible to}} produce braille by thermography, and that in certain aspects the product obtained was superior to embossed braille. Thermographic braille was found to be of a quality level acceptable to the Dlajor 1 ty of the braille population sampled...|$|E
