5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} analyze the effects of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) finishing diets on the fatty acid profile of beef. Ribeye slices (m. Longissimus thoracis), <b>tenderloins</b> (m. Psoas major), and top blades (m. Infraspinatus) were analyzed. Calf-fed (Experiment 1) and yearling steers (Experiment 2) (n = 96 each) were allocated into three treatments of 0 %, 15 % or 30 % WDGS (DM basis) for each experiment. For all muscles, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels were higher in beef from animals fed 30 % WDGS. Except in <b>tenderloins</b> in Experiment 1, trans fatty acids increased linearly with level of WDGS in the diet. In addition, feeding WDGS increased all trans 18 : 1 fatty acid isomers except delta 14, which decreased. Feeding WDGS changes the fatty acid profile of beef, which has implications for color stability and shelf life...|$|R
