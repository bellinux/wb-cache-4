5|$|Additionally, Pocock {{lists the}} vernacular names ye and nigálya ponya (Nepal); thokya and thongwa (Limbu); oakdonga or wakdonka and woker (Bhotia); saknam sunam (Lepcha). Nigálya may {{originate}} from the Nepali word निङालो niṅālo or nĩgālo meaning {{a particular kind}} of small bamboo, namely Arundinaria intermedia, but also refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> small leopard, or cat-bear. The word pónya may originate from the Nepali word पञ्जा pajā meaning claw, or पौँजा paũjā meaning paw of an animal. Nigálya pónya may translate to bamboo claw or paw.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. It would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, creatures who travel through time in sleeping units that look like sarcophagi. The name Nephilim was drawn from the Old Testament and from various Jewish writings, where it refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> demon. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener.|$|E
5|$|Close {{to the end}} of the war, H.D. met {{the wealthy}} English novelist Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived {{together}} until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the father was not Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from war influenza. During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, Notes on Thought and Vision, which was unpublished until 1982. In this, she speaks of poets (herself included) as belonging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> elite group of visionaries with the power to 'turn the whole tide of human thought'.|$|E

25|$|With the Luxury and Degradation series Koons {{interfered}} {{into the}} realms of the social. He created an artificial and gleaming surface which represented a proletarian luxury. It was interpreted as seduction by simulation because it was faked luxury.

25|$|After his release, {{his sister}} gave some details about his {{detention}} condition to the press, {{explaining that he}} was subjected <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> psychological torture: he was detained in a tiny room with constant light, and two guards were set very close to him at all times, and watched him constantly. In November, Chinese authorities were again investigating Ai and his associates, this time under the charge of spreading pornography.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century {{and into the}} Mexican Revolution, the {{production}} of coffee was particularly important but labor-intensive. This {{would lead to a}} practice called enganche (hook), where recruiter would lure workers with advanced pay and other incentives such as alcohol and then trap them with debts for travel and other items to be worked off. This practice would lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> indentured servitude and uprisings in areas of the state, although they never led to large rebel armies as in other parts of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Neo Destour regime {{sought to}} run a {{strictly}} structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not with democratic-style politics. In effect, Bourguiba dominated {{the country for the}} next 31 years. He governed with programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state that was buoyant, touched with élan, even Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity. Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point energy (ZPE) {{or ground}} state energy {{is the lowest}} {{possible}} energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of the vacuum has these properties. According to Quantum Field Theory the universe {{can be thought of}} not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy. These fluctuating zero-point fields lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> reintroduction of an aether in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot {{be thought of as a}} physical medium if it is to be Lorentz invariant such that there is no contradiction with Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E
500|$|Cameron gave fellow {{directors}} Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson {{a chance}} to test the new technology.

[...] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.|$|E
500|$|Reality is an {{important}} theme in all of García Márquez's works. He said of his early works (with the exception of Leaf Storm), [...] "Nobody Writes to the Colonel, In Evil Hour, and Big Mama's Funeral all reflect the reality of life in Colombia and this theme determines the rational structure of the books. I don't regret having written them, but they belong <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> premeditated literature that offers too static and exclusive a vision of reality." ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{at least}} 13,000 {{theories}} on why he got the ax, some of them lurid, but none as obvious {{as the fact that}} CBS was starting to slip in the Nielsens. [...] "And there was a basic dissatisfaction with me," [...] as he put it. If Aubrey understood ratings and revenue, he also was no stranger <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> after-hours recklessness that mirrored the Camelot of its day. Nobody questions that Jungle Jim had a good time in the playgrounds of Manhattan and Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Richardson was {{not known}} for his {{political}} views. He reportedly voted for Winston Churchill's Conservative party in 1945, {{but there is little}} other mention of party politics in the biographies. Having been a devoted Roman Catholic as a boy, he became disillusioned with religion as a young man, but drifted back to faith: [...] "I came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> feeling I could touch a live wire through prayer". [...] He retained his early love of painting, and listed it and tennis in his Who's Who entry as his recreations.|$|E
500|$|One of Payton's {{signature}} maneuvers was the [...] "stutter-step", a high-stepping, irregularly paced run. He {{developed this}} {{as a way to}} distract his pursuers during long runs, saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners. In his autobiography, he likened the stutter step <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "option play": when he was stutter-stepping, defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether they thought he would accelerate after the stutter-step, or cut — he would read this angle and do the opposite of what the defender had committed to.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Rommel's {{victories}} in France were {{featured in the}} German press and in the February 1941 film Sieg im Westen (Victory in the West), in which he personally helped direct a segment reenacting the crossing of the Somme River. Rommel's {{victories in}} 1941 were played up by Nazi propaganda, even though his successes in North Africa were achieved in Germany's least strategically important theatre of World War II. In November 1941, Joseph Goebbels (head of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda) wrote about his intention to have Rommel [...] "elevated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> popular hero". Rommel, with his innate abilities as a military commander and love of the spotlight, was a perfect fit for the role Goebbels designed for him.|$|E
500|$|Help! {{publisher}} Jim Warren {{received a}} letter on 6 December 1961 accusing the magazine of copyright infringement and demanding removal of the offending issue from newsstands. [...] Warren's lawyer believed they could succeed if they fought the suit, but the legal costs {{would make it a}} [...] "Pyrrhic victory", and thus recommended settling out of court. [...] Warren could not have the magazine recalled, but he agreed to pay Archie Comics $1000 and ran a note of apology in a subsequent issue of Help!—the August 1962 issue, in which appeared another character franchise parody, [...] "Goodman Meets S*perm*n". Warren's action disappointed Kurtzman, who felt that giving in to such censorship set a [...] "terrible precedent", and amounted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> prostitution.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of midi-chloriansmicroscopic organisms that mediate {{use of the}} Forcein the film has been controversial among fans. Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality, although the film still portrays the Force as a mysterious entity using the midi-chlorians to communicate with living beings. Film historian Daniel Dinello says [...] "Anathema to Star Wars fanatics who thought they reduced the Force <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy." [...] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes [...] "In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled...The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'." ...|$|E
500|$|The Passion of Christ {{became a}} central concern {{during the early}} {{development}} of Bacon's work, and {{he returned to the}} subject throughout his career. When asked by critic Jean Clair why his Crucifixion scenes tended to comprise mainly [...] "slaughter, butchery, mutilated meat and flesh", Bacon replied, [...] "that's all the Crucifixion was, isn't it?... Actually, you can't think of anything more barbaric than the Crucifixion, and that particular way of killing somebody." [...] While Three Studies may have begun as an attempt to directly represent the Crucifixion scene, his explorations led him towards [...] "something completely different". Bacon came to regard the scene as an armature for exploring new ways of representing human behaviours and emotions. For him it amounted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> self-portraiture; a vehicle for working on [...] "all sorts of very private feelings about behaviour and about the way life is".|$|E
500|$|By 1970, the Who {{were widely}} {{considered}} one of the best and most popular live rock bands; Chris Charlesworth described their concerts as [...] "leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about". They decided a live album would help demonstrate how different the sound at their gigs was to Tommy, and set about listening to the hours of recordings they had accumulated. Townshend baulked at the prospect of doing so, and demanded that all the tapes be burned. Instead, they booked two shows, one in Leeds on 14 February, and one in Hull the following day, with the intention of recording a live album. Technical problems from the Hull gig resulted in the Leeds gig being used, which became Live at Leeds. The album is viewed by several critics including The Independent, The Telegraph and the BBC, {{as one of the best}} live rock albums of all time.|$|E
500|$|Craig Delancey, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York, {{cited the}} {{conclusion}} of [...] "Acrobat" [...] {{as an example of}} how rock music can be [...] "profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition." [...] He noted that [...] "the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless." [...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{abandoning the}} soundtrack album, Bowie went on tour {{in support of}} Station to Station, commencing 2 February 1976 and {{completing}} on 18 May 1976. Kraftwerk's [...] "Radioactivity" [...] was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from Luis Buñuel's and Salvador Dalí's surrealist film Un Chien Andalou. The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of Gitanes placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among [...] "curtains of white light", an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'. In 1989 Bowie reflected, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Expressionist German-film look... and the lighting of, say, Fritz Lang or Pabst. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I've ever done." [...] The Station to Station tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known bootlegs, culled from an FM radio broadcast of his 23 March 1976 concert at Nassau Coliseum. A live album was officially released years later.|$|E
500|$|Jorgensen {{calls the}} 1966 {{recording}} of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions," [...] as Presley had [...] "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement {{in which he}} took {{every part of the}} four-part vocal, from [...] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax," [...] in the process becoming [...] "a kind of one-man quartet." [...] Guralnick finds [...] "Stand By Me" [...] from the same sessions [...] "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance," [...] but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on [...] "Where No One Stands Alone" [...] on which [...] "he was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" [...] that Jake Hess would have no problem with. Hess himself thought that while others may have a voice as great or greater than Presley's, [...] "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime." [...] Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: [...] "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort." ...|$|E
500|$|The poem {{received}} a generally favourable critical reaction. Wagner {{called it a}} [...] "moving reversal of history", a [...] "fine poem", and [...] "the latest in a noble line of work [...] that aspires <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> salvation." [...] Heaven {{said that it was}} a [...] "poignant and beautiful tribute" [...] to Allingham. [...] It has been called [...] "sombre yet supremely uplifting". The poem was also noticed in the United States. Jenna Krajeski, a writer for The New Yorker, described it as [...] "another strong at-bat", and said that the poem highlighted [...] "the power, but also the shortcomings, of poetry" [...] when writing about an [...] "imaginary, impossible event" [...] and also writing about writing about it. The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a [...] "surprising success", adding that not only was it [...] "accessible" [...] and [...] "a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I," [...] but also [...] "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending." [...] However, Christopher Howse, a writer for the Daily Telegraph, took a different view of the poem's merits, saying (under the title [...] "Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham") that Duffy's verse form was [...] "open, to the point of invisibility".|$|E
2500|$|During WW2 in Vittorio d'Africa {{was done}} by the Italians the last battle against the British army before the Allied {{attacked}} Mogadiscio in 1941: because of this fight the small city suffered heavy damages. After the war all the Italians moved away and the farm production dwindled, reducing the city <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ghost town.|$|E
2500|$|The {{multiplicity}} of the decorations of the iconostasis {{serves as a}} reminder of the traditions of the golden age of Constantinople. They represent an attempt to draw together elements from all Constantinopolitan styles [...] "with a certain nostalgia". This leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Neo-Justinianism, but transformed into a characteristically Greek style through the technique of marble intarsia.|$|E
2500|$|Not all Jews use {{the term}} [...] "charoset". Some of the Jews of the Middle East instead {{use the term}} [...] "halegh". [...] The origin of halegh is not clear.

2500|$|The name [...] "domino" [...] is {{most likely}} from the {{resemblance}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> carnival costume worn during the Venetian Carnival, often consisting of a black-hooded robe and a white mask. Contrary to the coinage of the word polyomino as a generalization, there is no connection between the word [...] "domino" [...] and the number 2 in any language.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt told {{readers to}} not [...] "even bother" [...] with the novel, and that [...] "what {{goes on in}} these pages make Lenny Bruce seem angelic"; however, he {{acknowledged}} that the novel's true importance is in Thompson's literary method: [...] "The whole book boils down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mad, corrosive prose poetry that picks up where Norman Mailer's An American Dream left off and explores what Tom Wolfe left out".|$|E
