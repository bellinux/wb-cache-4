5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E

Finance charges incurred {{depend on the}} grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period {{if there is any}} outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.|$|E

The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018. Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> be used on the highway.|$|E

Begg stated that 'It is time to stop this cycle of uncontrolled rage and internecine violence <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> drive us to the pits of hell. Incessant calls for revenge each time need to be tempered with reflections on the consequences of what that means. There are no winners in this'.|$|E

25|$|Schneerson {{would finish}} almost every public talk of his {{with a prayer}} for the {{imminent}} arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought {{to raise awareness of}} the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the Holy Temple, laws <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner. Rabbi Schneerson would frequently quote the many sages who stated that this generation was the last generation of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would quote the Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.|$|E
500|$|There are {{potential}} applications for DNA nanotechnology in nanomedicine, {{making use of}} its ability to perform computation in a biocompatible format to make [...] "smart drugs" [...] for targeted drug delivery. [...] One such system being investigated uses a hollow DNA box containing proteins that induce apoptosis, or cell death, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> open when in proximity to a cancer cell. [...] There has additionally been interest in expressing these artificial structures in engineered living bacterial cells, most likely using the transcribed RNA for the assembly, although it is unknown whether these complex structures are able to efficiently fold or assemble in the cell's cytoplasm. [...] If successful, this could enable directed evolution of nucleic acid nanostructures.|$|E
500|$|As {{the novel}} continues, {{it becomes more}} and more caught up in digressions, such that the {{original}} narrative line is apparently forgotten. [...] The Supreme and his secretary discuss an often bizarre series of topics: a meteor that is apparently chained to Francia's desk; a prison camp in Tevego whose inhabitants have been turned to stone; and increasingly the dictator also ruminates on the past, particularly the events of Paraguay's foundation when he had to fend off the attention of Spaniards, Argentines, and Brazilians, all of whom threatened the nascent country's independence. [...] Chronology and logic are seemingly abandoned: at one point the dictator discusses the date of his own death; elsewhere he mentions events <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> happen long afterwards, such as the Chaco War of the 1930s (in which Roa Bastos himself fought).|$|E

Frog, [...] "The Frog Prince", and Kermit the Frog. The Warner Brothers cartoon One Froggy Evening features Michigan J. Frog, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> dance and sing for the demolition worker who opens his time capsule, but will not perform in public. [...] "The Frog Prince" [...] is a fairy tale about a frog that turns into a handsome prince after he has rescued a princess's golden ball and she has taken him into her palace. Kermit the Frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from The Muppet Show and Sesame Street; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant characters.|$|E

500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube {{will cause the}} airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E

2500|$|Flowers pollinated by {{bees and}} wasps vary in shape, colour and size. Yellow or blue plants are often visited, and flowers may have [...] ultra-violet nectar guides, {{that help the}} insect to find the nectary. Some flowers, like sage or pea, have lower lips <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> open when {{sufficiently}} heavy insects, such as bees, land on them. With the lip depressed, the anthers may bow down to deposit pollen on the insect's back. Other flowers, like tomato, may only liberate their pollen by buzz pollination, a technique in which a bumblebee will cling on to a flower while vibrating its flight muscles, and this dislodges the pollen. Because bees care for their brood, they need to collect more food than just to maintain themselves, and therefore are important pollinators.|$|E

In February 2011, Anderson narrated a short film about recent footage of an uncontacted tribe, in which the Amazon Indians were spotted from the air on the Brazil-Peru border.
