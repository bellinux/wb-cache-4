5|$|Eight {{years before}} her death, she had {{reportedly}} placed two-thirds of her money into trusts, {{for the benefit}} of her great-grandchildren. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth £70million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from Inheritance Tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, a <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> estimated at £28million (40 percent {{of the value of the}} estate) was not incurred. The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E

During his tenure, Delta Air Lines nearly doubled {{the number of people}} it employed at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Wilkinson secured Delta's expansion by agreeing to limit the company's sales <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> on jet fuel to $4 million annually. Additionally, Scott Paper Company opened a plant near Owensboro and North American Stainless, a Spanish-owned steel company, located a plant near Carrollton. During his term in office, Wilkinson served on the Education Commission of the States, the Southern Growth Policies Board, and the Council of the State Governments and the Southern States Energy Board. He was elected chair of the Southern Governors Association in 1990 and served on the Education Commission of the States' Policy and Priorities Committee.|$|E

40|$|The area-based {{property}} tax {{has been gaining}} influence in developing and transitional countries around the world. While an area-based {{property tax}} is advocated for its simplicity and transparency, it is often criticized as being unfair because assessed values upon which property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are based {{are not related to}} market values. We present a case study in Lithuania that explores the uniformity of assessments, and thus the implications for fairness of the distribution of property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> across properties, for an area-based tax as opposed to an ad�valorem property tax. The findings suggest that, in Lithuania, assessments are more uniform, and the distribution of property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> across properties are more fair, for detached housing under the area-based assessment than under the market-based assessment; alternatively, uniformity and fairness of the distribution of <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> for flats are better under market-based than area-based assessment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of deferred <b>tax</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> for a sample of large U. S. corporations between 1993 and 2004 and documents substantial heterogeneity in the deferred tax positions of different firms. In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net deferred <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred <b>tax</b> assets and <b>liabilities.</b> The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of deferred <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total deferred tax assets for sample firms with net deferred tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total deferred <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> for sample firms with net deferred <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of deferred tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement. We use data on the sales, market value, and assets of sample firms, relative to aggregate data for the U. S. corporate sector, to estimate the aggregate value of deferred <b>tax</b> assets and <b>liabilities...</b>|$|R

25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for {{tax on the}} full amount, but can set the withholding against his overall <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} tax payable, the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> of the recipient.|$|E
