5000|$|An {{effective}} approach shape can {{be derived}} from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. [...] Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach. One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another. Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row. It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the J approach to carry the body across the bar.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of Google Maps, a slew of {{developers}} have built systems which use information from other sources to produce composite maps showing the locations of various items.

Since the publication of the Google Maps API, even more applications built around this interesting framework have surfaced on the internet. All of these applications have several properties in common: they fetch their data from somewhere on the internet, they process it in some way (perhaps parsing it out of some human-readable format), they combine it with new formatting, and finally they display it on the map. In addition, since the Google Maps API deals only with raw coordinates, all these systems must perform “geocoding ” to convert the addresses into (latitude, longitude) pairs. All <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work even for seasoned programmers, and a fair amount of it is nearly identical for each such application.

30|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the aeronomy of Mars is very limited. The two Viking landers each carried a mass spectrometer [4] and a retarding potential analyzer [5]. Thus we have insitu neutral gas composition and plasma density, composition and temperature information from only the equivalent to a single sounding rocket flight. The other in-situ plasma composition data, comes from the ASPERA instrument [6] on Mars Express (MEX), which has been providing information on the density, composition and energy of ions and electrons of energies between about 10  eV to ~ 36  keV at altitudes beyond about 300  km. Much electron density data exists from the MARSIS instrument on MEX [7] from in situ and remote wave sounding - spottily from radio occultation observations obtained on early missions (e. g. Mariners, Viking, Russian “Mars” missions) and more comprehensively from the radio science limb occultation experiments on the more recent Mars Express [8] and Mars Global Surveyor [9] missions. The same Mars missions also provided some remote and inferred atmosphere information from UV occultation, from low altitude aerobreaking-phase satellite drag data (MRO, MGS, Odyssey) and more extensively from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), reflectometer measurements of atmosphere-scattered electron pitch angle distributions (e.g.,[10]). Finally the analogy between Mars and Venus, with similar atmosphere composition and regions with no intrinsic surface magnetic fields, has also provided important insights about the aeronomy of this poorly studied region of Mars. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> information, particularly of the electron density distributions. However, we have only glimpses of the overall complexity of the atmosphere and plasma states - there is, as of now, almost a complete absence of the thermal, composition and dynamical parameters that define the underlying physics of the Martian aeronomy.|$|E
40|$|With 1 rover, 2 astronauts and 3 days, the Apollo 17 Mission {{covered over}} 30 km, setup 10 {{scientific}} experiments and returned 110 kg of samples. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> science {{in a short}} time and the inspiration for a barebones, return-to-the-Moon strategy called Daylight Exploration. The Daylight Exploration approach poses an answer to the question, What could the Apollo crew have done with more time and today s robotics? In contrast to more ambitious and expensive strategies that create outposts then rely on pressurized rovers to drive to the science sites, Daylight Exploration is a low-overhead approach conceived to land near the scientific site, conduct Apollo-like exploration then leave before the sun goes down. A key motivation behind Daylight Exploration is cost reduction, but it does not {{come at the expense of}} scientific exploration. As a goal, Daylight Exploration provides access to the top 10 science sites by using the best capabilities of human and robotic exploration. Most science sites are within an equatorial band of 26 degrees latitude and on the Moon, at the equator, the day is 14 Earth days long; even more important, the lunar night is 14 days long. Human missions are constrained to 12 days because the energy storage systems required to operate during the lunar night adds mass, complexity and cost. In addition, short missions are beneficial because they require fewer consumables, do not require an airlock, reduce radiation exposure, minimize the dwell-time for the ascent and orbiting propulsion systems and allow a low-mass, campout accommodations. Key to Daylight Exploration is the use of piloted rovers used as tele-operated science platforms. Rovers are launched before or with the crew, and continue to operate between crew visits analyzing and collecting samples during the lunar dayligh...|$|E

40|$|Statistics and {{artificial}} intelligence {{have much in}} common. Both disciplines are concerned with planning, with combining evidence, and with making decisions. Neither is an empirical science. Each aspires to be a general science of practical reasoning. Yet the two disciplines have kept each other at arm's length. Sometimes they resemble competing religions. Each is quick to see the weaknesses in the other's practice and the absurdities in the other's dogmas. Each is slow {{to see that it}} can learn from the other. I believe that statistics and AI can and should learn from each other in spite of their differences. The real science of practical reasoning may lie in what is now the gap between them. I have discussed elsewhere how AI can learn from statistics (Shafer and Pearl, 1990). Here, since I am writing primarily for statisticians, I will emphasize how statistics can learn from AI. I will make my explanations sufficiently elementary, however, that they can be understood by readers who are not familiar with standard probability ideas, terminology, and notation. I begin by pointing out how other disciplines have learned from AI. Then I list some specific areas in which collaboration between statistics and AI may be fruitful. After these generalities, I turn to a topic of particular interest to me—what we can learn from AI about the meaning and limits of probability. I examine the probabilistic approach to combining evidence in expert systems, and I ask how this approach can be generalized to situations where we need to combine evidence but where the thorough-going use of numerical probabilities is impossible or inappropriate. I conclude that the most essential feature of probability in expert systems—the feature we should try to generalize—is factorization, not conditional independence. I show how factorization generalizes from probability to numerous other calculi for expert systems, and I discuss the implications of this for the philosophy of subjective probability judgment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> territory.

40|$|In eastern Africa Tithonia diversifolia, {{a common}} {{roadside}} weed {{with a beautiful}} yellow flower, may come into its own {{in one of the}} latest agroforestry systems being developed to improve soil fertility. The use of leguminous plants to increase soil fertility is not a new practice but the use of nonleguminous shrubs for this purpose is less common. In western Kenya, at the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) field station in Maseno, researchers have been studying the hedgerow potential of various species that grow around the farms in that area. This research has shown that two so-called hedgerow weeds, Tithonia diversifolia and Lantana camara, although not leguminous, have a relatively high percentage of nitrogen in their leaves and are ideal for mulching crops. Phosphorus is also found in surprisingly high quantities in the leaves of both shrubs. Most plant species in the same area contribute only 0. 01 % phosphorus, Lantana and Tithonia provide up to three times that quantity. Although not known for certain, it is thought that the roots of these plants may be associated with mycorrhizoral fungi, which form a symbiotic relationship with plants in a similar way to the root nodules in leguminous species. The fungal strands penetrate the roots in order to feed from the plants, but in return the fungus provides a greater surface area to absorb the minerals essential for the healthy growth of the host plant. Researchers began trials, first on the field station and then on farmers' fields, to find the optimum quantity of leaves that need to be applied as a mulch to the soil to achieve the optimum response. Five tonnes per/hectare of biomass was found to double, and occasionally even treble, the crop yields. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dry matter to cut and the labour can be costly, particularly with the more thorny Lantana which is more widespread than Tithonia. Tithonia is only found on a third of farms in the area and ICRAF suggests that the solution for farmers is to plant Tithonia in small woodlots on degraded areas of the farm, or to intercrop the tree in the field and so reduce some of the labour costs.
