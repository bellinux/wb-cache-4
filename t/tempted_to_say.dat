500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tree also pursued four Shakespeare film {{projects}} {{during his}} career at Her Majesty's. Of great historical interest is the filming, in 1899, of three brief segments from his production of King John, in which he starred and directed. [...] This is the first film record of a Shakespeare play. [...] Charles Urban filmed the opening shipwreck from the 1904 revival of The Tempest at the theatre in 1905; Tree, whose role in the production was Caliban, did not appear in this scene. Tree played Cardinal Wolsey in a 1911 studio film by William Barker of a five-scene version of Henry VIII, based on the theatre's 1910 production. Tree was paid the unprecedented sum of £1000 lest the film prove unsatisfactory, or damage ticket sales of the theatre presentation. [...] Filming took place at studios in Ealing, west London and took only one day, thanks to careful preparation beforehand. The film {{was presented to the}} public on 27 February 1911 in various theatres in London and in the provinces, and was a huge success. The Moving Picture World wrote, [...] "The picture is without doubt the greatest that has even been attempted in this country, and I am almost <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in any other ... the acting passes anything ever seen in moving pictures before.... The effect on the moving picture industry here will be enormous." [...] In California in 1916, Tree played the title role in a film of Macbeth, by D. W. Griffith (considered a lost film).|$|E

2500|$|Asquith's {{reputation}} {{will always}} be heavily influenced by his downfall {{at the height of}} the First World War. In 1930, Basil Liddell Hart summed up opinion as to the reasons for his fall; [...] "Lloyd George (came to) power as the spokesman for a widespread demand for a more vigorous as well as a more efficient prosecution of the war." [...] Asquith's collegiate approach; his tendency to [...] "wait and see;" [...] his stance as the chairman of the cabinet, rather than leader of a government—"content to preside without directing;" [...] his [...] "contempt for the press, regard(ing) journalists as ignorant, spiteful and unpatriotic;" [...] and his weakness for alcohol—"I had occasion to speak to the P.M. twice yesterday and on both occasions I was nearly gassed by the alcoholic fumes he discharged;" [...] all contributed to a prevailing sense that Asquith was unable to rise to [...] "the necessities of total warfare." [...] Grigg concludes, [...] "In certain vital respects, he was not qualified to run the war. A great head of government in peacetime, by the end of 1916 he was in a general state of decline, his obvious defects as a war leader (exposed)." [...] Cassar, reflecting on Asquith's work to bring a united country to war, and his efforts in the year thereafter, goes towards a reassessment; [...] "His achievements are sufficiently impressive to earn him a place as one of the outstanding figures of the Great War" [...] His contemporary opponent, Lord Birkenhead paid tribute to his bringing Britain united into the War, [...] ""A statesman who rendered great service to his country at a time when no other living Englishman could have done what he did." [...] The Coalition Whip, William Bridgeman, provided an alternative Tory view, comparing Lloyd George to Asquith at the time of the latter's fall; [...] "however unpopular or mistrusted (Lloyd George) was in the House, he carried much more weight in the Country than Asquith, who was almost everywhere looked on as a lazy and dilatory man." [...] Sheffield and Bourne provide a recent historical reassessment; [...] "Asquith's governments arguably took all the key decisions of the War: the decision to intervene, to send the BEF; to raise a mass volunteer army; to start and end the Gallipoli Campaign; the creation of a Coalition government; the mobilisation of industry; the introduction of conscription." [...] But the weight of opinion continues to agree with Asquith's own candid assessment, in a letter written in the midst of war in July 1916; [...] "I am (as usual) encompassed by a cloud of worries, anxieties, problems and the rest. 'The time is out of joint' and sometimes I am <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with Hamlet 'O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.' Perhaps I wasn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|Thought-terminating clichés, {{also known}} as thought-stoppers, are words or phrases that {{discourage}} critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short, generic truisms that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought. They are often sayings that have been embedded in a culture's folk wisdom and are <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> because they often sound true or good or like the right thing <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Some examples are: [...] "Stop thinking so much", [...] "here we go again", and [...] "what effect do my actions have?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Chapter {{three of}} Skinner's work, Verbal Behavior, {{discusses}} a functional relationship called the mand.
