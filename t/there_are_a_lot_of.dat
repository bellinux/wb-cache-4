5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that {{this is probably the}} longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> characters {{and most of them are}} older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|The {{border between}} {{mainland}} China and Hong Kong runs along Chung Ying Street. There {{is a perception}} of it being a notorious point of goods trafficking.

25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E
