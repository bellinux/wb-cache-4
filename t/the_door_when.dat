5|$|The {{court is}} {{composed}} of seven elected justices, each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be United States citizens, Oregon residents {{for at least three}} years, and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon. The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed “the broom closet”) and is responsible for opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>when</b> a conference is interrupted. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position. To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.|$|E

25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song.

This part of the video is {{from the point of view}} of the guy who is being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section of the video. This section begins with the guy knocking on the door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>when</b> she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez sitting in a chair singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E
500|$|The {{aliens in}} this episode who run past Scully in the mining {{facility}} were portrayed by children aged eight and nine. The spacecraft spotted by Mulder {{was achieved by}} using a crane to lift lights over the building Mulder was outside. Napier's constant {{is used as a}} code to access the mining facility in the episode, though the code used is in error. Scully and Mulder use the code [...] "27828" [...] to unlock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>when</b> in fact the first five digits of Napier's Constant are 27182. The mining facility is named for Dr. Hubertus Strughold, a real-life German scientist who was employed by the United States after World War II. The fictional Victor Klemper is based on Strughold, who was accused of conducting similar experiments on humans. Interestingly, the name is almost identical to a Victor Klemperer who was a German Jew that escaped persecution during World War II by fleeing to American-controlled territory. The Strughold Mining Facility was filmed at the B.C. Museum of Mining, in Britannia Beach, British Columbia, Canada. This episode was dedicated in memoriam to Mario Mark Kennedy, an internet fan of the show who had died in a car accident in 1995.|$|E

[...] After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to [...] "get back to [...] painting and painter's life", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war. [...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>when</b> Barney came to visit.

When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>when</b> I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it.

[...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him.
