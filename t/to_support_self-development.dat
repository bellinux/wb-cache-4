Through the usage of manga, both informational and emotional support for young people would be provided. This paper intended <b>to</b> create a <b>support</b> program that used manga for the self-development of youth. To this end, I discussed the following issues. First, through studies on the difficulties faced during a young man's self-development, I discussed the necessity of <b>supporting</b> the <b>self-development</b> of youth, and then developed an argument for supporting these youth. Second, I reviewed relevant research on self-development in recent studies related to manga, and then discussed the impact of manga on self-development. When both manga and the self are regarded as a narrative, we can regard the process of self-development as one of self-narrative development. Third, I examined the benefits and drawbacks {{of the use of}} manga in selfdevelopment, through analyses of cases, which then suggested that manga is highly suitable <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> the <b>self-development</b> of youth. Finally, I suggested a selfdevelopment support program that used manga, and then described its concrete procedure...|$|R

Efficient management of chronic diseases involves also lifestyle changes. With more effort on preventative health care and on supporting the behavior change towards healthier lifestyle, significant cost savings could be achieved. Psychological methods such as cognitive-behavioral therapies provide a foundation for understanding the change process and for developing ways <b>to</b> effectively <b>support</b> it. <b>Self-development</b> and change are processes, where people cyclically move between new behavior adoption, maintenance, relapse and re-adoption.

40|$|Human {{resources}} is becoming organization's most important assets for today, their quality {{plays an important}} role for the organization. Performance appraisal, hence, plays as an important tool to enhance employees quality. CIFOR is willing to develop a performance appraisal system {{that can be used to}} accommodate employees development needs. This thesis is intended to analyze staff perceptions on performance appraisal system applied, self-development, as well as staff perception on 360 -degree feedback. The data is analyzed using univariate and bivariate statistic, i. e. sign test and Spearman's coefficients of rank correlation. Staff indicated the current performance appraisal system needs to be revised. Staff agreed that the current performance appraisal has been closely related and <b>supported</b> <b>self-development,</b> and agreed that the application of 360 -degree feedback related to self-development. As a performance appraisal system revision will take time and needs efforts, it is suggested that staff is encouraged to submit monthly report, CIFOR conduct a supervisor training before the regular performance appraisal process take place and developed a developmental evaluation form. CIFOR also suggested to conduct a 360 -degree feedback pilot project. ...|$|R

40|$|This book is {{positive}} and carries {{a message of}} optimism for all members of a school community. It is about children, teachers, parents, their feelings, thoughts, desires, well-being and learning. From the very outset of the book the reader is taken fully on board and develops {{a clear understanding of}} the importance of Social-Emotional Education (SEE), as presented by the authors, in the twenty-first century. Educational research reports often end with recommendations for what ‘policy makers’ should do. Clearly linking research policy and practice is vital, but we often seem to over simplify the relationship between them. This book is a fascinating read because it supports educationalists engaged in teaching, planning and curriculum development. The educationists are informed of the social and emotional processes in education {{as well as in the}} formation of socially, emotionally and academically competent and resilient students. The book adopts a comprehensive whole school approach to the teaching of SEE, integrating it into the curriculum and teaching at an individual, classroom and school level. This sits well in our inclusive school climate. Innovatively this book includes SEE interventions with students experiencing difficulties together with an awareness of the emotional life and well-being of teachers and parents in their child’s education. The use of educational checklists enhances and <b>supports</b> <b>self-development</b> of the individual within a whole school community. peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{self-development}} plan provides {{commanders and}} other leaders with pointers to improve soldiers' and civilians' tactical and technical skills throughout their careers. The self-development plan follows each soldier from assignment to assignment and each civilian from position to position. Successful self-development requires a team effort between individual soldiers, civilians and their leaders. Self-development begins with a self-assessment of one's strengths, weaknesses, potential, and developmental needs. Commanders {{and other leaders}} create an environment that encourages subordinates to establish personal and professional development goals. Refinement of those goals occurs through personal coaching or mentoring by commanders and leaders. Reachback, dL, and other technologies <b>support</b> these <b>self-development</b> programs.|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} the disparities in social awareness {{and use of}} the Internet between urban and rural school children in the North of Vietnam. Approach A total of 525 pupils, aged 9 to 11 years old, randomly selected from 7 urban and rural schools, who are Internet users, participated in the study and consented to responding to a questionnaire adapted from an equivalent European Union (EU) study. A comparative statistical analysis of the responses was then carried out, using IBM SPSS v 21, which consisted of a descriptive analysis, an identification of personal self-development opportunities, as well as issues related to pupils’ digital prowess and knowledge of Internet use, and Internet safety, including parental engagement in their offspring’s online activities. Findings The study highlights the fact that children from both the urban and rural regions of the North of Vietnam mostly access the Internet from home, but with more children in the urbanized areas accessing it at school than their rural counterparts. Although children from the rural areas scored lower on all the Internet indicators, such as digital access and online personal experience and awareness, there was no disparity in awareness of Internet risks between the two sub-samples. It is noteworthy that there was no statistically significant gender difference towards online activities that <b>support</b> <b>self-development.</b> In relation <b>to</b> safe Internet usage, children are likely to seek advice from their parents, rather than through teachers or friends. However, they are not yet provided with an effective safety net while exposing themselves to the digital world. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and provide information on the factors that assist and hinder the success of outplacement counseling services. A company in Korea was selected for this study. This study reported on a phenomenological case study that applied two methods of data collection: semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 5 retirees and 3 outplacement experts and document analyses. The case study results indicated that many factors can affect and interact with one another for effective outplacement services are as follows: · individual characteristics(retrirement readiness, age, dignity, confidence, locus of control, etc.), · factors that affect reemployment or starting one's own business(a new job readingalignment among career goals, aptitude, new jobsexpertisenetworkmarketing and business skillsfamily supportjob networking infrastructure, etc.), · outplacement characteristics(communication strategies, outplacement readiness, customized services, organizational culture, the practicality of program contents, resistance from labor union, etc.) The improvement schemes found in this study were as follows: First, the outplacement program should be implemented as a part of human resource planning strategy based on a triple-win mindset of those related to the program such as the corporations, retirees, and consulting firms. Second, outplacement services make the necessary adjustments to ensure that retirees are effectively aligned with their career goals, needs, current competencies, and competencies required for new jobs. Third, retirees need to take a proactive job hunting efforts whiling maintaining the balance between work and life. Fourth, outplacement consultants should role as a total life career instead of a temporary career transition supporter in outplacment. Fifth, person-outplacement service-job matching infrastructure should be built. The outplacement srevice is not simply a retirement management activity, but a human resource planning strategy, a human resource development activity to provide the job competensies required in the labor market, and a lifelong learning in that it <b>supports</b> <b>self-development</b> and efforts for improving the quality of life. Therefore, the outplacement service should be operated as a core process of human resource system and will be even more effectively run when operated under the management philosophy of putting people first...|$|R

Originality/value: Although the Vietnamese national curriculum on the Computer Science subject does not explicitly cover the use of the Internet and its related aspects, the majority of children who took part in this study claimed to have used the Internet in their learning activities. This emphasises the urgent need for the MoE and educators in the country to not only improve ICT facilities in schools, but also to revise the Computer Science curriculum in order to (a) provide a supportive environment for learning development and (b) collectively advocate the dynamics of Internet use in order to ensure safe access and use by the children...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to, from a caring science perspective, uncover the meaning content in <b>to</b> <b>support</b> as well as it’s pragmatic {{features}} in healthcare leadership, with a focus on nurses’ health. The overall aim is <b>to</b> understand <b>to</b> <b>support</b> as a praxis concept in caring science. The study questions are: What does <b>to</b> <b>support</b> mean in the light of etymology and semantics? What shape has supporting in healthcare leadership with a focus on nurses’ health? The study belongs to the caring tradition and has a hermeneutic approach, where the interest of knowledge lies on understanding. The understanding deepens and the horizon broadens in the hermeneutic process where the preunderstanding goes in dialogue, with dictionaries in an etymological and a semantic analysis, and with peer reviewed articles in a contextual determination of the concept via content analysis. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> as a praxis concept in caring science integrates the concept <b>to</b> <b>support</b> and the supporting way of living. The study result in the following theses: <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> give cause for her to strive for becoming in health. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> place fundaments on which she can securely lean against or rest on. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ not <b>to</b> let her fall. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> confirm her unique dignity. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ genuine presence, where love embraces and unburdens. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> act beneficially so she can reach her potential. In healthcare leadership supporting takes the shape of supporting in the meaning of helping, assisting, promoting and subsiding, in the meaning of promoting, favoring and encouraging {{as well as in the}} meaning of establishing. That manifests concrete in that the healthcare leader is present, guides, respects, maintains ethical fundaments, inspire development as well as is equally flexible in creating outer conditions where the nurses’ inner can flourish...|$|R
