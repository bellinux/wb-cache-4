30|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} salinity and temperature on uptake of PFCAs by wheat. Our results showed both salinity and temperature were capable of inducing the increase of PFCA uptake and translocation in wheat grown in a hydroponic culture system. The TF values of four PFCAs were enhanced by 1.7 – 4.9 times as initial salinity increased from 0 to 0.4  % and growth temperature increased from 20 to 30  °C. These findings indicate the changes in salinity and temperature {{should be taken into}} consideration to assess exposure risks of PFCAs to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism</b> including human. In addition, given that a competing hydrophobic interaction caused by organic carbon in soil may reduce the transfer rate of PFAS to roots, it is very necessary to further investigate the uptake of PFCAs by plant in more environmentally relevant systems, e.g. by using natural organic matter.|$|E

40|$|Mycosporine-like {{amino acids}} (MAAs) and scytonemin are UV-screening {{compounds}} that have presumably appeared {{early in the}} history of life and are widespread in cyanobacteria. Natural colonies of the UV-insensitive Nostoc flagelliforme were found to be especially rich in MAAs (32. 1 mg g DW- 1), concentrated in the glycan sheath together with scytonemin. MAAs are present in the form of oligosaccharide-linked molecules. Photosystem II activity, measured using PAM fluorescence and oxygen evolution, was used as a most sensitive physiological parameter to analyse the effectiveness of UV-protection. Laboratory experiments were performed under controlled conditions with a simulated solar radiation specifically deprived of UV-wavebands with cut-off filters (295, 305, 320, 345 and 395 nm). The UV-insensitivity of N. flagelliforme was found to cover the whole UV-A (315 – 400 nm) and UV-B (280 – 320 nm) range and is almost certainly due to the complementary UV-absorption of MAAs and scytonemin. The experimental approach used is proposed to be suitable for the comparison of the UV-protection ability in organisms that differ in their complement of UV-sunscreen compounds. Furthermore, this study performed with a genuinely <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism</b> points to the relevance of marine photoprotective compounds for life on Earth, especially for the colonization of terrestrial environments...|$|E
40|$|Nonylphenols (NPs) are the {{breakdown}} {{products of the}} nonionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates and are toxic pollutants. Here we studied the bioaccumulation, elimination, and biotransformation of NP (12. 3 mg kg(- 1) soil dry weight) in a typical Chinese geophagous earthworm, Metaphire guillelmi, in a rice paddy soil, using 4 -[1 -ethyl- 1, 3 -dimethylpentyl]phenol (4 -NP(111)), the main constitute of technical NP, radiolabeled with (14) C. Earthworms rapidly bioaccumulated (14) C- 4 -NP(111) following a two-compartment first-order kinetics model. At steady state (after 20 days exposure), the normalized biota-soil accumulation factor amounted to 120, and 77 % of the accumulated radioactivity were present as nonextractable bound residues. The total radioactivity was eliminated from the earthworm following an availability-adjusted decay model and controlled by the elimination rate of the bound residues (half-life = 22. 6 days). The extractable residues consisted mainly of one less-polar metabolite (37 %) and polar compounds (50 %), including glucuronide conjugates of 4 -NP(111) and the metabolite; and free 4 -NP(111) accounted for only 9 % of the total extractable residues. This study provides the first results of the toxicokinetics and biotransformation of 4 -NP in a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism,</b> and underlines the significant underestimation of the bioaccumulation and risk assessment based only on free NP in earthworms...|$|E

40|$|Otolith {{microchemistry}} and {{isotopic analyses}} {{have emerged as}} effective techniques for providing insights into fish environmental history {{that are difficult to}} obtain by other means. Stable hydrogen isotope ratio (2 H/ 1 H or D/H, expressed as δD) is a possible environmental marker that has not been employed in fish provenance research, although it has been applied as a natural tracer of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism</b> migrations. We illustrate the potential of δD to serve as a new natural marker of fish environmental history by demonstrating that significant linear relationships (r 2 ≥ 0. 97) exist between fish otolith and muscle δD and δD of waters that fish inhabit. Differences between mean water δD and both muscle and otolith δD were not significantly correlated with fish total length and were not significantly different among species, indicating that water–fish δD relationships are consistent across fish sizes and species. High r 2 values for regressions of otolith and muscle δD on water δD for fishes inhabiting locations with diverse thermal regimes suggest that relationships between water and fish δD are not strongly affected by water temperature. Demonstration that fish δD clearly reflects water δD provides a foundation for future research to reconstruct fish movement among locations with distinct δD signatures...|$|E
40|$|Venus and Earth {{are similar}} in terms of size and bulk composition, yet their surface {{conditions}} are radically different. Earth has hosted plate tectonics and a global magnetic field for billions of years, sustaining water oceans and allowing life to flourish. A thick atmosphere chiefly composed of carbon dioxide, in contrast, drives a greenhouse effect on Venus that would instantly reduce any <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism</b> to ash. In this thesis, I present several contributions to the debate raging over whether Venus and Earth resembled {{each other in the}} past or if unique circumstances placed these celestial siblings on divergent paths from the start. First, I introduce a new process—precipitation of magnesium-rich minerals—that explains the apparent longevity of Earth's dynamo given plausible assumptions about how the core and mantle lose heat. This mechanism relies on high-temperature equilibration in the aftermath of giant impacts, meaning that Earth's violent birth enabled its clement present. The lack of a magnetic field thus indicates that Venus escaped savage bombardment or simply that sluggish mantle convection insulates the core. My analyses of the size and spatial distributions of impact craters suggest that volcanism proceeds planet-wide at gradual rates rather than as catastrophic resurfacing events, which supports a uniformitarian view of Venus. Modeling of enigmatic features called coronae on Venus also sheds light on the properties of the crust and lithosphere that yield a stagnant lid rather than plate tectonics. Finally, I present a thermal history for Venus that is consistent with these and other available constraints. Various uncertainties in my models highlight the pressing need to gather more data relevant to Earth's deep interior and from the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide risk {{assessments}} include experiments {{designed to measure}} the effect of pesticides on earthworms using the [i]Eisenia fetida fetida[/i] or [i]Eisenia fetida andrei[/i] species. There is no clear consensus {{in the literature on}} the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. We performed a meta-analysis on the sensitivity of several earthworm species to pesticides to determine the most sensitive species, and to discuss their suitability for European homologation tests. A dataset including median lethal dose (LC 50) values reported in 44 experimental treatments was constructed and then analyzed in order to compare the sensitivity levels of [i]E[/i]. [i]fetida[/i] with that of other earthworm species. Results showed that LC 50 values reported for [i]Lumbricus terrestris[/i] and [i]Aporrectodea caliginosa[/i] were on average significantly lower than for [i]E[/i]. [i]fetida[/i]. Considering the relatively high LC 50 values reported for [i]E[/i]. [i]fetida[/i] and the absence of this species from zones where pesticides are usually applied, the relevance of using [i]E[/i]. [i]fetida[/i] for pesticide homologation tests is questionable and we advise risk assessors to use [i]A[/i]. [i]caliginosa[/i] as model species. A new protocol based on this species could be proposed for European homologation tests but its implementation will require the definition of a new standard and take time. In the meantime, the results obtained with [i]E[/i]. [i]fetida[/i] should be interpreted with caution taking into account the low sensitivity of this species. Our study illustrates the value of the meta-analysis approach for comparing the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. It would be useful to extend the dataset presented in this paper in order to analyze the sensitivity of other aquatic or <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organism</b> groups used for pesticide homologation or ecotoxicology tests...|$|E
