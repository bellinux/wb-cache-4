25|$|In {{any given}} triangle, the {{circumcenter}} is always collinear with the centroid and orthocenter. The line that passes {{through all of}} them is known as <b>the</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{line segment}} joining a vertex of a {{tetrahedron}} with the centroid {{of the opposite}} face is called a median and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a bimedian of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all concurrent at a point called the centroid of the tetrahedron. In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the centroid (see Commandino's theorem). The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define <b>the</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>line</b> of the tetrahedron that is analogous to <b>the</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>line</b> of a triangle.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also lies on <b>the</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>line.</b> Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of}} the way from the Monge point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E

40|$|We {{define and}} study {{a variant of}} the center of mass of a polygon and, more generally, of a simplicial polytope which we call the Circumcenter of Mass (CCM). The Circumcenter of Mass is an affine {{combination}} of the circumcenters of the simplices in a triangulation of a polytope, weighted by their volumes. For an inscribed polytope, CCM coincides with the circumcenter. Our motivation comes from the study of completely integrable discrete dynamical systems, where the CCM is an invariant of the discrete bicycle (Darboux) transformation and of recuttings of polygons. We show that the CCM satisfies an analog of Archimedes' Lemma, a familiar property of the center of mass. We define and study a generalized <b>Euler</b> <b>line</b> associated to any simplicial polytope, extending <b>the</b> previously studied <b>Euler</b> <b>line</b> associated to <b>the</b> quadrilateral.
