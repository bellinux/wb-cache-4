5|$|Christian and Muslim {{philosophers}} modified Ptolemy's {{system to}} include an unmoved outermost region, the empyrean heaven, which came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, 617 Patroclus was {{the first}} Jupiter trojan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a binary asteroid. The binary's orbit is {{extremely}} close, at 650km, compared to 35,000km for the primary's Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan—624 Hektor— is probably a contact binary with a moonlet.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar {{at each end of}} the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash {{at each end of the}} arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{considered}} Ornatotholus a juvenile S. validum, therefore a junior synonym. In 2000, Robert M. Sullivan referred S. edmontonensis and S. brevis to the genus Prenocephale (until then only {{known from the}} Mongolian species P. prenes), and found {{it more likely that}} S. bexelli belonged to Prenocephale than to Stegoceras, but considered it a nomen dubium (dubious name, without distinguishing characters) due to its incompleteness, and noted its holotype specimen appeared to be lost. In 2003, Thomas E. Williamson and Thomas Carr considered Ornatotholus a nomen dubium, or perhaps a juvenile Stegoceras. In a 2003 revision of Stegoceras, Sullivan agreed that Ornatotholus was a junior synonym of Stegoceras, moved S. lambei to the new genus Colepiocephale, and S. sternbergi to Hanssuesia. He stated that the genus Stegoceras had become a wastebasket taxon for small to medium-sized North American pachycephalosaurs until that point. By this time, dozens of specimens had been referred to S. validum, including many domes too incomplete <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Stegoceras with certainty. UALVP 2 is still the most complete specimen of Stegoceras, upon which most scientific understanding of the genus is based.|$|E

Richard Owen had discovered Cetiosaurus in 1841 but had incorrectly identified it as a gigantic sea-going crocodile-like reptile. Mantell identified Pelorosaurus as a dinosaur, living on land.|$|E

40|$|Antigenic {{changes during}} the {{intracellular}} transformation of Leishmania mexicana subsp. amazonensis from promastigotes to amastigotes in macrophages of J 774 G 8 line were noted mostly among protein bands of 24 to 68 kilodaltons in apparent molecular weight. In this region, six <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> common antigens of both stages, six <b>to</b> seven <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> promastigote specific, and three <b>to</b> five <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> amastigote specific. At the higher-molecular-weight region (greater than 68 kilodalton) were two bands, one being predominant in amastigotes {{and the other}} in promastigotes. There may be a transformation-specific band (apparent molecular weight = 20 kilodaltons). The transition of these stage-specific antigens varies considerably with different protein species and may play important roles in intracellular leishmanial differentiation...|$|R

25|$|The Great Depression did not {{strongly}} affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was {{the first}} to implement what have come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{identifying}} victims and survivors, some Rwandans are left <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> perpetrators. This becomes increasingly problematic as all Hutus are deemed perpetrators—where their {{survival of the}} genocide seems to imply some form of complicity with the former government. Thus, in this process of rebuilding and bringing guilty parties to justice, the current government is providing dangling linkages back to the very ethnicities they wish to abolish and is risking further entrenching supposed “past” ethnic divisions.|$|E

The Congress won only 44 seats, which was its worst-ever performance in a national election and brought into question whether it would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> an officially recognised party.|$|E
