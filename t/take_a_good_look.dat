5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Juanes {{released}} his solo debut Fíjate Bien (<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Look),</b> produced by Gustavo Santaolalla. The album fared well in Colombia, spending ten weeks {{at the number}} one position, but was unsuccessful in other countries. The album earned him three Latin Grammys for Best New Artist, Best Rock Solo Vocal Album, and Best Rock Song, and Juanes performed at the award show. Later that night, Juanes brought demos for over forty new songs to Santaolalla's studio, ready to begin work on another album.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} marketed with several taglines, including: [...] "We've always {{believed}} we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were", [...] "Earth. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look.</b> It {{could be your}} last", and [...] "Don't make plans for August". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third {{of which was a}} spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as [...] "truly brilliant".|$|E
60|$|Jules Varlin {{held the}} lantern above his head, and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at his visitors.|$|R
60|$|The {{policeman}} questioned Jerry closely, {{and then}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> {{around for the}} individual. Later on, boy and officer walked to Mrs. Price's boarding-house.|$|R
60|$|From the elevation, all <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> {{at every}} part of the island that could be seen. They saw several other rocky {{elevations}} and the entrances to caves innumerable.|$|R
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the Navy. [...] Soldiers have to tramp miles, {{sleep in}} the mud, eat cold rations, and live for days in wet clothes. Sailors have warm bunks, eat hot meals, and wear dry socks every day.|$|E
60|$|She did not {{recognize}} me, but I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at her as I went by, longing {{to know what the}} particular secret was that ended in such a gale of laughter.|$|R
60|$|As before, {{the youth}} swung {{to the next}} tree, and again the bear gave a growl and went down. Then, being {{near the top of}} the tree, the lad <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> around.|$|R
60|$|Without a reply--save a grin--Arkal turned, and, {{jumping into}} the bushes, was {{immediately}} out of sight. His comrade, before starting off {{to carry out his}} part of the programme, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the scout whom he was bound to circumvent.|$|R
2500|$|... "So {{we need to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at {{the word}} 'Multiculturalism'. Although this word seems to sound so good, in reality it is {{currently}} destroying the Judeo-Christian West {{and replacing it with}} an 'Interfaith' deceptive agenda led by the United Nations. It is Communism wearing a new uniform. It is also worth noting that the first few letters of this word is [...] "Multicult"-uralism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, I {{look forward}} to a day in the near future. The day when policy makers, academicians, journalists and other opinion leaders all over the world <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the things we are doing so well together. And they will say: these two used to be worlds apart. But they now have a fair dinkum of a partnership. Why can’t we all do likewise? ...|$|E
2500|$|In early April 2006, Harris {{told the}} Tampa Tribune {{that some of}} her ex-campaign staffers and the {{national}} Republican party were deliberately sabotaging her campaign by [...] "putting knives in her back" [...] and had warned {{her that if she}} did not back out of the campaign, she would get an [...] "April surprise". Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said [...] "They were all good professionals...There was no backstabbing. It's insulting that she would even say that. If she wants to know what went wrong with the campaign, maybe she needs to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> in the mirror." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{scarcely}} had {{the children}} <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at this delightful creature, when the Wax Doll leaped lightly from the carriage and stood before them, showing, {{as she did}} so, that her feet were clad in white satin slippers, embroidered with silver.|$|R
60|$|Honora <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at {{the famous}} Trixy, who resembled {{a certain type}} of {{military}} Englishman. He had close-cropped hair and a close-cropped mustache; and his grey eyes, as they rested amusedly on Mrs. Chandos, seemed to have in them the light of mockery.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{librarian}} {{opened his}} book and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> {{at the number of}} the page on which paradoxes were treated, so that he might remember it; then he rose and put the book upon the table, and, turning to Abner, he looked at him steadfastly.|$|R
2500|$|The {{access road}} {{required}} some deep cuts {{to keep it}} level at the intersection with Drury Lane. Bill Gorton, NYSDOT's regional design engineer, compared it to the initial construction of I-84. [...] "We tell our young engineers to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at what we're doing here because chances are they won't see anything like this again in their careers", said Rashid Shariff, DOT's engineer in charge. Over [...] of dirt were moved. A quarter of {{that was used to}} fill a ravine the road crosses; the rest will be used as needed on the airport property.|$|E
2500|$|June 30, 1940 – The Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Vincas Kreve-Mickevicius, {{meets with}} Molotov. Molotov is blunt in {{communicating}} the Soviet intent {{to occupy the}} entire region: [...] "You must <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at reality and understand {{that in the future}} small nations will have to disappear. Your Lithuania along with the other Baltic nations, including Finland, will have to join the glorious family of the Soviet Union. Therefore you should begin now to initiate your people into the Soviet system, which in the future shall reign everywhere, throughout all Europe; put into practice earlier in some places, as in the Baltic nations, later in others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not likely," [...] ses the conjurer. [...] "Now, {{everybody}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at this watch, {{so as to}} {{make sure}} there’s no deceiving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, {{after she}} had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, 'I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light from}} the big window fell right on the picture. I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at it. Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look. Then I went back to where I had been at first, because it hadn't seemed quite so bad from there.|$|R

6000|$|... "You <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at him," [...] {{urged her}} brother, [...] "and don't forget that it's {{four years since}} you saw him. Isn't that Bert's nose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it pretty? Just {{the soft}} effect {{that is so}} {{becoming}} to your dear, pale face. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at it, and tell me whether you'll have pale pink bows or lavender." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will make}} a note of that, anyhow, Davis, and I will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the next {{alligator}} I see dead, so as to know exactly where to feel for its eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me see father,' Michael begged eagerly, and he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look.</b> 'He {{is not so}} big as {{the pirate}} I killed,' he said with such frank {{disappointment}} that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; {{it would have been}} sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.|$|R
6000|$|... '"What?" [...] says Toby, [...] "I {{thought it}} was Gert Schwankfelder." [...] He put down his fiddle and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at me. [...] "Himmel!" [...] he says. [...] "I have hit the wrong boy. It is not the new boy. Why are you not the new boy? Why are you not Gert Schwankfelder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{set that}} nearest island by compass, Daggett?" [...] asked Roswell Gardiner, {{as soon as}} he had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> around him. [...] "To me it seems that it bears more to the eastward than it did an hour since. If this should be true, our inner field here must have a very {{considerable}} westerly set." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look,</b> {{and tell}} me what you think of it," [...] said Dr. Alec, opening the door and letting her enter before him, while Phebe was seen whisking down the backstairs with a dust-pan.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, no,' cried Sam. 'Sit {{here and}} finish your dinner. He's comin' right back, and I'll collect the toll.' Half-way to the toll-house Sam met Abner. 'What {{do you think}} of her?' he asked hurriedly. 'Did you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Look a' here,' he said; 'you hurry out to {{the gate}} and take a good long look at the girl that's there. She's a-visitin' in the neighborhood. Now mind you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at her, and I'll {{be there in a}} minute.' ...|$|E
6000|$|...

6000|$|... 'Pretty well {{to shave}} by, eh?' says Maine to his mother-in-law. (He was getting more abominably {{conceited}} every minute.) 'Get away, Sackville,' says she, quite delighted, {{and threw a}} glance over her shoulder, and spread out {{the wings of the}} red tabinet, and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at herself; so did Mrs. Sackville--just one, and I thought the glass reflected a very smiling, pretty creature.|$|R
60|$|The {{man stood}} {{blinking}} {{at us with}} the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at us all, and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.|$|R
