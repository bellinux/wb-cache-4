40|$|The {{boom of the}} {{internet}} economy and the smartphone explosion currently experienced in South Africa is making it increasingly more convenient for South African residents to purchase electronically supplied goods and services from suppliers located all across the globe with the mere click of a button. The increasing number of purchases online is making it almost impossible for the South African Revenue Service to collect the Value-Added Tax on specifically electronically supplied services purchased from foreign suppliers. It is further placing South African suppliers of similar goods and services in a disadvantaged position in respect of pricing when compared to foreign suppliers. In the 2013 budget speech, the Minister of Finance indicated that the Value-Added Tax implications of the supply of digitised products by foreign suppliers are an area of concern. By July 2013 proposals were contained in the Draft <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill</b> to address this very problem. The {{aim of this study}} is to critically evaluate the proposed methods to collect Value-Added Tax on electronically supplied services, as contained in the Draft <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill</b> through a detailed literature review and critical evaluation. The literature review focuses on sections 7 (1) (c) and 14 of the Value-Added Tax Act, the sections of the Value-Added Tax Act which currently regulates the collection of Value-Added Tax on electronically supplied services, as well as the methods used in the European Union and New Zealand to collect Value-Added Tax and Goods and Services Tax on electronically supplied services. The critical evaluation of the proposals identifies shortcomings and provides recommendations to overcome the shortcomings to ensure that the proposed changes will address the concerns and align South African legislation with global practices. The study concludes that, although the proposed changes to the method to collect Value-Added Tax on electronically supplied services are a step in the right direction, there is still work to be done by legislators on the details of the proposals to ensure successful implementation in a South African environment.

5000|$|Comments by supporters: The {{proposed}} {{amendment would}} remedy inconsistency in the taxation of personal motor vehicles {{also used for}} the production of income and allows the will of the legislature in enacting House Bill No. 809 in 2005 to have its desired effect. Because the motor vehicles affected by the proposed amendment were exempted from rendition for <b>taxation</b> by House <b>Bill</b> No. 809, most of those vehicles go untaxed. Current law allows an appraiser to harass a property owner by taxing motor vehicles that are exempt from rendition. It is clear that the legislature exempted these vehicles from rendition with the intent to exempt them from taxation. By limiting this exemption to one motor vehicle per individual owner, the proposed amendment allays concerns that a fleet of motor vehicles could be exempted from taxation by a person who uses each vehicle for personal use for a short time each year.|$|R

The amendments of the transfer pricing legislation were introduced by SARS in the Explanatory Memorandum on the <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill</b> 2010, which came into effect from 1 October 2011. The amended Section 31 of the Income Tax Act seeks to capture both direct and indirect transactions for transfer pricing purposes, thereby substantially widening the scope and implication of the Section.

40|$|Background: Trusts {{have long}} been used as an estate {{planning}} mechanism, including the avoidance of estate duty and donations tax. In the 2016 National Budget the Minister of Finance indicated that Government was proposing several legislative measures during 2016 / 2017 to prevent individuals from using a trust to avoid estate duty (and donations tax to a certain extent). Unexpectedly, the 2016 draft <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill</b> and the final Amendment Bill did not give effect {{to any of these}} proposals, but introduced other less drastic measures to control the abuse of trusts for tax purposes, albeit with the same stated purpose. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} clarify the reform proposals (albeit unclear and consequently based on certain assumptions) and to compare the reform proposals with the final amendments. This comparison will shed some light on the fairness and appropriateness of the final amendments and, more importantly, on the possibility that the reform proposals published by National Treasury in February 2016 not included in the final amendments will be enacted in the future. This investigation will assist tax practitioners and taxpayers in effective tax and estate planning, given that the reform proposals and final amendments have a possible impact on the future of discretionary trusts in South Africa. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Methods: In order to meet this objective a qualitative approach based on a literature study of pure theoretical aspects was used. Results and conclusion: It was found that should the reform proposals become law, many trusts would become ineffective from a tax-planning perspective and these changes might erode other benefits trusts offer, jeopardising the future of discretionary trusts in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The sale of {{an entity}} as a going concern {{has a number}} of tax {{consequences}} for both the purchaser and the seller. The tax deductibility of a contingent liability upon its transfer from the seller to the purchaser, where the selling price has been reduced by the value of the contingent liabilities transferred, remains uncertain following the decision in Ackermans Ltd v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. An expense is either deductible under a specific section of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, or under the general expense provisions in terms of sections 11 (a) and 23 (g). The Act does not contain a specific section relating to contingent liabilities and therefore a contingent liability will need to be considered for deduction under these sections. The Act further disallows an expense as a deduction under section 23 (e), where a reserve is created (for example a leave pay provision). This study analyses the tax deductibility of a contingent liability, where the contingent liability has been transferred from the seller to the purchaser in a sale of an entity as a going concern and the purchase price has been reduced to compensate for the transfer of the contingent liability. The deductibility of the contingent liability was first assessed in terms of the provisions of the Act (sections 11 (a), 23 (g) and 23 (e)) and associated case law. The decision in the Ackermans case and its preceding Income Tax Case 1839 was then analysed in order to establish the principles arising from the decisions. Finally the proposals in the Draft <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill,</b> 2011, and the subsequent Discussion Document issued by the South African Revenue Service were discussed.

40|$|The South African {{government}} announced in 2008 that {{it intends to}} promote South Africa as a suitable company headquarter jurisdiction for investment in Africa {{in general and the}} sub-Sahara region in particular. The 2010 <b>Taxation</b> Laws Amendment <b>Bill</b> introduced a number of tax changes to lure headquarter companies to South Africa. The new South African headquarter company regime attempts to attract foreign direct investment through these changes. The government plans to make South Africa a gateway for African investments. In order to achieve this goal the regulatory, economic and legal frameworks need to be suitable for international investment. This study analyses the tax characteristics of an ideal holding company regime and investigate the importance that is placed on tax considerations compared to non-tax considerations by companies when faced with investment decision making and whether tax is a primary driver of such decisions. A single source ethnographic case study is used to analyse the process followed by an organisation, and the considerations used by the key decision makers within this organisation, for setting up a holding company in South Africa to drive an investment and business expansion. The case study consists of an investigation into the process followed, the strategy formulated and the structuring of the business for making the investment in selected African countries. It further investigates where the ultimate holding company will be located as a headquarter company for all further Africa business expansion. It was found that the tax considerations are mainly a favourable capital gains tax regime, low income taxes, no or low tax on dividends, a favourable tax treaty network, the absence of controlled foreign company legislation and a liberal thin capitalisation and transfer pricing regime. Non-tax factors also {{play a significant role in}} decision making when considering the investment destination. These factors include: economic and political stability; adequate physical, business, accounting and legal infrastructure; the absence (or limited presence) of bureaucratic obstacles; adequate communication channels; the ability to repatriate profits freely; an effective banking system; and the availability of an adequate dispute resolution mechanism. There is a definite distinction between tax specific strategies where enterprises are set up to take advantage of tax incentives provided by certain jurisdictions and where an investment decision is taken and aligned with business decisions to align these strategies to take advantage of a favourable tax regime Jurisdictions that only concentrate on tax incentives will find it difficult to attract foreign direct investment. Decision makers that are held responsible for investors’ capital will take tax as well as non-tax aspects into account when deciding to invest in a country and to set up holding company in that jurisdictions. It is therefore important for a jurisdiction to provide an environment that is conducive to do business in order to attract foreign direct investment.
