As Table  2 shows, their bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> achieved strong growth. The second is <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> which originate in high-income countries and are destined to low-income countries (N–S). The third is <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> whose origins are in developing countries and are exported to the developed world (S–N); their trade in primary products was based on previous stages and grew very slowly in the study period. The final category is <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> between low-income economies (S–S), whose growth of exchanges accelerated in the final fifteen years of the last century.|$|R

Controlling for the fixed effects generally reduces the estimated trade impacts of regional agreements. The estimates reveal that regional agreements have significant anticipatory effects on <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> and continue to affect trade for up to 11 Â years after they begin.

Furthermore, the two factors show an interaction effect, where increasing trade openness diminishes the influence of bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> on asset holdings.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the emergence}} of current account imbalances {{as a result of}} the co-existence of <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> and financial flows.

Second, we test a reduced form of the model for 28 OECD countries for the period 1971 - 2014.
