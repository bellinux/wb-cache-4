5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, I {{believe in}} {{collaborating with the}} {{employer}}s! That is what unions are for. I even believe in helping an employer function more productively. For <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have a claim to higher wages, shorter hours, and greater participation in the benefits of running a smooth industrial machine....|$|E

25|$|Since {{there is}} a pin joint at A, it will have 2 {{reaction}} forces. One in the x direction {{and the other in}} the y direction. At point B, we have a roller joint and hence we only have 1 reaction force in the y direction. Let us assume these forces to be in their respective positive directions (if they are not in the positive directions like we have assumed, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> get a negative value for them).|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden commented in {{response}} to [...] "World of Stone" [...] and other songs that [...] "again plead plaintively with critics not to judge too severely": [...] "In this different context , such pleas are more sympathetic. Very well, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not." [...] In a 2001 review for Record Collector, Peter Doggett said that Extra Texture merited reappraisal and that [...] "In retrospect, side one of the album was most commendable, from the upbeat 'You' … to the portentous 'World Of Stone'." ...|$|E
500|$|Dalglish {{was pleased}} with Liverpool's game and told the press: [...] "The most {{important}} thing is that we got our own standard of football right. We were the better team in all departments and we know that if we get it right <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E

500|$|The video also faced a ban from MTV Arabia {{citing the}} same reason as Australia. Since it was very rare to ban videos on MTV, head of MTV Arabia Samer al Marzouki commented, [...] "We {{represent}} the young generation's mentality and culture so we can't play something that conflicts with that. If they can't watch something comfortably with their brother, sisters or friends <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not play it." [...] In the United States, VH1 and MTV played an edited version that removed the scenes showing Gaga naked, and blurred the label on a bottle of alcohol held by a dancer, {{but they did not}} change the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In the 1977 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler {{described}} Extra Texture as [...] "another lugubrious offering" [...] and concluded: [...] "the needle of the listener's personal Ecstatograph points sullenly towards zero throughout." [...] Harrison's pleas for tolerance and understanding, like his self-deprecation {{on the album}} sleeve, seemed to backfire. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden found that the album showed signs that Harrison was [...] "no longer so scornful of his audience" [...] compared with Dark Horse. Woffinden wrote of the songs that [...] "plead plaintively with critics not to judge too severely": [...] "In this different context, such pleas are more sympathetic. Very well, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not. Extra Texture wasn't really very good musically... but it did have some appealing qualities, and barely any disagreeable ones." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still under}} the gag order, in an {{interview}} with the Marathi weekly magazine Lok Prabha of the Indian Express group, Raj was quoted as saying: [...] "We will go with folded hands and ask them [...] to leave. If they refuse, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> raise our hands." [...] Lok Prabha editor Pravin Tokekar said: [...] "The MNS chief has technically not made any inflammatory statement. Even when he says he and his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

500|$|FT-74 {{informed}} the NAS that aircraft were lost, then advised Taylor {{to put the}} sun on his port wing and fly north up the coast to Fort Lauderdale. Base operations then asked if the flight leader's aircraft was equipped with a standard YG (IFF transmitter), {{which could be used}} to triangulate the flight's position, but the message was not acknowledged by FT-28. (Later he would indicate that his transmitter was activated.) Instead, at 16:45, FT-28 radioed: [...] "We are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico." [...] During this time no bearings could be made on the flight, and IFF could not be picked up. Taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 kHz. This order was not acknowledged so he was asked to switch to 3000kHz, the search and rescue frequency. Taylor replied – [...] "I cannot switch frequencies. I must keep my planes intact." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, Khánh phoned Taylor {{from his}} office and {{expressed}} his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Khánh then asked his colleagues {{to participate in a}} campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khắc Sửu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyễn Khánh {{and put an end to}} all this. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is {{what it comes down to}} in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> all have made a mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E
500|$|The deposal {{prompted}} US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in {{a private}} meeting and threaten to cut off aid {{if they did not}} reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khac Suu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see what happens." [...] However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khánh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon. Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi [...] "is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner. His only real objective is to continue the game." [...] Time described him as [...] "vain, ambitious, an inveterate intriguer". The New York Times described him as [...] "a coup specialist".|$|E
5000|$|He, however did reply, [...] "But if all {{you want}} is to come to fight, we have the graves of our fathers. Come on, find these and try to destroy them: you shall know <b>then</b> whether <b>we</b> <b>will</b> fight you." ...|$|R

2500|$|Turkey's Jews, on {{the other}} hand, {{themselves}} a vulnerable minority population, reacted with some discomfort at Metzger putting them in an awkward situation.
