5|$|McGann {{was cast}} as Walter Golic to appear with Ralph Brown, his co-star in Withnail and I. Alien 3 Assembly Cut expands on Golic's part in Alien 3, with Golic persuading Morse <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> {{him in the}} {{infirmary}} when he hears that the Alien has been trapped. He knocks Morse out, goes to the containment chamber containing the Alien, kills Arthur (who is guarding the door) and releases the creature—which promptly kills him. In an August 1992 Elle magazine article, McGann said that Golic intends to release the Alien {{in the hope that}} he can collaborate with it to kill the humans on Fury 161. Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who fall under the influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advance in}} dinghy sailing was {{introduced}} in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced, doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the 'hounds' or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also be very dangerous if the crew is not wearing a quick release harness or is inexperienced. The quick release harness allows the crew <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize.|$|E
2500|$|... 10 December 2004: Captain Miles Selby {{died in a}} midair {{collision}} {{during training}} near Mossbank, Saskatchewan while practising the co-loop manoeuvre. The other pilot, Captain Chuck Mallett, was thrown from his destroyed aircraft while still strapped into his seat. While tumbling towards the ground, he was able <b>to</b> <b>unstrap,</b> deploy his parachute and land with only minor injuries.|$|E
60|$|He {{flung the}} pack from off his {{shoulders}} {{as he spoke}} and fell <b>to</b> <b>unstrapping</b> it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with curiosity) peered down {{at him through the}} grated iron bars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{had your}} hoss hobbled {{out among the}} {{chickweed}} and clover in the green pasture back o' the mill, and he's picked up that much that he's lookin' fat and sassy," [...] he said quietly, beginning <b>to</b> mechanically <b>unstrap</b> Key's bridle, even while his guest was {{in the act of}} dismounting. [...] "His back's quite healed up." ...|$|R
60|$|What mattered {{that his}} single arm could not lift the {{treasure}} he had found! What mattered that to unfix those glittering stars would still tax both skill and patience! The work was done, {{the goal was}} reached! even his boyish impatience was content with that. He rose slowly <b>to</b> his feet, <b>unstrapped</b> his long-handled shovel from his back, secured it in the crevice, and quietly regained the summit.|$|R
2500|$|The {{helicopter}} crew lowered {{a line to}} survivors to tow them to shore. First {{to receive}} the line was Bert Hamilton, who was treading water about ten feet from the plane's floating tail. The pilot pulled him across the ice to shore while avoiding {{the sides of the}} bridge. By then some fire/rescue personnel had arrived to join the military personnel and civilians who pulled Hamilton (and the next/last three survivors) from the water's edge up to waiting ambulances. The helicopter returned to the aircraft's tail, and this time Arland D. Williams Jr. (sometimes referred to as [...] "the sixth passenger") caught the line. Williams, not able <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> himself from the wreckage, passed the line to flight attendant Kelly Duncan, who was towed to shore. On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter lowered two lifelines, fearing that the remaining survivors had only a few minutes before succumbing to hypothermia. Williams, still strapped into the wreckage, passed one line to Joe Stiley, who was holding on to a panic-stricken and blinded (from jet fuel) Priscilla Tirado, who had lost her husband and baby. Stiley's co-worker, Nikki Felch, took the second line. As the helicopter pulled the three through the water and blocks of ice toward shore, both Tirado and Felch lost their grip and fell back into the water.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON. How {{is a man}} to {{remember}} anything when he is trussed up in this ridiculous fashion? I can hardly breathe. [He makes a futile struggle to free himself.] Here: don't be unkind, your Majesty: tell these fellows <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> me. You know you really owe me an apology.|$|E
60|$|So {{he looked}} about till {{he found his}} trunk, and, leading Jennie there, he took his station {{by the side of}} it, and {{immediately}} proceeded <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> and unlock it. He took out some of the largest things {{from the top of the}} trunk and put them on a settee near, so that the officer could easily examine the rest. By the time he had done this, an officer was ready.|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one course open to him now, {{and that was to}} cut his way out with his hatchet. Before {{beginning}} <b>to</b> act he <b>unstrapped</b> his bundle and sat down to eat, having previously relieved Attim of his load and given him some food. Everything he did had to be done by feeling, for he could not see his hand even when held only an inch from his face.|$|R
60|$|Foster Portney and Captain Zoss {{had been}} {{fortunate}} enough to secure passage up to Dyea, on a little steamboat, which was to leave early the next day. The craft was a freight boat, but carried passengers whenever she could get them. No time was lost in transferring their goods to this craft, Fred Dobson helping them carry their loads. Doctor Barwaithe had also secured passage in the craft, and soon {{became one of the}} party. Later on, matters were talked over by him and the others, and it was agreed that the five should stick together until the Klondike region was reached. The forming of little parties of five or more was popular among those who travelled by the overland route into Alaska. By such means there was less danger of a man getting lost in the mountains, and the preparation of meals along the way was easier, for each man of a party took his turn at feeding the rest, so that only one set of packs had <b>to</b> be <b>unstrapped</b> and packed again, instead of the lot. Besides this, the building and sailing of a boat down the lakes and through the rapids by one man was next to impossible.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{back upon}} that moment afterwards, {{he remembered that}} he was not dazed, dazzled, or startled. It did not come to him as a {{discovery}} or an accident, a stroke of chance or a caprice of fortune. He saw it all in that supreme moment; Nature had worked out their poor deduction. What their feeble engines had essayed spasmodically and helplessly against the curtain of soil that hid the treasure, the elements had achieved with mightier but more patient forces. The slow sapping of the winter rains had loosened the soil from the auriferous rock, even while the swollen stream was carrying their impotent and shattered engines to the sea. What mattered that his single arm could not lift the treasure he had found; what mattered that to unfix those glittering stars would still tax both skill and patience! The work was done, the goal was reached! even his boyish impatience was content with that. He rose slowly <b>to</b> his feet, <b>unstrapped</b> his long-handled shovel from his back, secured it in the crevice, and quietly regained the summit.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was one {{brilliant}} move, at any rate," [...] said Beth to herself, as {{she laid}} aside her hat and prepared <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> her small trunk. [...] "I've made {{a friend at}} Elmhurst who will be of use to me; and I shall make more before long. Come {{as soon as you}} like, Cousin Louise! You'll have to be more clever than I am, if you hope to win Elmhurst." ...|$|E
60|$|Attracted by {{the call}} from Fred and the loud whistle given by Andy, the old lumberman had noted {{that a number of}} {{visitors}} were {{standing in front of the}} two cabins at the upper end of Snowshoe Island. He was still a considerable distance out on the lake, but his rapid skate strokes soon brought him to the shore. Then, without waiting <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> his skates, he came forward through the snow, his shotgun ready for use.|$|E
60|$|He had his {{knapsack}} {{before him}} on the table, and he smiled rather grimly as he began <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> it. Paynter looked on with polite expressions of interest, but was considerably surprised when the artist unpacked and placed on the table, not any recognizable works of art, even of the most Cubist description, but (first) a quire of foolscap closely written with notes in black and red ink, and (second), to the American's extreme amazement, the old woodman's ax with the linen wrapper, which he had himself found in the well long ago.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Cough is {{a common}} and {{troublesome}} symptom in cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) but the mechanisms responsible are not known. The cough threshold to inhaled capsaicin is increased in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) where lung volumes are increased, but the relationship between cough response and symptom intensity has not been studied in CFA where lung volumes are reduced.  METHODS—Capsaicin challenge tests were performed on 15 subjects with proven CFA and 96 healthy controls. Symptoms, as assessed by daily diary card cough score and by visual analogue scale (VAS), were related to the capsaicin sensitivity (C 5) and compared with lung volumes. Volume restriction was produced in a group of 12 normal healthy subjects by a plastic shell tightly strapped to the chest wall. Capsaicin challenge tests were performed in these subjects, both strapped and <b>unstrapped,</b> <b>to</b> determine whether volume restriction altered the cough reflex.  RESULTS—The median C 5 response in normal subjects was more than 500 µM compared with 15. 6 µM in those with CFA (p< 0. 001). The C 5 response of the CFA patients was not related to symptoms of cough (whether measured by diary card or by VAS), nor was it related to percentage predicted total lung capacity (TLC) or forced vital capacity (FVC). Volume restriction of normal subjects with chest strapping successfully restricted lung volumes to levels {{similar to that of the}} CFA patients but did not change the sensitivity to capsaicin.  CONCLUSIONS—The cough reflex measured using capsaicin is markedly increased in patients with CFA. This increase is not the result of alterations in the deposition of inhaled particles of capsaicin brought about by volume restriction. It could be related to reduced lung compliance leading to sensitisation of rapidly adapting receptors, other mechanical changes, or to destruction of pulmonary C fibres secondary to interstitial inflammation. The capsaicin test may be a useful method of objectively monitoring cough propensity in CFA. ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{bent down}} and began <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> {{something}} from his bicycle. It was something that had puzzled his companion {{all the way in}} spite of what held him to more interesting riddles; it appeared to be several lengths of pole strapped together and wrapped up in paper. Fisher took it under his arm and began to pick his way across the turf. The ground was growing more tumbled and irregular and he was walking toward a mass of thickets and small woods; night grew darker every moment. [...] "We must not talk any more," [...] said Fisher. [...] "I shall whisper to you when you are to halt. Don't try to follow me then, for it will only spoil the show; one man can barely crawl safely to the spot, and two would certainly be caught." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gould, {{raising her}} eyes to her husband's thin, red and tan face, could not detect the {{slightest}} quiver of a feature at what he must have heard said of his patriotism. Perhaps he had just dismounted on his return from the mine; he was English enough to disregard the hottest hours of the day. Basilio, in a livery of white linen and a red sash, had squatted for a moment behind his heels <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> the heavy, blunt spurs in the patio; and then the Senor Administrator would go up the staircase into the gallery. Rows of plants in pots, ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters of the arches, screened the corredor with their leaves and flowers from the quadrangle below, whose paved space is the true hearthstone of a South American house, where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting {{of light and shadow}} on the flagstones.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to paint the general disappointment at this sudden collapse of the experiment. A united groan burst from the party, including the patient, for it at once became apparent that a man with a wooden leg--to say nothing of two--could only walk on a hard beaten path, and as there were few such in the island, Rosco's chance of a long ramble seemed to vanish. But Zeppa and his son were not men to be easily beaten. They set to work to construct feet for the legs, which should be broad enough to support their friend on softish ground, and these were so arranged with a sort of ball-and-socket joint, that the feet could be moved up and down. In theory this worked admirably; in practice it failed, for after a staggering step or two, the toes having been once raised refused to go down, and thus was produced the curious effect of a man stumping about on his heels! To overcome this difficulty the heels of the feet were made to project almost as much behind as the toes did in front somewhat after the pattern of Ebony's pedal arrangements, as Rosco remarked when they were being fitted on for another trial. At last, by dint of perseverance, the wooden legs were perfected, and Rosco re-acquired the art of walking to such perfection, that he was to be seen, almost at all times and in all weathers, stumping about the village, his chief difficulty being that when he chanced to fall, which he often did, he was obliged either to get some one to help him up, or to crawl home; for, being unable to get his knees to the ground when the legs were on, he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> them if no one was within hail.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1863, the 3rd {{was engaged}} in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On {{the last day of}} fighting, somewhere in the deep woods, Major Maffett and several other members of the 3rd were {{captured}} by members of the 122nd Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvanians tried to convince Maffett to surrender his sword peacefully, but the major refused to do so except to an officer of similar rank. Private Henry Nixdorf pointed a rifle at Maffett and said, [...] "Are you going <b>to</b> <b>unstrap</b> that sword, or rather take the consequences of being run through with this bayonet?" [...] Maffett reluctantly surrendered his pearl-handled dress sword. Maffett soon escaped his captors in the confusion of battle and what happened to his sword is unrecorded.|$|E
