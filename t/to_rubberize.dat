40|$|Abstract. According to mixture {{proportions}} design, rubber concrete specimens were produced, {{which were}} used for test of resistance to frost. In this study, different grain size and different content rubber were mixed in Portland cement concrete. Quick freeze-thaw test was carried <b>to</b> <b>rubberized</b> concrete. The research shows that appropriate proportional fine aggregate replaced by the discarded tires powder and grain can improve concrete resistance to frost, although concrete compressive strength, flexural strength and dynamic elasticity modulus decrease with increasing of rubber content. The improving effect of rubber powder is better than rubber grain. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the dynamic elasticity modulus obtained by Non-destructive testing can commendably evaluate the frost resistance of rubberized concrete...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{disposal}} of used tires {{is a major}} environmental problem throughout the world which causes environmental hazards. Crumb rubber is a waste material that is ideal for use in concrete applications. The {{aim of this study}} is achieved to use of rubber waste as partial replacement of fine aggregate <b>to</b> produce <b>rubberize</b> concrete in M 30 mix. Different partial replacements of crumb rubber (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 %) by volume of fine aggregate are cast and test for compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength and stress-strain behavior. The results showed that there is a reduction in all type of strength for crumb rubber mixture, but slump values increase as the crumb rubber content increase from 0 % to 20 %. Meaning that crumb rubber mixture is more workable compare to normal concrete and also it is useful in making light weight concrete.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the dynamic modulus, rutting resistance, moisture susceptibility and fatigue resistance of rubberized Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) through laboratory performance tests. Rubberized SMA mixes were produced by three processes: the dry process, the wet process and the terminal in the laboratory. For comparison purposes, SMA mixtures containing styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) modified binder and virgin asphalt of PG 67 - 22 were also evaluated and compared <b>to</b> <b>rubberized</b> SMA. Dynamic modulus and direct tension fatigue tests were performed using the Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester (AMPT) system. Rutting resistance and moisture susceptibility were analyzed by Hamburg wheel tracking test using asphalt pavement analyzer (APA). The results showed that: (1) the incorporation of CRM improved the high temperature dynamic modulus, the resistance to rutting and fatigue life of SMA mixes. (2) The introduction processes of CRM (dry process and wet process) may have effect on the high temperature dynamic modulus and rutting resistance, while no significant influence on the moisture susceptibility and fatigue life. (3) The use of combination of SBS and CRM in the terminal SMA significantly improved the resistance to rutting and fatigue cracking. (4) The rubberized SMA with 10 % CRM had the lower performance properties than SBS SMA, regardless of the dry process or the wet process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In general, the binder in asphalt rubber {{mixtures}} is stiffer {{than that}} in a conventional binder; therefore, {{the need for a}} higher compaction temperature. The compaction temperature for conventional mixes in the laboratory is defined as the range of temperatures where the unaged asphalt binder has a kinematic viscosity of 280 ± 30 mm 2 /s. With respect <b>to</b> <b>rubberized</b> mixes, the compaction temperature should be determined carefully because the viscosity affects the compactability of the mixes. This study was initiated to investigate the effect of compaction temperature on several rubber-modified mixes. For this, four Superpave mix designs (9. 5 mm) for four asphalt binders (control, 10 % and 15 % rubber modified, and 3 % SBS-modified binders) were conducted to determine optimum asphalt contents (OAC). A total of 160 specimens were fabricated using Superpave gyratory compactor at four compaction temperatures (116, 135, 154, and 173 °C). The binders were short-term aged for 2 hours at the mixture compaction temperatures using rolling thin film oven (RTFO) prior to the binder tests. Evaluation of the mixtures and the binders included the following testing procedures: Volumetric properties (as-compacted, horizontally cut, and vertically cut specimens), rotational viscometer, and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The results from this study showed that the compaction temperatures used in this study significantly affected the volumetric properties of the rubberized mixtures, unlike conventional mixtures with virgin and SBS-modified binders...|$|R
40|$|Six Asian {{elephants}} at the Oregon Zoo {{were observed}} {{to determine the}} effects of a poured rubber flooring substrate on captive Asian elephant behavior. Room utilization also was evaluated in seven rooms used for indoor housing, including Front and Back observation areas. Data were collected in three phases. Phase I (Baseline Phase) examined elephant behavior on old concrete floors. In Phase II (Choice Phase), elephant behavior was observed in the Back observation area where room sizes were comparable and when a choice of flooring substrates was available. Phase III (Final Phase) examined elephant behavior when all rooms in both observation areas, Front and Back, were converted <b>to</b> <b>rubberized</b> flooring. Room use in both observation areas remained stable throughout the study, suggesting that flooring substrate did not affect room use choice. However, there was a clear pattern of decreased discomfort behaviors on the new rubber flooring. Normal locomotion as well as stereotypic locomotion increased on the new rubber flooring. In addition, resting behavior changed to more closely reflect the resting behavior of wild elephants, which typically sleep standing up, and spend very little time in lateral recumbence. Overall, these findings suggest that the rubber flooring may have provided a more comfortable surface for locomotion as well as standing resting behavior. It is suggested that poured rubber flooring may be a beneficial addition to similar animal facilities. Zoo Biol 26 : 51 – 61, 2007...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve salt {{corrosion}} and frost resistance of cement-soil, the waste tire rubber powder was mixed into cement-soil <b>to</b> form <b>rubberized</b> cement-soil. In the salt corrosion and freeze-thaw cycle (SCFT) conditions, compressive strength of rubberized cement-soil increases first and then decreases with rubber content increasing. The more numbers of SCFT cycles, the more strength slip increases. But in high concentration conditions, the strength of rubberized cement-soil with 5 %- 10 % rubber content reduces. With the solution concentration or SCFT cycles number increasing, peak stress of rubberized cement-soil and common cement-soil gradually reduces, but strength slip of rubberized cement-soil is lower than of cement-soil. Studies indicate that the performance of rubberized cement-soil surpasses common cement-soil decided by the relationship between rubberized cement-soil skeleton elastic behavior and coupling expansive force...|$|R

A series of tests including compressive strength tests, flexural strength tests, elastic modulus tests and ultimate strain ratio tests were done respectively. The results of tests showed that the value of the compressive strength, flexural strength and elastic modulus decreased with the increase of the mixing amount of rubber, while the decrease amplitude was different from each other. The value of ultimate strain increased a little and the ability of toughness and deformation of rubberized concrete were enhanced obviously through dipping rubber particles into NaOH solution. ...|$|R

40|$|Waste tire rubber is a {{promising}} lightweight aggregate for building products that enhances their thermal and acoustic properties. Even {{the environmental benefits}} of its use are evident, higher cost and significant changes in compressive strength and workability hinder its widespread adoption. This article examines the use of crumb rubber (CR) as aggregate in dry-mix mortars <b>to</b> produce <b>rubberized</b> long hollow blocks and bricks using automated brick machines. CR was incorporated over a range of 10 - 40 % with water/ cement ratio varying from 0. 7 to 0. 9. The production of rubberized bricks exhibited better performance than long hollow blocks in factory trials. Tests showed important deformations and drastic reduction in compressive strength, especially for crumb rubber percentages greater than 20 %.

The analysis covers the construction of the road bituminous layer, base and subbase, including production of materials and components, energy consumption, materials transportation and maintenance of the road. The disposal of the road is not included within the analyzed system. The assessment shows that, in both cases (conventional and rubberized asphalt layer), the main contribution to the environmental impacts is due to bitumen production and fuel consumption in the top asphalt layer construction. However, although the addition of end-of-life tires crumb rubber to the bitumen in the road construction yields increased burdens on some impact categories, rubberized asphalt shows overall reduced environmental impacts with respect to conventional asphalt, mainly due to its better performance over time...|$|R

The connections between chemistry, rheology and mechanical properties of bituminous material are discussed in this thesis. A patent technology holding by LCMT team has been applied and improved to control the swelling during the dry process of producing rubberized bituminous material. The Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FT-IR) and other technology has been adopted to characterize {{the effects of the}} modified patent technology. The experimental results indicated that new chemical functional groups have been generated by the improved treatment. SEM graphs of waste rubber particles before and after the treatment demonstrated that the morphological characteristics of rubber powder are apparently different. Other respective tests also confirmed the treatment's positive effects. This modified treatment has been confirmed to be {{a significant improvement}} of the stability and other relevant properties of the rubberized bituminous material, and its economical & green prospects make it a competitive rubber applying process for real construction works.

Three types of extractor drums namely; square head bolted, rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} <b>to</b> develop <b>rubberized</b> concrete with achievable structural strength using simple mix design. Simple mix design is a description by using the crumb rubber, used as in condition just received from the plant without any washing or pre-treating procedure. Then, three types of durability test were conducted namely, 1) Chloride ion diffusion test, 2) Abrasion wear resistance test, and 3) Freezing and thawing test. Up-to-date, many successful achievements were reported by researchers around the world. However, in Asian cases, very rare information on the use of wasted as a mixture component is gathered. By conducting this study, it could provide useful and valuable knowledge for construction technology especially for Asian industry. This dissertation consists mainly of the seven chapters. In Chapter 1, the background, problem statement, significance, research contribution and novelty of this study are listed out. In Chapter 2, research review on previous researchers work on the application of waste tire rubber in mortar/concrete and durability are described. Several important properties related to this study were viewed and discussed. High reduction in strength properties was observed by previous researchers and many suggestions were proposed either by washing the rubber or the use of suitable treatment on the rubber surface in order to enhance the bonding of the matrix. However, in my research, by using conventional mixing method, it was proposed that to use the rubber without any treatment (use directly as received) with maximum 20 % sand replacement in volume is a method to use crumb rubber effectively. As a result, each rubberized mixture showed an acceptable structural strength value. In Chapter 3, three step-by-step stages of mix design were conducted and discussed. The first stage was the preliminary study to determine the suitable waste tire rubber size and percentage replacement {{that can be used in}} rubberized mortar. Three rubber size group were received from the industry plant which where combination of 1 mm- 3 mm, combination of 0. 71 mm- 1. 7 mm and 0. 425 mm. Size of 1 mm – 3 mm with 10 % of sand replacement was chosen in terms of acceptable fresh and hardened mortar properties. In second stage, suitable water-to-cement ratio (w/c) and required additional binder was determined before proceeding to concrete mix. Results shows that w/c = 0. 35 gave reliable mortar physical properties. Finally, rubberized concrete with w/c = 0. 35 was carried out and specimens were prepared for mechanical test and durability test. Along these three stages, air content was carefully studied and controlled. iv In Chapter 4, experimental work and discussion on chloride ion diffusion in rubberized concrete tested by migration test and by immersion in salt water was described. Effective diffusion coefficient, De test was conducted according to JSCE-G 571 - 2003. Meanwhile, immersion test in salt water was conducted according to JSCE-G 572 - 2003. Additional concrete specimen with w/c = 0. 50 was prepared to study the effectiveness of CR in high w/c in comparison with w/c = 0. 35. Results showed that chloride transport characteristics were improved by increasing the amount of CR due to the fact that CR has the ability to repel water. Meanwhile, rubberized concrete with w/c = 0. 35 gave better resistance against chloride ion compared to w/c = 0. 50. In Chapter 5, discussion on the effectiveness of crumb rubber to improve wear resistance tested by surface abrasion test was described. An experimental study on abrasion wear resistance was conducted on mortar (w/c = 0. 35, 0. 30 and 0. 25) and concrete (w/c = 0. 35) specimen containing CR with and without silica fume. From test results, it was clearly seen that 10 % crumb rubber addition as sand replacement provide good resistance against abrasion. Meanwhile, compressive strength was the most important factor affecting the abrasion resistance, where abrasion resistance was increased with an increase in compressive strength. However, abrasion resistance was found to be slightly decreased when compressive strength exceeds 50 N/mm 2. In Chapter 6, the role of crumb rubber as air void under freezing and thawing was studied. Specimen was prepared in three groups; first group was the specimen without silica fume with air content ranging between 4 % to 5 %, second group was the specimen without silica fume with air content ranging between 0 % to 1. 5 % and third group was the specimen with silica fume with air content ranging between 4 % to 5 %. These rubberized concrete were tested on freezing and thawing resistance to understand this behavior. The temperature for freezing and thawing was set to 15 oC ± 5 oC for thawing temperature and - 18 oC ± 5 oC for freezing. This test was continued until 300 cycles according to ASTM C 666. Results show that up to 300 freeze-thaw cycle, there was no minus effect observed for all specimen. In Chapter 7, conclusions are drawn based on Chapter 4 to Chapter 6 and recommendations for future works is presented...|$|R
