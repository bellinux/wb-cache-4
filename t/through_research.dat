5|$|Robinson and {{six other}} Georgia Tech {{researchers}} (including Robinson's former professor James E. Boyd and EES director Gerald Rosselot) each contributed $100 (for a total of $700) and founded Scientific Associates on October 31, 1951, with the initial goal of marketing antenna structures being developed by the radar branch of the EES to the U.S. military. Robinson worked as the unpaid general manager for the first year. The relations between Scientific Associates and the EES were initially strained due to an unrelated dispute over station finances between EES director Gerald Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. Specifically, Emerson believed that surplus funds realized <b>through</b> <b>research</b> contracts {{should be returned to}} Georgia Tech, while the Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Rosselot felt they should be retained to foster additional research.|$|E
