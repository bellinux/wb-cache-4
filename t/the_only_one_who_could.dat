5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a hit-and-run involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have committed the crime.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt he was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
25|$|Still {{the head}} of the liberals, Giolitti did not resist the country’s drift towards Fascism. In 1919 he {{supported}} the cabinet of Ivanoe Bonomi, a social-liberal who led the Reformist Socialist Party; when Bonomi resigned, the Liberals proposed again Giolitti as Prime Minister, considering him <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> save the country from the civil war. The People's Party of Don Luigi Sturzo, which was the senior party in the coalition, strongly opposed him. On 26 February 1922, King Victor Emmanuel III give Luigi Facta the task to form a new cabinet. Facta was a Liberal and close friend of Giolitti.|$|E

Puyi did not see his biological mother, Princess Consort Chun, {{for the next seven}} years. He developed a special bond with Wen-Chao Wang and credited her with being the only person who could control him. She was sent away when he was eight years old. After Puyi married, he would occasionally bring her to the Forbidden City, and later Manchukuo, to visit him. After his special government pardon in 1959, he visited her adopted son and only then learned of her personal sacrifices to be his nurse.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{between the}} end of 1149 and 1151, Agnes married with Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich of Pereyaslavl, eldest son of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. The Chronicler Wincenty Kadłubek, who knew the Piast-Rurikids affinities, {{explicitly}} described in his Chronica Poloniae that Agnes was given to Mstislav as wife. Further confirmation of this fact where: Mstislav's eldest son was called nephew of Casimir II the Just, and the relationship existing between Roman the Great and Leszek the White is described as cousins in the second degree. In addition, Roman is named jątrwią (wife's brother), of Leszek in the Hypatian Codex. Therefore, is Mstislav had to marry with any of Bolesław III's daughters, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> marry was Agnes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} sixteenth century, a twelve-year-old shepherdess called Anglèze de Sagazan {{received}} {{a vision of}} the Virgin Mary near the spring at Garaison (part of the commune of Monléon-Magnoac), somewhat further away. Anglèze's story is strikingly similar to that of Soubirous: she was a pious but illiterate and poorly educated girl, extremely impoverished, who spoke only in the local language, Gascon Occitan, but successfully convinced authorities that her vision was genuine and persuaded them to obey the instructions of her apparitions. Like Soubirous, she was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> see the apparition (others could apparently hear it); however, the apparition at Garaison's supernatural powers tended toward the miraculous provision of abundant food, rather than healing the sick and injured. Mid-nineteenth century commentators noted the parallels between the events at Massabielle and Garaison, and interestingly, interpreted the similarities as proof of the divine nature of Soubirous's claims. At the time of Soubirous, Garaison was a noted center of pilgrimage and Marian devotion.|$|E

Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Simpson {{prepared}} for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the [...] road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He {{got back to the}} peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia. Halfway through the race he was given the wrong musette (bag) by his team in the feed zone, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, Molteni's Gianni Motta attacked. Simpson was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained him for a while. On the final climb Simpson led Motta, but was exhausted. Over the remaining [...] of flat terrain, Motta dropped him; Simpson cracked, and was repeatedly overtaken, finishing twenty-first. He closed the year riding track races.|$|E

Until this point {{he may have been}} a voice of {{restraint}} amongst the court party– possibly even on the queen herself. But his political realignment with the queen that year was decisive enough that it ultimately [...] "hastened" [...] the outbreak of hostilities again, although he may have been partially motivated by financial needs, and encouraged to do so by those retainers reliant on him. He had a bigger retinue than almost any other noble in Englandand was probably <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> match York in power and income.

He, too, would be transformed, once he picked up the baton... and I must admit that Tristan und Isolde made an even bigger impression when De Sabata conducted it than with Toscanini. Toscanini was perfection: upright, even. De Sabata, on the other hand, pushed and pulled the music. Afterwards, when Toscanini had left, De Sabata was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> take his place.

[...] Gajasura replied: [...] "Who do you take me for? I can immediately give you whatever you ask." [...] The flutist then said: [...] "If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach." [...] Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet.

2500|$|On 12 June 2015, Head of Ninawa Operations Command General Najim al-Jubouri {{stated that}} the planned {{offensive}} for Mosul had begun, with Iraqi forces, along with Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces fighters, being deployed {{to the city of}} Baiji, on the road to Mosul. US-led Coalition warplanes were also reported to be pounding ISIL positions in Mosul. However, it was noted that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> officially declare the start of the battle was the Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, which he did not. In addition, two days earlier, The Daily Beast interviewed the general who said the date to begin the operation, [...] "may be very close but I can’t tell you when exactly". When pressed he said it would take place {{in less than a year}} and that more than 30,000 soldiers would take part, which some analysts found hard to believe since the Iraqi military was still decimated and rebuilding following the successful ISIL offensive of June 2014. The news agency described the general's plan to retake the city as [...] "fantasy". Another contributing factor to the delay of the offensive was the ISIL capture of Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar province, in May 2015. As of late June, Iraqi General al-Jubouri said that forces were still being marshaled for an assault on Mosul, while city residents were becoming increasingly disappointed at the constant delays of the offensive.|$|E
