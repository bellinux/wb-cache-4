5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Anbe Sivam commenced in July 2002. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> {{featuring the}} lead actors {{was shot at}} Pollachi Junction railway station. Kamal and Madhavan interacted closely during {{the initial stages of}} the shoot to ensure that the on-screen chemistry between the pair was apparent.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} but <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> of the Matsudaira scroll, this scene {{is set on}} the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwai of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō. The {{painting}} shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kichō room dividers featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Shōshi, with the baby in her arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> to be filmed—Ishaan returning {{home from school and}} putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> of the episode, {{depicting}} {{the celebration of}} King Joffrey's name day, was filmed on Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (also called St. Lawrence Fortress). The later debate {{about the nature of}} power between Cersei and Littlefinger also takes place in its porch, and in the final montage with the killing of the bastards the Old City of Dubrovnik and its famed walls can be clearly seen.|$|E

5|$|The press {{would not}} meet Dalton and d'Abo until 5 October 1986, when the main unit {{travelled}} to Vienna. Almost {{two weeks after}} the second unit filming on Gibraltar, the first unit started shooting with Andreas Wisniewski and stunt man Bill Weston. During the course of the three days it took to film this fight, Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once. The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House, doubling for Bladen's Safe House, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> Jeroen Krabbé filmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri {{looks up at the}} sky of Shizontania the night before the knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E
5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene...</b> You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

5|$|Blitzball {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of}} the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{primarily}} {{took place}} between 9 July and 11 August 2007; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> filmed depicted the group being accosted by the Host while crossing over the engines. On 12 July, Tennant's mother, Helen McDonald, began to succumb to her cancer. Filming was rescheduled to allow Tennant to be present when she died and was buried; she died on 15 July and was buried on 21 July. During Tennant's absence, scenes in the Titanics reception area were filmed at the Exchange in Swansea and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay. Tennant filmed his scenes in the area on 16 and 17 July. The last use of the Coal Exchange was on the 18th; scenes depicting the ship's collision with meteors were filmed on that day.|$|E
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E
5|$|The film {{utilized}} fascist imagery throughout, including {{portraying the}} Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those {{worn by the}} SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> of the film—an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry—was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue ("Violence is the supreme authority!"). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected his own experience in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during WW II.|$|E
5|$|Wrigley Field is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene,</b> Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball into the left field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, the TV cameras show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game with the guy behind the counter.|$|E
5000|$|Francisco Cuoco also {{entered in}} the last weeks of the novel as the farmer Rubão, husband of Eudóxia and father of Ignácio. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>scenes</b> of <b>the</b> actor aired on January 3, 2014.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>scenes</b> {{were shot}} in Portobello Road market in January 1982. The concert, speech and {{subsequent}} fight were staged at The Union Chapel in Islington, London. Others were shot in Kynance Mews, W2, London.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Close-up shot of Cameron's nude {{sketch of}} Rose wearing the [...] "Heart of the Ocean". The {{associated}} nude scene {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scenes</b> shot, as <b>the</b> main set was not yet ready.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> filmed was {{the final}} scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>scene</b> of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
