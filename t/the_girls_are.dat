It <b>is</b> essential that <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>be</b> willing, because otherwise, the puranas and shastras in The Scripture treat the incident of abduction as rape with consequent cosmic vengeance and retribution.

5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone.

He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> happy to be working as prostitutes.
