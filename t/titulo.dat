5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Spanish conquest, the Mayan {{languages}} {{began to be}} written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous Popol Vuh, a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical Quiché but believed {{to be based on}} an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The <b>Título</b> de Totonicapán and the 17th century theatrical work the Rabinal Achí are other notable early works in K'iche', the latter in the Achí dialect. The Annals of the Cakchiquels from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the Popol Vuh. The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of Chilam Balam are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions. The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the Songs of Dzitbalche by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.|$|E

25|$|A {{brief history}} of Chajoma {{movements}} and their rulers is contained in an early Colonial document entitled the <b>Título</b> de los de San Martín Jilotepeque, written in 1555.

25|$|The {{division}} of the Portuguese territory is established in title eight (<b>Título</b> VIII) of the Portuguese constitution: granting local authority to territorial collectivities with representative organs to affect {{the interests of the}} local populations. These collectivities are defined as autonomous regions, administrative regions, municipalities and civil parishes, but reserves the right of urban areas and islands to establish other forms of local authority. In defining the rights and privileges of these entities, the constitution also defines sources of income, that includes local heritage, budgets and equalization transfers from the State, in addition to defining the basic role of local government at each level.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Quiché Kingdom is {{described}} {{in a number of}} documents written in postcolonial times both in Spanish and in indigenous languages such as Classical K'iche' and Kaqchikel. Important sources include the Popol Vuh which, apart from the well-known mythology, also contains a history and genealogy of the Kaweq lineage such as the <b>Título</b> de Totonicapán. Information from these can be crosschecked with the Annals of the Cakchiquels recounting the {{history of the}} Kaqchikel vassals and later enemies of the K'iche'. A number of other títulos such as those of Sacapulas, the C'oyoi, Nijaib and Tamub titles each recount K'iche' history from the viewpoint of a specific K'iche' lineage. Other sources include those written by conquistadors and ecclesiastics, and administrative documents of the colonial administration.|$|E
25|$|Fortescue {{also wrote}} {{a number of}} mostly topical works that {{addressed}} the political conflict during the Wars of the Roses. Among the surviving works are the pamphlets De <b>titulo</b> Edwardi comitis Marchiæ (The Title of Edward, Earl of March), Of the Title of the House of York, Defensio juris domus Lancastriæ (Defence of the Rights of the House of Lancaster), Replication ageinste the Clayme, and Title of the Duke of Yorke for the Crownes of England and France, {{as well as the}} treatise Opusculum de natura legis naturæ et de ejus censura in successione regnorum suprema already mentioned. Two further works, Declaration upon Certayn Wrytinges Sent oute of Scotteland and Articles Sent to Warwick have been discussed by recent scholarship. All of Fortescue's minor writings appear in , published in 1869 for private circulation by another descendant, Thomas Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont.|$|E
500|$|The {{site was}} founded by king Q'uq'umatz around 1400 for its {{defensive}} position, however there is some disagreement {{as to whether he}} is a historical or a mythological figure. Q'uq'umatz is K'iche for feathered serpent, and feathered serpent is used as a title in other parts of Mesoamerica. [...] It is probable that Q'uq'umatz was really the title of another ajpop mentioned in the sources, Kotuja', and was actually the same individual. In the <b>Título</b> de los Señores de Totonicapán, an early Colonial era K'iche' document, he is listed as Q'uq'umatz Kotuja'. In the same title, his father is listed as Kotuja' Q'uq'umatz, and there is confusion in the K'iche' documents as to whether they were one and the same, or father and son with very similar names.|$|E

2500|$|Although Pape used a ruled {{edge and}} a compass {{to create the}} lines in Sem <b>Título</b> [...] (1959), there are slight {{variations}} in {{the width of the}} lines, revealing that a hand rather than a machine made the forms. Additionally, the rice paper's delicacy had absorbed the ink, creating imprecise edges. The black ink of the woodprint's background also reveals the natural wood grain of the block print as one can see the porous marks of the wood between the incised lines on the print. So despite the woodprint's originally Concrete identity, Sem <b>Título</b> [...] (1959), is now understood as a transitional piece from the Concrete movement into the Neo-Concrete, as it is infused with non-mechanical and [...] "handmade" [...] qualities that seem more expressive than mechanistic.|$|E

2500|$|The 1960s {{version of}} Tecelares {{is even more}} organic and {{expressive}} than the earlier 1959 version. The print shows {{the grain of the}} woodblock even more overtly in the bottom portion of the print, while the top portion remains relatively muted. As in the other prints in this series, Sem <b>Título</b> [...] (1960) is cut by diagonal lines that disrupt the continuity of the horizontal wood grain pattern, creating movement and distinct planes in the artwork, though they are considerably more subtle than the 1959 Sem <b>Título</b> [...] print of the same series. Also similar to the 1959 print, the 1960 print has the same imprecise quality created by the feathering of the ink on the rice paper. It also has a very organic quality, which is produced through the patterns and swirls of the wood grain. Because of this organic pattern, this print seems to overtly oppose the mechanic properties associated with Concrete art.|$|E

2500|$|A {{letter from}} Cardinal-Prefect [...] Franzoni, {{added to the}} acts of the council, treats of the {{question}} of how the bishops are to be supported by their dioceses. It likewise insists that priests ordained <b>titulo</b> missionis are not to enter religious orders without the consent of their ordinaries, as they are required to make oaths that they will serve perpetually in the diocese for which they were ordained.|$|E
2500|$|Already {{in medieval}} Latin palaeography, {{the sign that}} in Spanish {{came to be called}} virgulilla (meaning [...] "little comma") was used over a vowel to {{indicate}} a following nasal consonant (n or m) that had been omitted, as in tãtus for tantus or quã for quam. This usage was passed on to other languages using the Latin alphabet although it was subsequently dropped by most. Spanish retained it, however, in some specific cases, particularly to indicate the palatal nasal, the sound that is now spelt as ñ. The word tilde comes from Spanish, derived by metathesis of the word <b>título</b> as tidlo, this originally from Latin TITULUS [...] "title" [...] or [...] "heading"; compare cabildo with Latin CAPITULUM.|$|E
2500|$|The Datu Class {{was at the}} top of a divinely sanctioned {{and stable}} social order in a Sakop or Kinadatuan (Kadatuan in ancient Malay; Kedaton in Javanese; and Kedatuan in many parts of modern Southeast Asia), which is {{elsewhere}} commonly referred to also as barangay. [...] This social order was divided into three classes. The Kadatuan (members of the Visayan Datu Class) were compared by the Boxer Codex to the titled Lords (Señores de <b>titulo)</b> in Spain. As Agalon or Amo (Lords), the Datus enjoyed an ascribed right to respect, obedience, and support from their Ulipon (Commoner) or followers belonging to the Third Order. These Datus had acquired rights to the same advantages from their legal [...] "Timawa" [...] or vassals (Second Order), who bind themselves to the Datu as his seafaring warriors. [...] "Timawas" [...] paid no tribute, and rendered no agricultural labor. They had a portion of the Datu's blood in their veins. The above-mentioned Boxer Codex calls these [...] "Timawas": Knights and Hidalgos. The Spanish conquistador, Miguel de Loarca, described them as [...] "free men, neither chiefs nor slaves". In the late 17th century, the Spanish Jesuit priest Fr. Francisco Ignatio Alcina, classified them as the third rank of nobility (nobleza).|$|E
