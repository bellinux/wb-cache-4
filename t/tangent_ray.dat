Small steps must be taken in the neighborhood of vanishing Jacobians. This feature is not always pointed out in descriptions of the implementations but it is easily detected. These difficulties can be eliminated by using a somewhat different homotopy.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLower thermospheric airglow spectra in the wavelength range of 1840 A to 2280 A were analyzed. These {{data were obtained}} by the Spacelab 1 shuttle mission in November, 1983. The analysis of the seven spectra was accomplished by comparison of the data with synthetically calculated spectra for the gamma, delta, and epsilon band emissions of nitric oxide. The <b>tangent</b> <b>ray</b> heights of the measured spectra varied in two kilometer increments from 96 km to 108 km. The strengths of 31 {{of the most prominent}} 7, 6, and e band emissions were independently adjusted to achieve the best fits to the data. All of the major features in the data were identified and gave conclusive evidence of the existence of c band emissions. By fitting the double bandhead feature of the emissions, the atmospheric temperature was determined for the first time from the NO emissions and compared with the temperature profile predicted by the MSIS— 83 model. The Frank—Condon factors for the v" progression (v'= 0) of the nitric oxide e band were measured from the data and compared with theoretical calculations. The fluorescence efficiency of the 6 bands was determined to be 0. 32 ± 0. 05 by fitting the 6 (0, 1) emission feature.

40|$|During the ATLAS 1 mission {{spectral}} {{observations were}} made at middle and low latitudes of features expected from the precipitation of energetic neutral atoms. The Imaging Spectrometric Observatory was used {{at night in the}} UV and visible with maximum gain. The <b>tangent</b> <b>ray</b> heights of the look directions ranged from near 100 km to near 200 km, and the geomagnetic conditions were quiet during the observations, which were made March 28 to April 3, 1992. The N 2 (+) 1 N 391. 4 -nm and O I 130. 4 and 135. 6 -nm emissions were observed at all latitudes, with lower emission rates at lower magnetic dip latitudes, except that enhancements in the O I lines were seen within 30 deg of the dip equator to radiative recombination of ionospheric plasma. The latitude profile observed for the N 2 (+) 1 N emission did not show an equatorial or midlatitude peak. This implies that the source of energetic neutrals is more consistent with prompt charge exchange loss of freshly injected trapped ions with relatively low mirror heights (i. e., ions on higher L shells with equatorial pitch angle distributions nearly isotropic to the loss cone) than loss of highly eroded populations of particles with high mirror heights (i. e., ions on lower L shells with pancake equatorial pitch angle distributions). The N 2 (+) 1 N emission rates have been compared with models of atmospheric emission due to fluxes of O/O(+) and H/H(+) in the thermosphere, as produced by energetic neutral oxygen or hydrogen atom precipitation.

40|$|The {{occultation}} {{technique of}} determining {{the properties of the}} atmosphere using absorption spectroscopy is examined. The intensity of a star, in certain atmospheric absorption bands, is monitored by a satellite tracking the star during occultation by the Earth's atmosphere. The intensity data in certain wavelength intervals, where absorption is attributed to a single species, are related to the tangential column number density of the absorbing species through Beer's law. The equation for the tangential column number density is the Abel integral equation which is inverted to obtain the number density profile of the absorbing species at the occultation <b>tangent</b> <b>ray</b> point. Two numerical schemes for inverting the Abel integral equation for signals of low intensity with statistical noise superimposed are presented; one for determining the number density profile of atmospheric species that decrease exponentially with height, and the second for determining the profile of constituents having a more complex vertical structure, such as ozone. The accuracy of retrieving the number density distribution from planetary occultation data is examined. A theoretical analysis of the errors in determining the number density from occultation data of very low signal intensity is also presented. The errors in retrieving the number density profile are related to the intensity of the source, the number of data points per scan, and the degree of data smoothing required before inversion. As a specific example, calculations are made of the errors in retrieving the molecular oxygen and ozone number density profiles from occultation intensity data in the Schumann-Runge continuum of molecular oxygen at 1450 A and the Hartley continuum of ozone at 2450 A...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{measurements}} of the far ultraviolet dayglow were made from the ATLAS 1 shuttle mission using an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) imaging spectrometer array. The instrument imaged relatively large (177 A) segments of the spectrum simultaneously and had the capability to image altitude in the second dimension of the two-dimensional focal plane detector when the entrance slit of the instrument was oriented perpendicular to the limb of the Earth. The far ultraviolet (FUV) channel of the instrument used a CsTe photocathode rather than the more conventionally used and more solar blind CsI photocathode material. As a result, the spectra were also measured with good sensitivity at FUV wavelengths longer than 1500 A. In this paper, data are selected of specific interest to {{a study of the}} N 2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield system using two shuttle attitudes: In the first the field of view was held at a fixed <b>tangent</b> <b>ray</b> height of approximately 140 km while scanning in wavelength, providing repeated FUV spectra over a range of latitudes and allowing comparison with our thermospheric airglow model. In the second observing sequence the line of sight of the instrument was scanned down through the atmosphere but covered about 75 % of the full wavelength range. This sequence allows comparison of height dependence,including O 2 absorption effects, with the thermospheric model. In all cases, relatively good agreement is obtained with the model (run strictly in a predictive mode) in comparisions in which the line of sight must be intergrated along a path that spans a considerable range of conditions (height, local time, latitude, solar zenith angle). In the case of the data sets examined in this study the vibrational population distributions show mixed results. In one case the distribution agrees well with a theoretical model based on direct electron impact excitation without a significant cascade contribution. A second case indicated a lower population in nu' = 3 and a higher population in nu' = 6 than would be expected from direct impact excitation alone. This supports previous indications that conditions resulting in the cascade mechanism may not always be operative...|$|E
40|$|The inelastic {{response}} of materials to applied uniaxial loading is typically measured using tensile or compressive specimens of an initially circular cross-section. Under deformation, this cross-section may become elliptical due to anisotropic material behaviour. An optical technique {{for measuring the}} elliptical deformation of anisotropic, homogeneous cylindrical specimens undergoing uniaxial deformation is presented. It enables the quantification of anisotropic deformation in situ and provides data for material characterization. Three or more silhouette views of a specimen are obtained using multiple cameras or mirrored views. The positions of the edges are computed using a sub-pixel edge detection method, and 3 D <b>tangent</b> <b>rays</b> from the camera through these positions are calculated.

40|$|Neutrino {{transport}} and neutrino interactions in dense matter {{play a crucial}} role in stellar core collapse, supernova explosions and neutron star formation. Here we present a detailed description of a new numerical code for treating the time and energy dependent neutrino transport in hydrodynamical simulations of such events. The code is based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal with the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann equation. The moments of the neutrino distribution function and the energy and lepton number exchange with the stellar medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and first order moment equations in combination with a model Boltzmann equation. The latter is discretized on a grid of <b>tangent</b> <b>rays.</b> The integration of the transport equations and the neutrino source terms is performed in a time-implicit way. In the present version of the program, the transport part is coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics code which follows the evolution of the stellar plasma by a finite- volume method with piecewise parabolic interpolation, using a Riemann solver to calculate the hydrodynamic states. The neutrino source terms are implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino {{transport and}} hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial grids and different time steps. The structure of the described code is modular and offers a high degree of flexibility for an application to relativistic and multi-dimensional problems at different levels of refinement and accuracy. We critically evaluate results for a number of test cases, including neutrino transport in rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic core collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code to be used in multi- dimensional simulations of convection in neutron stars and supernovae...|$|R

To apply which Experiment, we may imagine the Atmosphere to be a great transparent Globe, which being of a substance more dense then the other, or (which comes to the same) that has its parts more dense towards the middle, the Sun beams that are tangents, or next within the tangents of this Globe, will be refracted or inflected from their direct passage towards the center of the Globe, whence, according to the laws of refractions made in a triangular Prism, and the generation of colour set down in the description of Muscovi-glass there must necessarily appear a red colour in the transitus or passage of those <b>tangent</b> <b>Rays.</b> To make this more plain, we will suppose (in the sixth Figure) ABCD, to represent the Globe of the Atmosphere, EFGH to represent the opacous Globe of the Earth, lying in the midst of it, neer to which, the parts of the Air, sustaining a very great pressure, are thereby very much condens'd, from whence those Rays that are by inflection made tangents to the Globe of the Earth, and those without them, that pass through the more condens'd part of the Atmosphere, as suppose between A and E, are by reason of the inequality of the medium, inflected towards the center, whereby there must necessarily be generated a red colour, as is more plainly shewn in the former cited place; hence whatsoever opacous bodies (as vapours, or the like) shall chance to be elevated into those parts, will reflect a red towards the eye; and therefore those evenings and mornings appear reddest, that have the most store of vapours and halituous substances exhaled to a convenient distance from the Earth; for thereby the inflection is made the greater, and thereby the colour also the more intense; and several of those exhalations being opacous, reflect several of those Rays, which, through an Homogeneous transparent medium would pass unseen; and therefore we see, that when there chances to be any clouds situated in those Regions they reflect a strong and vivid red. Now, though one great cause of the redness may be this inflection, yet I cannot wholly exclude the colour of the vapours themselves, which may have something of redness in them, they being partly nitrous; and partly fuliginous; both which steams tinge the Rays that pass through them, as is made evident by looking at bodies through the fumes of Aqua fortis or spirit of Nitre [as the newly mentioned Illustrious Person has demonstrated] and also through the smoak of a Fire or Chimney.|$|R

40|$|We express {{classical}} Hamiltonian ray optics {{for light}} rays in axisymmetric f bers as a Lie-Poisson dynamical system defined in R 3, {{regarded as the}} dual of the Lie algebra sp(2, •). The ray-tracing dynamics i interpreted geometrically as motion in ~ 3 along the intersections of two-dimensional level surfaces of the conserved optical Hamiltonian and the skewness invariant (the analog of angular momentum, conserved because of the axisymmetry of the medium). In this geometrical picture, a Hamiltonian level surface is a vertically oriented cylinder whose cross section describes the radial profile of the refractive index, and a level surface of the skewness function is a hyperboloid ofrevolution around a horizontal axis. Points of tangency of these surfaces are equilibria, which are stable when the Gaussian curvature of the Hamiltonian level surface (constrained by the skewness function) is negative definite at the equilibrium point. Examples are discussed for various radial profiles of the refractive index. This discussion places optical ray tracing in fibers into the geometrical setting of Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian dynamics and {{provides an example of}} optical ray trapping within separatrices (homoclinic orbits). 1.
