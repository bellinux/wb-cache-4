5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less <b>toxic</b> <b>product</b> urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less <b>toxic</b> <b>product,</b> by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E

National environmental enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the English and Welsh Environment Agency, put strict limits on the levels of gases containing hydrogen sulfide, and, if the levels of hydrogen sulfide in the gas are high, gas scrubbing and cleaning equipment (such as amine gas treating) will be needed to process the biogas to within regionally accepted levels. Alternatively, the addition of ferrous chloride FeCl2 to the digestion tanks inhibits hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E

50|$|A 2011 {{study of}} fire {{toxicity}} of insulating materials at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Fire and Hazard Science studied PIR and other commonly used materials under more realistic and wide-ranging conditions {{representative of a}} wider range of fire hazard, observing that most fire deaths resulted from <b>toxic</b> <b>product</b> inhalation. The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR > PUR > EPS > PHF; glass and stone wools also studied). In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between equivalence ratio and yields of CO {{and other products}} has been studied in detail {{for a wide range}} of materials during flaming combustion using two small-scale apparatus designed specifically for this purpose—the ASTM E 2058 fire propagation apparatus (Tewarson 2002) and the ISO/TS 19700 tube furnace apparatus (ISO/TS 19700 2013), in conjunction with a series of large-scale experiments used for validation (Gottuk & Lattimer 2002; Blomqvist & Lonnermark 2001; Purser & Purser 2008 a). The findings from these studies demonstrated that yields of different <b>toxic</b> <b>products</b> are highly dependent on equivalence ratio (either positively or negatively correlated), and elemental and molecular composition of the material. To a lesser extent, parameters such as temperature and oxygen concentration also affect the yields of <b>toxic</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of recent historical studies on <b>toxic</b> <b>products.</b> First, we offer {{an introduction to the}} literature and the principal academic groups, describing the major trends in four different areas of scholarship: history of crime and forensic science, history of food quality and adulteration, history of occupational and public health, and environmental history. Second, we suggest avenues for future research by highlighting three meeting points: protagonists, spaces and proof. We also discuss some challenges of the historical narratives: the agency of human and non-human actors; the integration of material, human and environmental effects; and the combination of the socio-cultural analysis of historical cases with the current understanding of poisons. While avoiding the unforgivable sins of anachronism or, even worse, of technological determinism, we want to encourage historical narratives with a bearing on current affairs. This is the last point discussed in the final conclusions. We claim that the history of <b>toxic</b> <b>products</b> can raise long-term debates, decenter the current focus, look for hybrid and complex causations, deconstruct the technocratic discourse of experts, empower victims, question legal standpoints and received cultural constructs, or point out the difficulties of democratic decision-making processes in matters regarding <b>toxic</b> <b>products,</b> particularly in a world marked by an uneven distribution of power and risks. In this sense, we claim that a history of <b>toxic</b> <b>products</b> can create new links between historians and social movements, academic research and activism, while enlarging the opportunities for fostering the uses of history in policy-making. In order to follow this promising path, we argue the need of crossing disciplinary borders of the history of crime, the history of occupational health, and food and environmental history, while moving outside academia and engaging in public debates...|$|R
