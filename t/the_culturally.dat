5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between <b>the</b> <b>culturally</b> totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by <b>the</b> <b>culturally</b> reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began {{penetrating}} into medieval Armenia and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, starting the Turkification process in the area; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. Alongside the Turkification of the territory, <b>the</b> <b>culturally</b> Persianized Seljuks set the basis for a Turko-Persian principal culture in Anatolia, which their eventual successors, the Ottomans, would take over.|$|E

25|$|The {{extensive}} Prussian Eastern Railway {{linked the}} city to Breslau, Thorn, Insterburg, Eydtkuhnen, Tilsit, and Pillau.

Extensive electric tramways were in operation by 1900; and regular steamers plied to Memel, Tapiau and Labiau, Cranz, Tilsit, and Danzig. The completion of a canal to Pillau in 1901 increased the trade of Russian grain in Königsberg, but, like much of eastern Germany, the city's economy was generally in decline. By 1900 the city's population had grown to 188,000, with a 9,000-strong military garrison.

25|$|Roti is eaten widely {{across the}} Caribbean, {{especially}} {{in countries with}} large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in <b>the</b> <b>culturally</b> rich cuisines of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana, and Jamaica. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flat-bread (roti) itself {{as well as the}} more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling {{in the form of a}} wrap.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} start of his {{professional}} practice as an architect Dyson sought to demonstrate architecture as a force for community good, particularly in an unpublicized commitment to bring professional architectural services to the causes of <b>the</b> <b>culturally</b> disadvantaged. Notable unbuilt projects during this period include the Monterey Institute for the Arts project (1966) in Pacific Grove, California, and the American Indian Center project (1975) in Fresno, California, a museum facility done pro bono to showcase objects relating {{the history of the}} Mono and Yokuts people of central California. In 1971, Dyson developed two schemes for a publicly subsidized children’s center constructed in Orange Cove, California that combined both a Head Start and day care operation. By serving at this same time as chairman of the Urban Planning Task Force in Fresno, Dyson commenced a lifelong journey in public service. He also began to lecture at colleges, universities, and museums as outreach for progressive design principles.|$|E
