5|$|The finds were {{purchased}} by the museum in April 2009 and underwent conservation by specialists at Durham University and York Archaeological Trust. Using tools of the Anglo-Saxon period, a replica of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> created for the exhibition by Richard Darrah, an expert in early woodwork, and blacksmith Hector Cole, a crafter of medieval-style ironwork. A short film about the princess was made at the Anglo-Saxon museum at Bede's World in Jarrow with a narration by Stephen Tompkinson. Prior {{to the opening of}} the exhibition at Kirkleatham, the finds were put on display for five days in May 2011 at Loftus Town Hall, where they attracted nearly 1,700 visitors.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 was a deep, wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society. Such burials are highly unusual; only a dozen are known in the whole of the UK, and the one at Street House is the most northerly known.|$|E

5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The bed {{is in the form of}} a high platform with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E
25|$|There was {{considerable}} media attention regarding the apparently trivial and possibly unhygienic {{elements of the}} installation, such as yellow stains on the bedsheets, condoms, empty cigarette packets, {{and a pair of}} knickers with menstrual stains. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> presented as it had been when she had stayed in it for several days, feeling suicidal because of relationship difficulties.|$|E

In fact in patrician households <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> often placed in a reception room for the occasion (if there was not one already in such a room, after the fashion of the French and Burgundian courts), and the mother lay there while receiving visits from her friends over several days.|$|E

500|$|Although nothing {{remains of}} either the body or the bed, {{surviving}} artefacts and the 56 pieces of ironwork that held the bed together have enabled the burial to be reconstructed in considerable detail. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> made from ash wood, held together {{with a variety of}} iron plates, cleats, staples, nails, stays, and decorative scrolls. It measured [...] and may once have been roofed with an ornamental awning or canvas, perhaps made of cloth draped over timber posts. Traces of mineralised cloth and either grass or reed were found still attached to some of the nails, indicating the possible nature of the mattress. Two pieces of ironwork showed signs of repair and reuse, suggesting that the bed had been in use some time before the burial and was not specially made for the interment. This raises the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> either that of the deceased woman or a significant bed of some other person. It may have been dismantled elsewhere, brought to the cemetery and reassembled and repaired so that it could be used for the burial.|$|E
500|$|In 1923 a {{memorial}} fund {{was raised in}} Gould's name, the donations of which {{were given to the}} Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. The hospital recognised the gift with the Arthur Gould Memorial Bed, inscribed: [...] "To the memory of Arthur Gould – Greatest of Rugby Football Players". <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> lost, however, when a portion of the hospital was demolished. Donations for the memorial, which totalled £1,525, were received from all over the world, and several matches were staged to raise funds, including a fixture between Newport and Cardiff.|$|E
500|$|What {{followed}} was a bedding ceremony {{laid down by}} Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort: <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> sprinkled with holy water, after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies-in-waiting. She was undressed, veiled and [...] "reverently" [...] laid in bed, while Arthur, [...] "in his shirt, with a gown cast about him", was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber, while viols and tabors played. The Bishop of London blessed the bed and prayed for the marriage to be fruitful, after which the couple were left alone. This is the only public bedding of a royal couple recorded in Britain in the 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Investigating {{events at}} Metropolis, Jonathan deduces that Gessler's {{grandfather}} was a Nazi sympathizer, who laid a trap in the attic room to kill one of his enemies without arousing suspicion. Jonathan and Joey {{spend the night in}} the room, but uncover nothing, save for a small vent in the canopy of the room's four-poster bed, which is opened when pressure is put on the mattress, releasing dead flies. The next morning, Jonathan comes to the realization that the vent above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> designed to leak a [...] fluid onto the room's occupants as they slept, meaning they would need to bathe in the adjoining bathroom. Upon realizing the secret behind the disappearances, Jonathan races back up to the attic with Glenn. Unfortunately, Joey had already climbed into the bath, which has descended and released her into a water tank below the room, where the corpses of previous victims (including her friend Mina) remain, drowned and decomposing. The bath has not yet returned to its position so Jonathan and Glenn are able to rescue her. The mystery resembles the real-life case of the Jarmans, the sixteenth-century owners of the Ostrich Inn in Slough (Berkshire), who killed wealthy travelers by tipping them into a barrel of boiling water via a hinged bed in one of the bedrooms.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not know any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E

[...] Labor could also be quickened by placing a snakeskin around the thigh. [...] A sharp object placed under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> believed to “cut” the labor pains or stop hemorrhaging.

Later, it came into the possession of the Universal Studios prop department, and it was used in the 1925 film The Phantom of the Opera. [...] In 1934, it was used as Lily Garland's bed in Twentieth Century and in 1950, it was in Sunset Boulevard as the bed of Norma Desmond. In 1964, it appeared in a dream sequence in the film [...] "Good Neighbor Sam".|$|E

2500|$|The Garter Room {{now known}} as [...] "The Servery", which served as the State Bedroom is {{to the west of}} The Small Tapestry Dining Room.

There is a reconstruction of the original plaster ceiling with its Garter insignia in the centre. The most important painting in the room, that used to hang on the east wall, was Joshua Reynolds's Marquess of Granby, now {{in the collection of the}} National Army Museum, Earl Temple's nephew Richard Grenville was the Marquess's Aide-de-camp during the Seven Years' War. The magnificent state bed which was set up in the room in 1759-60 and was nearly [...] in height, survives in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. It used to be in the recess on the west wall. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> moved to the Rembrandt Room for Queen Victoria's visit. The two elaborately carved and gilt robe chests, one of gophir the other of sandalwood that used to stand on the north wall flanking the white marble fireplace are now in the Wallace Collection. The room takes up the space behind the two western tripartite windows of the South Front, the corners of the room prior to 1935 contained separate closets. The south-western closet was called the Japan Closet and was decorated in a Japanese style, this used to contain the Chandos Jewels finally sold for nearly £10,000 by Lady Kinloss in 1929, also the room used to have a staircase to the dressing room on the floor above. The south-eastern closet was called the Shakespeare Closet because it contained the Chandos portrait of William Shakespeare now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, also from this room and now in the National Gallery, London, are two paintings, a portrait of Martin Luther which used to be ascribed to Hans Holbein the Younger and Francesco Raibolini's portrait of Bartolomeo Bianchini. The north-east closet was a water-closet. In the niches in the walls that flank the recess between the two southern closets used to be displayed a collection 120 pieces of Maiolica.
