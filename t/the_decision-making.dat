This study tentatively suggests that only three full steps of <b>the</b> conventional <b>decision-making</b> process are used in <b>the</b> urgent <b>decision-making</b> process.

5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè).

40|$|Intuition {{can produce}} {{effective}} strategic decisions {{because of its}} speed and ability to solve less-structured problems. Despite this, {{there are only a}} very small number of empirical studies that have examined intuition in <b>the</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> process. We examine the relationship between the use of intuition in <b>the</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> process, and strategic decision effectiveness. We propose that the expertise of the decision-maker, environmental dynamism and the characteristics of the strategic decision itself moderate the relationship between the use of intuition in the strategic decision making process, and strategic decision effectiveness. We make a significant theoretical contribution by integrating the management and social-psychology literatures in order to identify the variables that affect the relationship between the use of intuition in <b>the</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> process, and strategic decision effectiveness. This article builds upon existing empirical research that has examined intuition in <b>the</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> process, and reconciles some of the confounding results that have emerged.

Owing to the introduction of <b>the</b> response time <b>decision-making,</b> <b>the</b> intrusion response system can apply different response strategies to achieve different response goals set by administrators.
