5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes.

The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worn,</b> with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worn</b> in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
