50|$|The {{transformer}} can {{be equipped}} with extra windings whose sole purpose {{is to have a}} relatively large voltage pulse induced in them when the magnetic field collapses as the input switch is turned off. There is considerable energy stored in the magnetic field and coupling it out via extra windings helps it to collapse quickly, and avoids the voltage flash over that might otherwise occur. The pulse train coming from the flyback transformer windings is converted to direct current by a simple half wave rectifier. There is no point in using a full wave design as there are no corresponding pulses of opposite polarity. One turn of a winding often produces pulses of several volts. In older television designs, the transformer produced the required high voltage for the CRT accelerating voltage directly with the output rectified by a simple rectifier. In more modern designs, the rectifier is replaced by a voltage multiplier. Color television sets also have to use a regulator to control the high voltage. The earliest sets used a shunt vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>regulator,</b> but the introduction of solid state sets employed a simpler voltage dependant resistor. The rectified voltage is then used to supply the final anode of the cathode ray tube.|$|E

5000|$|Any {{vacuum tube}} {{operating}} at several thousand volts or more can produce X-rays as an unwanted byproduct, raising safety issues. [...] The higher the voltage, the more penetrating the resulting radiation {{and the more}} the hazard. CRT displays, once common in color televisions and computer displays, operate at 3-40 kilovolts, making them the main concern among household appliances. Historically, concern has focused less on the cathode ray tube, since its thick glass envelope is impregnated with several pounds of lead for shielding, than on high voltage (HV) rectifier and voltage <b>regulator</b> <b>tubes</b> inside. In the late 1960s {{it was found that}} a failure in the HV supply circuit of some General Electric TVs could leave excessive voltages on the <b>regulator</b> <b>tube,</b> causing it to emit X-rays. The models were recalled and the ensuing scandal caused the US agency responsible for regulating this hazard, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to require that all TVs include circuits to prevent excessive voltages in the event of failure. The hazard associated with excessive voltages was eliminated with the advent of all solid state TVs, which have no tubes beside the CRT. Since 1969 the FDA has limited TV X-ray emission to 0.5 mR (milliroentgen) per hour. The flat screens used today do not have any vacuum tubes capable of emitting X-rays.|$|R

50|$|Many {{types of}} cold-cathode {{switching}} tube were developed, including {{various types of}} thyratron, the krytron, cold cathode displays (Nixie tube) and others. Voltage <b>regulator</b> <b>tubes</b> rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current, and were used to stabilize power supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A Dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting. Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by {{the position of the}} glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of integrated circuit counter devices.|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{performance}} of a batch flow treatment of landfillleachate compared with a continuous flow system. The parameters in focus were total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), BOD 5 and COD. The pilot-scale experiment used eight barrels with a volume of 150 liters. Each barrel was constructed differently concerning its flow, its bed material grain size and its presence of plants or not. Four of the barrels worked in batch mode, thus four in continuous flow mode. The continuous flow systems were provided with water trough small <b>tubes</b> with <b>regulators.</b> Samples were collected once a week and analysis was carried out yielding results of BOD 5, COD, TKN, pH and conductivity of the effluents. The same parameters were analyzed for the influent every week. The result shows that a wetland is a good way of treating the landfill leachate as the BOD 5, COD and TKN decreases. Moreover the color, which contravenes with legislative demands in the region, was distinctly decreased. Yet the report failed to show a significant difference between batch loaded and continuous flow wetlands. More studies have to be carried out in order to determine or contradict whether batch mode in fact provides a better treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) {{signal transduction}} pathways display remarkable homology to the Toll signaling cascade in Drosophila. To {{address the question}} whether members of the Drosophila Toll pathway are functional in mammalian cells, inactive and constitutively active versions of the protein kinase Pelle and its <b>regulator</b> <b>Tube</b> were expressed in HeLa cells and tested for their impact on IL- 1 -dependent signaling events. The Drosophila proteins failed to induce the IL- 1 -responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB, but selectively activated the IL- 1 -regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), thus resulting in elevated AP- 1 activity. Activation of JNK/AP- 1 activity was seen upon expression of a Pelle mutant lacking its C-terminal half or by a membrane-bound and multimerised Tube protein, showing the functionality of the Drosophila proteins in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|In many {{mammalian}} species, {{the intestinal}} epithelium undergoes major changes that allow a dietary transition from mother’s milk to the adult diet {{at the end}} of the suckling period. These complex developmental changes are the result of a genetic programme intrinsic to the gut <b>tube,</b> but its <b>regulators</b> have not been identified. Here we show that transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp 1) is highly expressed in the developing and postnatal intestinal epithelium until the suckling to weaning transition. Intestine-specific deletion of Blimp 1 results in growth retardation and excessive neonatal mortality. mutant mice lack all of the typical epithelial features of the suckling period and are born with features of an adult-like intestine. We conclude that the suckling to weaning transition is regulated by a single transcriptional repressor that delays epithelial maturation...|$|R

Generally, if the recovery factor is greater than 80  % when hydrocarbon gas breakthrough occurs or the ultimate oil recovery reaches 90  %– 95  % after 1.2 pore volume (PV) hydrocarbon gas is injected, it is treated as a state of miscibility.

50|$|In the 1930s, tubes {{often had}} the {{connection}} to the control grid brought out through a metal top cap {{on the top of}} the tube. This was connected by using a clip with an attached wire lead. An example would be the 6A7 pentagrid converter. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or anode lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube's output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for color television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage <b>regulator</b> <b>tubes.)</b> A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.|$|R
40|$|Branched tubular organs, such as {{the lung}} and {{vascular}} system fulfill the respiratory needs of most animals. Optimal tissue function relies on the uniform sizes and shapes of the constituting branches in each organ. The Drosophila tracheal airways provide a recognized genetic model system for identification and characterization of <b>tube</b> size <b>regulators.</b> We found that the programmed secretion and assembly of the apical extracellular matrix (ECM) {{is required for the}} expansion of the trachea and salivary glands (SG) tubes. We have characterized Vermiform (Verm) and Serpentine (Serp), two chitin-binding proteins with predicted polysaccharide deacetylase domains (ChLDs). Verm and Serp mutants show overelongated tubes, suggesting that luminal ECM modification restricts tracheal tube elongation. The luminal deposition of ChLDs, but not other secreted components, depends on paracellular septate junction integrity (SJs) in the tracheal epithelium. Deletion of the deacetylase domain renders Serp-GFP intracellular, arguing that the deacetylase domain harbors uncharacterized secretion signals. To explore this possibility we transferred the deacetylase domain from Serp to Gasp, another tracheal luminal protein, which requires the Emp 24 adaptor for ER exit. The Gasp-Deac-GFP chimera was normally secreted in emp 24 mutants indicating that the deacetylase domain contains potential ER-exit signals. To identify such signals we characterized conserved sequence motifs in the Serp deacetylase domain. Mutations of the N-glycosylation sites gradually reduced Serp-GFP luminal deposition suggesting that increased glycosylation enhances apical Serp secretion. By contrast, substitutions in three conserved amino acid stretches completely blocked the ER-exit of Serp-GFP. The mutated proteins were N-glycosylated suggesting that the motifs may be involved in a subsequent protein-folding step or facilitate ER exit through interactions with unidentified specific adaptors. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 4 : Manuscript...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{difficulty}} to anesthetize small laboratory {{animals with}} vaporizer prompted {{us to go}} in search of new materials, and create new techniques. The improved equipment of anesthesia we looked for should be low cost, practical, versatile, and its management serve ethical, teaching, and research purposes. METHODS: The new components of the equipment were: the vaporizer, the unidirectional valve, the glass cylinder filled with water, the flow guidance y-shape <b>tube,</b> the flow <b>regulators,</b> the mask modifications, and another free airway for emergency occurrence. A test was done with 30 Wistar rats, Rattus norvegicus albinus, divided into three groups with 10 rats for each one. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were anesthetized with Ether, Halothane and Sevoflurane respectively, using the new gadget. The anesthetic induction time, the breathing rhythm alteration during an anesthesia pre-established time (10 minutes), and the recovery time were observed.

The test showed {{it was possible to}} make use of several anesthetic agents. CONCLUSION: The device is effective, and turns the anesthesia procedure into a very easy practice with low-cost.
