50|$|In July 1998 Samuel Boyden, a {{researcher}} for State Farm Insurance, {{received a call}} from a claims handler asking for information about <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> in Firestone tires. The researcher found 21 cases of accidents caused by <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> and forwarded the information to the NHTSA. In 1999 he found an additional 30 cases and forwarded that information to the NHTSA.|$|E
5000|$|It is also {{fairly common}} for <b>tread</b> <b>separations</b> to be termed “blowouts”, even those where the {{inflation}} pressure is not compromised. Because of this confusion, {{the term is}} rarely used by experts in tire failures, where the term [...] "impact damage" [...] is more frequently used.|$|R
5000|$|Often, trail {{segregation}} for {{a particular}} use is accompanied by prohibitions against that use on other trails within the trail system. Trail segregation may be supported by signage, markings, trail design and construction (especially selection of tread materials), and by <b>separation</b> between parallel <b>treads.</b> <b>Separation</b> may be achieved by [...] "natural" [...] barriers including distance, ditching, banking, grading, and vegetation, and by [...] "artificial" [...] barriers including fencing, curbing, and walls.|$|R
40|$|Rolling resistance, noise generation, {{and wear}} are all {{determined}} by the interaction process between the rolling automotive vehicle tyre and the road. A deep understanding of the interaction process is needed for optimisation aiming at reducing these effects. Details in the tyre/road contact interface are considered in the presented work; non-linear contact stiffness and adherence forces at the interface are investigated and modelled. A description of the tyre structure and especially its tread layer is required for contact modelling. The dynamic responses of smooth and patterned passenger-car tyres are experimentally investigated. Experimental results are used to validate a high-frequency tyre model based on the elastic field equations, which includes the local deformation of the <b>tread.</b> The <b>separation</b> process when tyre tread blocks are rapidly separated from road surfaces is investigated in an experiment. This process is described {{with the aid of}} the total contact force and noise generation. Based on the experimental results, a model for the adherence force as a function of load, load duration, and unloading rate is proposed. Optimisation of the tyre/road interaction including interfacial details requires time-domain contact models including a wide range of length-scales. The strategy is to divide the contact problem into different ranges of length-scales. A model based on statistical description of the contact geometry is used on the smallest length-scales. A tread block in contact with the road surface is modelled on intermediate length-scales, and on the largest length-scales is a contact model of the complete tyre structure rolling over the road surface. The two latter models use a numerical time-domain contact formulation with a discretised contact geometry. These three models are connected via constitutive relations between contact pressure and relative displacements, incorporated as non-linear springs between the contact elements. The modelling approach is still under development but preliminary results are presented...|$|R
50|$|Some outside {{observers}} have speculated about the blame worthiness of both parties. Firestone's tires being prone to <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> and failure, and the SUVs being especially prone to rolling over if a tire fails at speed {{compared to other}} vehicles. A subsequent NHTSA investigation of real world accident data showed that the Ford Explorer SUVs in question were {{no more likely to}} roll over than any other SUV, after a <b>tread</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After Ford Motor Company voluntarily {{recalled}} 13 million Firestone {{tires on}} May 21, 2001, Firestone {{requested that the}} NHTSA investigate the handling and safety of Ford Explorers following a <b>tread</b> <b>separation.</b> Firestone argued that the Explorer is poorly designed and exhibits dangerous oversteer in the foreseeable event that a tire fails while driving. Firestone hired a consulting engineer to analyze {{the performance of the}} Ford Explorer and other SUV's during a <b>tread</b> <b>separation,</b> this report showed that the Explorer had a greater tendency to oversteer following a <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> than other SUV's. The NHTSA examined this report as well as real-world accident data and data provided by Ford concerning the design of the Explorer and denied Firestone's request. The NHTSA stated that [...] "the many crashes following tread separations of tires on these vehicles that are documented in the Firestone claims database and that have been reported to ODI by consumers and others demonstrate that such a tire failure can lead to loss of control, particularly when it is a rear tire that fails and the vehicle is being driven at high speed. However, the fact that a vehicle exhibits linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> does not, in itself, indicate that the vehicle contains a safety-related defect. Moreover, the data available to ODI does not indicate that Explorers... are more likely to exhibit linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> than many of their peers." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 Firestone added a nylon cap {{to reduce}} the problem of <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> {{in all of its}} tire models {{installed}} on SUV's.|$|E

50|$|During the {{retreading}} process, retread technicians {{must ensure}} the casing {{is in the}} best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure. Casings with problems such as capped tread, <b>tread</b> <b>separation,</b> irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected.|$|E
50|$|Improved safety: Under-inflated tires lead to <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> and tire failure, {{resulting}} in 40,000 accidents, 33,000 injuries and over 650 deaths per year. Further, tires properly inflated add greater stability, handling and braking efficiencies and provide greater safety for the driver, the vehicle, the loads {{and others on}} the road.|$|E
5000|$|Clarence Ditlow; Executive Director for the Centre for Auto Safety in his {{statement}} before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in Washington D.C., September 20, 2000 stated [...] "Emerging Information shows that both Ford and Firestone had early knowledge of <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> in Firestone Tires fitted to Ford Explorer vehicles but at no point informed the NHTSA of their findings".|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1996 {{personal}} injury lawyers {{were aware of}} high speed <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> in Firestone tires leading to accidents, injuries and fatalities. Lawyers and traffic safety researchers decided not to contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because they lacked confidence in the agency and feared that an investigation might conclude {{that there were no}} defects thereby compromising existing personal injury lawsuits. All but 13 of the 271 fatalities from these tires took place after 1996.|$|E
50|$|Tires: Problems with a vehicle's tires {{may result}} in the {{unexpected}} loss of control of a vehicle, due to such problems as reduced traction or a sudden loss of tire pressure during operation of the vehicle. Defects in the design or manufacture of a tire {{may result in}} tire <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> of sidewall failure, even during normal use. Incorrect maintenance information provided by a manufacturer may cause a vehicle owner to overinflate or underinflate tires, reducing safety.|$|E
50|$|Ford {{was also}} criticized for <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> and tire {{disintegration}} of many Firestone tires installed on Ford Explorers, Mercury Mountaineers, and Mazda Navajos, which caused many crashes {{during the late}} 1990s and early 2000s (decade). It is estimated that over 250 deaths and more than 3,000 serious injuries resulted from these failures. Although Firestone received most of the blame, some blame fell on Ford, which advised customers to under-inflate the tires {{in order to reduce}} the risk of vehicle rollovers.|$|E
50|$|USA: June 2007: Foreign Tire Sales Inc. recalls tires {{imported}} from Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., of Hangzhou, China. The tires {{were not made}} to safety standards to prevent <b>tread</b> <b>separation,</b> a problem {{that led to the}} nation's largest tire recall in 2000 by Ford Motor Company. Foreign Tire Sales Inc., was unable to comply with the recall due to its limited resources. Further, Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber doesn't have accountability for a recall since the company is based solely in China and sells in the US through third-party re-sellers.|$|E
5000|$|Explorer {{rollover}} rates, at {{the time}} of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. A rollover study analysis of national and Florida crash statistics revealed, the Ford Explorer, even when fitted with tires other than Firestone, had a higher rate of tire-related accidents than other sport utility vehicles. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control many Ford Explorer Firestone tire <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle [...]|$|E
50|$|In May 2000, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{contacted}} Ford and Firestone about {{a higher}} than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, Mercury Mountaineers, and Mazda Navajos fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved <b>tread</b> <b>separation,</b> in which the outer tread carcass would delaminate and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of 15 in Firestone tires (ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT) had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's Decatur, Illinois plant.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, Firestone {{experienced}} {{major problems}} with the Firestone 500 radial. The Firestone 500 steel-belted radials began {{to show signs of}} separation of the tread at high speeds. While the cause was never proved, it is believed that the failure of bonding cements, used by Firestone to hold the tread to the tire carcass, may have allowed water to penetrate the tire which in turn may have caused the internal steel wire to corrode. In March 1978, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced publicly a formal investigation into defects of the Firestone 500. The NHTSA investigation found that the <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> problem was most probably a design defect affecting all Firestone 500's.|$|E
50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> in severe cases.|$|E
50|$|This {{contributed to}} {{build-up}} {{of heat and}} tire deterioration under sustained high speed use, and eventual failure {{of the most highly}} stressed tire. Of course, the possibility that slightly substandard tire construction and slightly higher than average tire stress, neither of which would be problematic in themselves, would in combination result in tire failure is quite likely. The controversy continues without unequivocal conclusions, but it also brought public attention to a generally high incidence of rollover accidents involving SUVs, which the manufacturers continue to address in various ways. A subsequent NHTSA investigation of real world accident data showed that the SUVs in question were no more likely to roll over than any other SUV, after a <b>tread</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{failure of}} the subject tires [...] "begin as belt-edge {{separation}} {{at the edge of}} the second belt. This is the area of highest strain in a steel belted radial tire, primarily due to the structural discontinuity created by the abrupt change in modulus from steel to rubber." [...] Once a <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> begins it can grow along the circumference of the tire or laterally across the width of the tire leading to cracks that grow between the belts. As separation progressed it could grow to form large crescent shaped areas along one or both sides of the tire. If those areas grew large enough they could separate catastrophically, especially at high speeds where the separation was aided by the centrifugal force of the spinning tire.|$|E
50|$|A caution {{came out}} {{early in the}} race due to debris {{when one of the}} track's caution lights fell onto the track itself. Another caution came out on lap 43 when Kurt Busch spun due to tire <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> on his left rear tire. Caution #4 came out when Joe Nemecheck over {{corrected}} for over steer and hit the wall. Caution #5 came out around lap 102 due to debris on the track. Caution #6 on 160 was also due debris that was from a small piece of another caution light falling on the track. Caution #7 came out with 70 laps to go due to Robby Gordon spinning out. Caution #8 came out due to Marcos Ambrose's car hitting a wall, after which Jimmie Johnson won the race, leading 228 of 250 laps. Three drivers - Johnson, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Jeff Burton - all locked up spots in the 2008 Chase for the Sprint Cup. Greg Biffle, who finished second, also all but wrapped up a spot in the Chase as well, and all he'll have to do is qualify his car and start in Richmond next week.|$|E
5000|$|According to CNN, Nasser was [...] "point man" [...] in {{the dispute}} between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety. After an {{investigation}} in early 2000 found that <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> on Firestone tires had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers, Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others. Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer {{as one of the}} safer SUVs on the market. On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall. Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault. On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was [...] "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires." [...] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year, with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles. The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.|$|E
40|$|Decreasing vehicle {{understeer}} {{was strongly}} associated with the likelihood of control loss following both the unexpected and expected tire failures. Knowledge of the imminent <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> reduced the overall probability of control loss from 55 % to 20 % and {{had a significant effect}} on how quickly drivers responded {{as well as on the}} nature of their initial responses (i. e., steering orbraking). Driver age was marginally associated with increased likelihood of vehicle control loss, but only on unexpected trials. Vehicle speed at the time of first steering input also contributed to the probability of control loss. Neither the location of the tire that failed (left rear vs. right rear) nor the specific instructions about how best to respond to the <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> influenced the probability of control loss. Differences associated with vehicle understeer conditions observed in the present study were large and consistent, independent of driver expectations and across driver age groups. It is thus fair to conclude that in the event of a complete rear-tire detread, the increased difficulty in vehicle handling and the associated increased likelihood of loss of vehicle control with decreasing vehicle understeer generalize to real-world driving. One hundred and eight (108) subjects experienced two tire failures while driving on a straight divided highway at approximately 75 mph with light surrounding traffic. Subjects were divided equally into three age groups (18 - 25, 35 - 45, 55 - 65) and gender was balanced. Drivers were assigned to one of three understeer conditions. Understeer conditions were referred to as Vehicle 1 (understeer gradient of approximately 4. 7 deg/g), Vehicle 2 (3. 4 deg/g), and Vehicle 3 (2. 4 deg/g). Following left rear tire detread, the understeer gradients resulting from a right turn changed to 1. 10, 0. 09, and  1. 17 deg/g, respectively. The first tire failure was unexpected. The second tire failure was expected, with half of the subjects being given specific instructions on how to respond to a tire failure and the other half were told only that one or more tire failures would likely occur. A study was conducted to investigate drivers' reactions to <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> scenarios using the National Advanced DrivingSimulator (NADS). The objectives were to evaluate the effects of vehicle understeer gradient, prior knowledge of an impendingtire failure, instructions on how to respond to a tire failure, driver age, and failed tire location on drivers' responses and the likelihood of control loss following simulated <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> on one of the rear tires of a simulated SUV traveling at high speed.

40|$|Analyses of {{real-world}} {{tire tread}} belt detachment and/or sudden air loss events {{as well as}} vehicle testing of those events have been presented in scientific literature since the 1990 ’s. These confirm that such tire failures are complex and semi-random events that produce numerous sensory feedback cues to real-world drivers. These analyses further demonstrate that vehicles representing a full spectrum of steering characteristics are typically controllable and are controlled by drivers both {{during and after the}} tire disablement event. In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) sponsored a study using the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) to evaluate the technical hypothesis that there is a correlation between vehicle linear range understeer gradient and the likelihood of control loss when subject drivers experience a simulated tread belt detachment. The NADS subjects “drove” three simulated “vehicles” with different understeer gradients in a simulated <b>tread</b> <b>separation</b> even. The study’s authors reached conclusions regarding the drivers’ ability to control the “vehicles” which were inconsistent with real-world research. This paper presents an analysis of the NADS study performed to identify possible causes of the conflicting results and provides commentary upon several deficiencies noted in the NADS vehicle/tire modeling and validation. A more comprehensive understanding of the reported driver reactions when viewed in light of real vehicle experiments, real-world data, and an understanding of the limitations of the simulations is provided...|$|E
