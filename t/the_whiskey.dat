5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion {{demonstrated}} that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> excise remained difficult to collect.

5|$|Older {{accounts}} of <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion portrayed {{it as being}} confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). <b>The</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|The Washington administration's {{suppression}} of <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode {{demonstrated that the}} new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention, however, that <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. <b>The</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax, westerners {{had a number}} of other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was {{a hotbed}} of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption. Several factors fed into {{resistance}} to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.|$|E
5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly {{and the right to}} petition.|$|E

5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up. <b>The</b> <b>whiskey</b> trade {{led to the}} Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent to stop the trade and establish order, arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.|$|E
5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion), and solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe to weaken the new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E

5|$|Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 {{criminal}} cases {{were brought in}} the circuit courts, and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 {{criminal cases}} were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in guilty verdicts by juries; 479, not guilty verdicts by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|E
5|$|In 1787, Washington Academy {{was officially}} chartered, and Thaddeus Dod {{was named the}} first {{principal}} on January 20, 1789, a position he held until July 1790. He was succeeded by David Johnson, who left for Canonsburg in July 1791. While the Washington Academy Board of Trustees still met {{during the period of}} unrest following <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Act and the subsequent Whiskey Rebellion, educational activities at the academy were essentially at a standstill. James Dobbins took control of the school between 1796 and 1801. Benjamin Mills followed, serving as principal from 1801 to 1805. In 1806, Matthew Brown began his term that would end later that year with the chartering of Washington College.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792, {{a second}} {{convention}} {{was held in}} Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret. A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As {{some of them had}} done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.|$|E

5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed <b>the</b> <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} <b>the</b> <b>whiskey</b> proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
