5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, <b>then</b> <b>something</b> greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E
25|$|The horse series also {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} the process was gradual, and that {{the origin of the}} modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, <b>then</b> <b>something</b> must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.|$|E

At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E

25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by <b>then</b> <b>something</b> of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But we can take it that the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E
25|$|Further {{construction}} {{involved the}} long tunnel, and inevitably the progress was slow. The rock was extremely hard and {{the height of}} the surface above the tunnel prevented the sinking of shafts, so that tunnelling could only proceed from the two ends. 1,100 men were engaged on the work, and compressed air drills, <b>then</b> <b>something</b> of a novelty, and blasting, were employed. The tunnel was finally ready in 1890, the open air section from Cymmer to Blaengwynfi opening on 2 June 1890, followed by opening through the tunnel to Blaengwynfi on 2 July 1890; the short connection from there to the junction with the Taff Vale Railway followed on 14 July 1890. The Rhondda Tunnel was the longest wholly in Wales, at 3,443 yards. The Taff Vale station at Treherbert was used as the terminal station, and from there a quarter mile of Taff Vale track was used to reach Blaenrhondda Junction (later R Junction), where the R itself started. A stiff climb followed to the mouth of the Rhondda Tunnel, and the climb continued in the tunnel, to the summit at the south-western end at Blaengwynfi. From there the line descended steeply.|$|E

[...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character.

[...] Conversely, a review by Simon Price for that publication's sister edition, The Independent on Sunday, gave the album their top score of five stars, saying that it [...] "features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals.

500|$|On 19 September, Groves went to Donald Nelson, the {{chairman}} of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President. Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944. According to Groves, [...] "In Washington you became {{aware of the importance of}} top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and <b>then</b> <b>something</b> else would get top priority".|$|E
500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And <b>then,</b> <b>something</b> happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E
