5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Confederate Memorial {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} restoration. The monument had darkened due to weathering. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the memorial were sanded and sealed for future protection. This restoration effort was funded through charitable contributions. The {{names of the}} contributors were inscribed within the same treasurer's book used to record the memorial's inaugural contributions on June6, 1866. The monument's restoration cost totaled $2,850 USD.|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E
50|$|Electron beam {{texturing}} (EBT) is {{a technology}} used to apply roughness to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> rolling mill cylinders by impinging <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> these cylinders with a modulated electron beam. The beam locally melts <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder, producing crater-like depressions.|$|R
40|$|A {{sharp edge}} is formed on an optical device {{by placing the}} optical device in a holding mechanism; {{grinding}} one surface so that it and a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism are co-planar; and polishing both <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism with felt until an edge on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism obtains a desired sharpness...|$|R
5000|$|Topography is {{the study}} and {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> features <b>of</b> land, which means it is <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth {{such as that of}} relief features which is whatever is on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> anything ...|$|R
5|$|The {{action of}} the {{magnetosphere}} traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth's Van Allen belts, but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and {{are affected by the}} motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous planetary ring system. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.|$|E
5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the stems or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E
5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E
500|$|Lake Vostok {{is located}} at the {{southern}} Pole of Cold, beneath Russia's Vostok Station under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is at [...] above mean sea level. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> this fresh water lake is approximately [...] under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice, which places it at approximately [...] below sea level.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasma {{membrane}} increases (by <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fused vesicle). This {{is important for}} the regulation of cell size, e.g., during cell growth.|$|R

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E

5000|$|In geology and geomorphology, {{the term}} [...] "patina" [...] {{is used to}} refer to {{discolored}} film or thin outer layer produced either on or within <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a rock or other material by either the development of a weathering rind within <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a rock, <b>the</b> formation of desert varnish on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a rock, or combination of both. It also refers to development as the result of weathering of a case-hardened layer, called [...] "cortex" [...] by geologists, within <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> either a flint or chert nodule.|$|R
5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The {{speed of the}} response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
40|$|An {{article is}} welded, as in weld repair of a defect, by {{positioning}} a weld lift-off block {{at a location}} on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article adjacent to the intended location {{of the end of}} the weldment on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. The weld lift-off block has a wedge shape including a base contacting <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article, and an upper face angled upwardly from the base from a base leading edge. A weld pool is formed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by directly heating <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article using a heat source. The heat source is moved relative to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article and onto <b>the</b> upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block by crossing the leading edge of the wedge, without discontinuing the direct heating of the article by the heat source. The heating of the article with the heat source is discontinued only after the heat source is directly heating the upper face of the weld lift-off block, and not the article...|$|R

50|$|With {{constant}} {{exposure to}} <b>the</b> sun, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice sheet continued to melt; the meltwater flowed from high {{points to the}} north- and south-east, and from the Niagara Escarpment to the west, into the cavity created by the fissure.

5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the microstructured plasma {{treatment of a}} film substrate, especially of a plastic film.

5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> their bodies and legs.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{scientists}} to describe and attempt to quantify the spreading of monolayer films on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a liquid was Benjamin Franklin. Franklin described the spreading of a drop <b>of</b> oil onto <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a lake to form a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> defined area. In addition he did experiments dropping oil onto <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a bowl of water and noted that the spreading action was dependent on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid, i.e. by increasing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid {{it will take more}} drops to create a film on <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Franklin suggested that this spreading action was based on repulsive forces between oil molecules.Much later this work was continued by Lord Rayleigh, who suggested that the spreading of oil on water resulted in a monolayer of oil molecules.|$|R
