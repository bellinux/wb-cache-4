30|$|High {{purity and}} {{analytical}} grade samples of TBP (AR[*]>[*] 98  %), toluene (AR[*]>[*] 99  %), HNO 3 (AR[*]>[*] 15.5  mol/L), and CeO 2 (AR[*]>[*] 99  %) procured from CDH chemicals {{were used as}} received. The binary mixture were prepared on percentage basis (w/w) by mixing known mass of toluene in appropriate masses of TBP and measuring their masses {{with the help of}} a high-precision electronic balance of (WENSAR, PGB 100, with accuracy ± 0.001  g). The densities of all mixture as well as pure liquid were measured by a specific gravity bottle calibrated with deionized double-distilled water of density 0.9960 [*]×[*] 103 kg/m 3 at 303.15  K. The precision of density measurement was within[*]±[*] 0.0001  kg/m 3. The ultrasonic velocity in the mixtures as well as in the component liquids were measured at 303.15  K (calibrated up to ± 0.01  m/s) by a single-crystal variable-path multifrequency ultrasonic interferometer operating at different frequencies 1 – 4  MHz (Mittal Enterprises, New Delhi, Model-M- 81 S). The temperature of the mixture was maintained constant within ± 0.01  K by circulation of water from <b>thermostatically</b> <b>regulated</b> constant temperature water bath (B- 206) through the water-jacketed cell. Viscosities of the mixtures were measured by Redwood apparatus (MAC, #RWV- 5271 was precise up to ± 0.0001  Nsm− 2).|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence spectroscopy. Stock {{solutions}} of {{wild type}} and LUSHF 121 A were diluted into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6. 5, and 2. 8 ml aliquots transferred into borosilicate glass tubes. Stock solutions of different concentrations of 11 -cis vaccenyl acetate (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) were prepared in 100 % DMSO. 2 ml {{of each of}} these stock solutions was then added to an aliquot of the protein to give a final DMSO concentration in each sample of 0. 083 % (v/v). Samples were equilibrated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 3 hours prior to data collection. Fluorescence experiments were performed on a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrometer using a stirred quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm in a <b>thermostatically</b> <b>regulated</b> cell holder at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and the emission was monitored over the range of 300 - 400 nm. Data were collected at 1 nm intervals with a 0. 5 second integration time. The band pass of both the emission and excitation monochromators was set to 4 nm. Data from three scans were averaged for each sample, and three independent experiments were performed for each complex. Data were corrected by subtraction of buffer containing VA, and were plotted as emission intensity at 340 nm vs [VA]. The resulting curves (9 for each complex) were fit simultaneously to the following equation to account for ligand depletion using Pris...|$|E
40|$|Thermosensitisation by {{step-down}} heating (SDH) {{has previously}} been demonstrated in experimental rodent tumours. The {{purpose of the study}} reported here was to investigate whether the SDH effect in tumours in part may be attributed to heat-induced alterations in the capillary network and/or the microenvironment. Two human melanoma xenograft lines differing substantially in vascular parameters were selected for the study. A <b>thermostatically</b> <b>regulated</b> water bath was used for heat treatment. The conditioning treatment (44. 5 degrees C or 45. 5 degrees C for 15 min) was given in vivo, whereas the test treatment (42. 0 degrees C for 45, 90, 135 or 180 min) was given either in vitro or in vivo. Treatment response was measured in vitro using a cell clonogenicity assay. Fraction of occluded vessels following heat treatment was assessed by examination of histological sections from tumours whose vascular network was filled with a contrast agent. Tumour bioenergetic status and tumour pH were measured by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The conditioning heat treatments caused significant vessel occlusion, decreased tumour bioenergetic status and decreased tumour pH in both tumour lines. The SDH effect measured when the test treatment was given in vivo was significantly increased relative to that measured when the test treatment was given in vitro. The magnitude of the increase showed a close relationship to fraction of occluded vessels, tumour bioenergetic status and tumour pH measured 90 min after treatment with 44. 5 degrees C or 45. 5 degrees C for 15 min. The increased SDH effect in vivo was probably attributable to tumour cells that were heat sensitive owing to the induction of low nutritional status and pH during the conditioning treatment. Consequently, the SDH effect in some tumours may in part be due to heat-induced alterations in the microenvironment. This suggests that SDH may be exploited clinically to achieve increased cell inactivation in tumours relative to the surrounding normal tissues...|$|E
