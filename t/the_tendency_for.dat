5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. <b>The</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. <b>The</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

He believed they create poverty and artificial scarcity while promoting privilege.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impedance}} test {{results of the}} steel reinforcement of various diameters, which was passivated and corroded in concrete specimens, were analysed. The impedance plots clearly indicated <b>the</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> spectra shapes of steel rebars to change depending on their diameters. A 3 -dimensional model of steel-concrete system was developed to explain the observed effect. This system was composed of the identical electrical equivalent circuits connected in parallel. Each equivalent scheme was characteristic for a theoretical conductive path during the measurement, which was defined between a counter-electrode and the reinforcement. This model was used with the rectangular counter electrode to simulate the formation of impedance spectra characteristic for a single reinforcing bar with the concrete cover of any thickness, a variable diameter and a variable polarization area. The simulation modelling the impact of various reinforcement diameters verified <b>the</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>for</b> impedance spectra of steel in concrete to change their shapes. The improved of fitting quality of the model spectra to the experimental ones were obtained by considering in that model the moisture content in concrete...|$|R
