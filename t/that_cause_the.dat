5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is a poorly understood disorder, {{and a number}} of theories have speculated the mechanisms <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no theory has gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
