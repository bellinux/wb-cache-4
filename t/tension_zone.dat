Many codes gave a minimum splice length for tension and compression reinforcement as a factor of the bar diameter depending on many parameters such as concrete strength, steel yield stress, shape of bar end, shape of bar surface and also bar location. Also, codes gave another restriction about the percentage of total reinforcement to be spliced at the same time. Comparatively limited attention has been directed toward the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and reinforcing bars spliced in <b>tension</b> <b>zones</b> in beams.

This research presents an experimental study on the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and reinforcing bars spliced in <b>tension</b> <b>zones</b> in beams.

50|$|In 1994, Dr. Srinivasan Chandrasekar, an {{engineering}} professor at Purdue University, and Dr. Munawar Chaudhri, Head of the Materials Group at the University of Cambridge, used high-speed framing photography {{to observe the}} drop-shattering process and concluded that while {{the surface of the}} drops experiences highly compressive stresses, the inside experience high tension forces, creating a state of unequal equilibrium which can easily be disturbed by breaking the tail. However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a Prince Rupert's drop. In a further study published in 2017 The team collaborated with Dr. Hillar Aben, a professor at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia using a transmission polariscope to measure the optical retardation of light from a red LED as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to , but that this surface compressive layer is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means {{that it is necessary to}} create a crack that enters the interior <b>tension</b> <b>zone</b> in order to break the droplet.

50|$|Hybrid {{zones and}} gene flow do not inevitably lead to merging {{of the two}} populations involved, and some hybrid zones may be {{retained}} for thousands of years. Some persistent hybrid zones are 'tension zones', where the conflicting effects of dispersal of parental forms and selection against hybrids balance each other. Dispersal of individual parents leads {{to the creation of}} more hybrids within the hybrid zone. This may result in gene flow between the two populations because of introgression. However, in the <b>tension</b> <b>zone</b> model hybrids are less fit than parental forms (perhaps because they lack the complete gene complexes of the parentals that make them well adapted to the environments either side of the hybrid zone), or even inviable or sterile. Inviability or sterility of hybrids forms a barrier to gene flow by making a 'hybrid sink' into which genes from parentals flow but rarely continue into the other population. Statistical models suggest that neutral alleles flow across this barrier very slowly while positively selected alleles will move across quite rapidly. An interesting outcome of this model is that tension zones are almost environment independent and can therefore move and empirical cases of this have been found.|$|E

This experimental research of effect of steel fibre (<b>tension</b> <b>zone)</b> in inhibiting flexural cracks in beam conducted focus on simply supported beam to determine the crack propagation incorporating steel fibre under flexural behaviour.

40|$|Genomic {{scans of}} {{multiple}} populations often reveal marker loci with greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic–environment association (GEA). GEAs imply {{a role for}} local adaptation, {{and so it is}} tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i. e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as <b>tension</b> <b>zones,</b> whose location can shift over time. However, <b>tension</b> <b>zones</b> have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i. e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches – even when these are correlated to environmental variables.
