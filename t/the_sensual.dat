5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between <b>the</b> <b>sensual</b> experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation.

25|$|Free-standing statues (three-dimensional depictions) {{are almost}} {{non-existent}} within the Orthodox Church.

Bas reliefs, however, became common during the Byzantine period and led to a tradition of covering a painted icon in a silver or gold 'riza' in order to preserve the icon.

25|$|During the 1950s, Color Field {{painting}} initially {{referred to}} {{a particular type of}} abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed <b>the</b> <b>sensual,</b> and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck {{in the face of an}} expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early to mid-1960s, Color Field painting came to refer to the styles of artists like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, and Helen Frankenthaler, whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like Larry Zox, and Frank Stella – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Larry Zox, and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In Mountains and Sea, from 1952, (see above) a seminal work of Colorfield painting by Helen Frankenthaler the artist used the stain technique for the first time.|$|E
25|$|In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life {{painting}} depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often {{arranged on}} a simple stone slab, and also a painting {{with one or more}} figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain {{in the second quarter of}} the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject <b>the</b> <b>sensual</b> pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, Vespertine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} both art and dance music. For example, the instrumentation of choir, strings, and harp is suggestive of Romantic art music, while the [...] "synthesised keyboard sonorities, filtering effects and complex percussive sounds" [...] are elements characteristic of dance-based pop. According to Nicola Dibben: ...the way in which classical and dance-based elements are made to sit alongside one another {{as part of the}} same texture mediates the relationship between the two: the spiritual and <b>the</b> <b>sensual</b> are shown to be compatible, perhaps even suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>sensual</b> is spiritual, and that it can facilitate transcendence and hence grant access to a utopian world. Vespertine is also characterized by [...] "the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology — that is, the pervasive use of loops, static and white noise— despite the obviously digital orientation of twenty-first-century electronics." [...] Unlike previous albums like Debut and Post, [...] "electronic sounds are the norm, and the acoustic sounds become the interjections." [...] Björk's voice is used as a supplement to [...] "the complex electronic textures". Her vocals often appear to be recorded close to the microphone and with little treatment, and sung in a sometimes [...] "unstable whisper", conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the intimate lyrics.|$|E
