40|$|When a <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> is {{irradiated}} on {{the surface}} of a material, the absorbed energy causes the heating, melting, and / or evaporation of the material depending on the absorbed laser power density. The general condition of laser welding process is to create a pool of molten material (weld pool) at the overlapping work piece surfaces. There are two general approaches for laser welding processes. In this paper, the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding is studied and Aluminum temperature field is gained in this process. The <b>thermal</b> effect of <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> that specially depends on the laser type and temperature field of it in work piece is the main key of analysis and optimization of this process, from which the main goal of this paper has been defined. Utilizing laser as a method to join plastic components is growing in popularity. There are two laser welding mechanisms, keyhole mode and conduction mode. Keyhole welding is widely used because it produces welds with high aspect ratios and narrow heat affected zones. However keyhole welding can be unstable, as the keyhole oscillates and closes intermittently. This intermittent closure causes porosity due to gas entrapment. Conduction welding, on the other hand, is more stable since vaporization is minimal and hence there is no further absorption {{below the surface of the}} material. Conduction welds are usually produced using low-power focused <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> This results in shallow welds with a low aspect ratio. In this work, high-power CO 2 and YAG lasers havebeen used to produce laser conduction welds on 2 mm and 3 mm gauge AA 5083 respectively by means of defocused beams. Full penetration butt-welds of and 3 mm gauges AA 508 using this process have been produced. It has been observed that in this regime the penetration depth increases initially up to a maximum and then decreases with increasing spot size...|$|R

30|$|The {{review of}} literarture reveals that hard {{computing}} based modeling, viz., {{finite element method}} (FEM) has limited applications due to difficulty in realistic modeling of laser beam-work surface interaction and unavailability of non-linear material properties at higher temperatures. Limited attempts have been reported on inverse computation of the unknown process and material parameters. Mishra and Dixit (2013) determined absorptivity, <b>thermal</b> diffusivity and <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> diameter by an inverse heat conduction method. They measured temperature at the centroid of bottom surface at different time intervals. The estimation of thermal properties from temperature measurements was constructed as a problem of minimization of the objective function with absorptivity, thermal diffusivity and beam diameter as decision variables. The implementation of inverse analysis provided good results. However, more than one combination of parameters provided same temperature variation with the time at a particular location. Therefore, Eideh and Dixit (2013) improved this model and carried out inverse determination by measuring temperature at two different locations. The objective was to minimize errors between predicted and measured temperature at two locations. The proposed methodology {{was found to be}} efficient and robust.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>thermal</b> {{annealing}} and <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> illumination {{on the structure}} of amorphous Se/CdSe multilayers of up to 20 periods and various sublayer thicknesses (3. 5, 5, 6. 5 and 10 nm) have been studied by measuring the higher frequency (vibrational) Raman spectra. Three Raman bands have been observed in this spectral region at 209 cm(- 1) (CdSe), 237 cm(- 1) (Se) and 256 cm(- 1) (Se). After annealing, the intensity of these bands increases for all amorphous multilayers (AML) samples which, in a fil st approach, indicates an improvement of interface quality. In AML of thin (5 nm) sublayers the opposite effect is concluded for Sr sublayers, and hardly any change for CdSe ones. A gradual increase of laser power density causes a likewise modification of Raman spectra, which is attributed to crystallization of Se sublayers; in similar low temperature (25 K) experiments (using even higher laser power densities) there is no indication of substantial crystallization, implying that the latter is mainly a thermal effect. From the threshold for crystallization, we observed that the structural stability of Se/CdSe AML is better, the smaller the sublayer thickness, an important result for electrophotographic applications.

This method is the cheapest one to obtain high alloyed coatings, {{because there is no}} need to apply complex technologies of powder making (metal powder is spread on the surface of base metal or inserted into the flux), it is enough to grind, granulate and blend additional materials. On the other hand, strengthening of superficial layers of alloys by <b>thermal</b> <b>laser</b> radiation is one of the applications of laser. Surface is strengthened by concentrated <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> focused into teeny area (from section of mm till some mm).
