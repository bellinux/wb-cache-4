In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E

Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth, exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E

500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to tell. When Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{presence}} of a passageway linking the Fulton Street complex and the Cortlandt Street BMT station, there is no free connection between the two stations.

2500|$|Some organisations {{have decided}} to hold outdoor demonstrations in Batam, Indonesia instead, to {{circumvent}} the ban in Singapore. About 1,000 delegates were planning to protest there for a week with a final outdoor demonstration on 18 September. The Indonesian laws state that {{they were allowed to}} protest on the streets, if they informed the authorities three days beforehand. The authorities were reportedly lukewarm towards their proposed demonstrations and forum. A number of Indonesian NGOs took a half-page advertisement in a Batam newspaper voicing their opposition to the protests, arguing that the big gathering of NGO's activists would [...] "undermine the investment climate on the island". On 6 September, the Batam police had {{sent a letter to the}} organisers that both their demonstration and forum would be banned. The police cited economic, political and security reasons for the ban, adding that other NGOs were not in favour of such protests. According to Indonesian officials, Batam police is helping to maintain the security during the meetings. Later, on 11 September, the Indonesian police granted a permit for a three-day protest forum in Batam, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be no outdoor demonstrations.|$|E
2500|$|Both lines 11 and 13–14 {{reference}} Gaius Asinius Pollio's leadership, but line 11 {{refers to}} his consulship {{at the time}} of the poem's writing, whereas lines 13–14 seem to reference a time when Pollio will [...] "still be alive and prominent in the State when the child is well-grown" [...] and when the Golden Age will have arrived. Lines 15–17 reveal that the child will become divine and eventually rule over the world. Lines 18–45 provide coverage of the boy's growth. At first, the child, in the cradle, will be allowed to enjoy munuscula, or little gifts. Importantly, the boy will grow skilled in reading, learning of the deeds of both heroes and his father. At this point in his life, the Golden Age will not have arrived in full; <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> be both sailing and walled towns, and thus, still war. Jenny Strauss Clay noted that the poem implies that the whole Heroic Age will have to be replayed; a new band of Argonauts will travel the seas, and a new Trojan War will occur. Given time, the need for sailing will dissipate. Then, the ground will grow more fertile: grapes will grow from brambles, oak trees will produce honey, corn will emerge from the ground by itself, poisonous plants and animals will disappear, and useful animals will be improved. Only when the need for agriculture ends will the Golden Age begin.|$|E
