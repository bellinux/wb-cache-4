25|$|Most {{of these}} viruses are {{transmitted}} by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick) and hence, classified as arboviruses. Human infections {{with most of}} these arboviruses are incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect the arthropods needed to continue the virus lifecycle– humans are then a dead end host. The exceptions to this are the yellow fever, dengue, and zika viruses. These three viruses still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although they continue to have important animal <b>transmission</b> <b>routes,</b> as well).|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} hypothesis {{about the}} epidemiology—the appearance, spread, and especially disappearance—of plague from Europe {{is that the}} flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The Black Rat (Rattus rattus) was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology. The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, herd immunity in that reservoir, interaction with human ecology, secondary <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> between humans with or without fleas, human herd immunity, and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its unexplained disappearance.|$|E
