5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Superdome</b> {{sustained}} significant damage, {{including two}} {{sections of the}} roof when waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off by wind. On August 30, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought shelter in <b>the</b> <b>Superdome.</b> They were then transported to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in <b>the</b> <b>Superdome</b> was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, <b>the</b> <b>Superdome</b> held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E

5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some {{of the success of the}} evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on <b>the</b> <b>Superdome</b> as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|By September 1, the facility, like <b>the</b> <b>Superdome,</b> was {{completely}} overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary.

Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen.

5|$|With {{the timber}} wolf being a species not native to Louisiana, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} {{as to what the}} relocated franchise would be called. Although never officially changed, some of the proposed names included: Rhythm from New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial and Angels from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. After speculation as to where the team would play their home games while a new arena was constructed, Superdome officials notified the league that enough dates would be available to schedule 41 home games at the dome for the 1994â€“95 season. Prior to this announcement, the team was rumored to play games at the Lakefront Arena, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge or the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi when <b>the</b> <b>Superdome</b> was unavailable.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at <b>the</b> <b>Superdome,</b> and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
