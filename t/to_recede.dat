Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began <b>to</b> <b>recede,</b> humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crossmodal dynamic visual capture {{occurs when the}} direction of motion of a visual cue causes a weakening or reversal of the perceived direction of motion of a concurrently presented auditory stimulus. It is known {{that there is a}} perceptual bias towards looming compared <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> stimuli, and faster bimodal reaction times have recently been observed for looming cues compared <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> cues (Cappe et al., 2009). The current studies aimed to test whether visual looming cues are associated with greater dynamic capture of auditory motion in depth compared <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> signals. Participants judged the direction of an auditory motion cue presented with a visual looming cue (expanding disk), a visual receding cue (contracting disk), or visual stationary cue (static disk). Visual cues were presented either simultaneously with the auditory cue, or after 500 ms. We found increased levels of interference with looming visual cues compared <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> visual cues, compared to asynchronous presentation or stationary visual cues. The results could not be explained by the weaker subjective strength of the receding auditory stimulus, as in Experiment 2 the looming and receding auditory cues were matched for perceived strength. These results show that dynamic visual capture of auditory motion in the depth plane is modulated by an adaptive bias for looming compared <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> visual cues...|$|R

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E
5|$|Flooding from Komen was {{worst in}} Rakhine State, where water {{distribution}} was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed. Waters started <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> by August4, allowing residents to return home; by September 2015, {{most of the}} displaced residents nationwide had returned home. High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was directly responsible for at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E

5|$|After the {{intersection}} with U.S. Route6, the surroundings around the highway become {{a mix of}} homes and forests. This lasts {{for much of the}} distance on Route434 until Greeley, where it becomes urbanized again. In downtown Greeley, Route434 splits at an intersection where Pennsylvania Route 590 begins. The highway makes a curve, turning to the southeast for a distance north of Greeley. Soon afterwards, Route434 parallels Shohola Creek, heading northeastward. Route434 begins to become urbanized for a third time, passing some large buildings along with homes and forests. The creek continues to parallel, with the highway turning in several different directions. The forests begin <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> as Route434 enters Shohola Township. Twin Lakes Road, a quadrant route, terminates at Route434 before crossing the Delaware River and becoming New York State Route 55 and Sullivan County Route 11 at the border.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River finally began <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> on 17 March; however, {{it took several}} weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|High water {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though {{the crest of}} the flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts. By early afternoon on the first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E

The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also {{predicted that the}} Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
40|$|Rotifers {{have often}} been used as {{indicators}} of sudden changes in physical and chemical features of the aquatic environment. Such features vary greatly during flood pulse events in small lakes connected to major floodplains. However, few are the studies that investigate {{the consequences of the}} flood pulse in rotifer species composition, abundance, richness and diversity, especially in Amazonian lakes. We analyzed samples from a small blackwater lake of an &# 8220;igarap&# 233;&# 8221; connected permanently to the Negro river, in Central Amazonia. Samples were taken twice a year for two years, comprising flooding and receding periods of the flood pulse. Rotifer abundance increased significantly after draught events, and electrical conductivity and turbidity were intrinsically related to such variation. Species composition also changed from flooding <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> periods. Some taxa, such as Brachionus zahniseri reductus and Lecane remanei were restricted <b>to</b> <b>receding</b> periods, while Brachionus zahniseri, Brachionus gillardi and Lecane proiecta were only present during flooding. A shift in the composition of rotifer families was observed from one period to another, showing the effect of renewing waters of the flood pulse. These results suggest that the flood pulse acts as a driving force and stressing condition, considerably altering rotifer community dynamics, either changing species composition or decreasing abundance...|$|R

5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began <b>to</b> <b>recede</b> in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E
