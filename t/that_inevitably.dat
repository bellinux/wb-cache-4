Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating <b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū began 2004 {{with two}} {{consecutive}} perfect 15–0 tournament wins (zensho-yūshō) in January and March. Nobody had attained a zensho-yūshō since 1996; yet Asashōryū {{went on to}} add three more such titles after 2004, for a career total of five. Only Hakuhō, with twelve, Taihō, with eight, and Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi with seven, have recorded more 15–0 scores. His unbeaten run continued into the first five days of the May 2004 tournament, giving him a winning streak of 35 bouts in total, the longest run since Chiyonofuji's 53 in 1988. Although he was then upset by maegashira Hokutōriki, he gained revenge by defeating Hokutōriki in a playoff {{on the final day}} to claim the championship. On 27 November 2004, Asashōryū became the first wrestler to win five tournaments in a year since Chiyonofuji achieved the feat in 1986, and won his ninth Emperor's Cup. Asashōryū's below average 9–6 score in the Autumn basho of 2004, the only one he did not win, was attributed in part to the official ceremony for his marriage, which was held in August 2004 (although he had actually married in December 2002). The hectic social round <b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> follows Japanese weddings affected his pre-tournament preparations, as it prevented him from doing any training.|$|E

25|$|Unlike utility {{ceramics}} {{found in}} such large numbers among {{the debris of}} archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was 'social currency' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.

On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration.

Previously, many developed treatment strategies (<b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments.|$|E
25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts <b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of qualia thus {{is governed by}} one's point of view, and <b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> brings with it philosophical and neurophysiological presuppositions. The question, therefore, of what qualia can be raises profound issues {{in the philosophy of}} mind, since some materialists want to deny their existence altogether: on the other hand, if they are accepted, they cannot be easily accounted for as they raise the difficult problem of consciousness. There are committed dualists such as Richard L. Amoroso or John Hagelin who believe that the mental and the material are two distinct aspects of physical reality like the distinction between the classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, there are direct realists for whom the thought of qualia is unscientific as {{there appears to be no}} way of making them fit within the modern scientific picture; and there are committed proselytizers for a final truth who reject them as forcing knowledge out of reach.|$|E

[...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where <b>that</b> <b>inevitably</b> stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there.
