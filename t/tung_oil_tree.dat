50|$|The {{collapse}} of the land boom in 1925-1926 had not been as severe in Gainesville as in southern Florida, but did cool off the local economy. As a result, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was not felt as strongly {{as in many other}} places. The city of Gainesville remained solvent throughout the Great Depression, and unemployment was lower than in most of the country. Agriculture continued to be a mainstay of the local economy. In 1922 tung trees were planted in Alachua County, and Gainesville became the center of <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> production in the United States. <b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> had previously been available only from China. Both <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>tung</b> <b>tree</b> seeds were shipped around the world from Gainesville. The University of Florida, with about 1,000 employees and 2,000 students, helped stabilize the local economy during the Depression. In the middle and late 1930s various New Deal programs brought money and employment to Gainesville. Utility lines were extended, streets paved and sidewalks installed. The Seagle Building was completed and occupied by the University of Florida. An airport, Gainesville's first, was built.|$|R

40|$|A <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tree</b> in full bloom. First {{cultivated}} in China, tung tree seeds or nuts produce an oil {{that has been}} an important ingredient in the manufacture of paint, oilcloth, hardwood board, caulking and other products. Large tung tree nurseries appeared in some states of the American South in the 1920 s as the pine lumber industry declined. North central Florida became the nation's largest area of Tung tree production, with Alachua County accounting for ninety percent of tung oil production in the 1930 s. During the 1930 s, Gainesville held an annual Tung Blossom Festival, where local young women competed for the title of "Tung Oil Queen.

Previously, {{we showed that}} two isoforms of the <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tree</b> [Vernicia (Aleurites) fordii] tail-anchored Cb 5 (cytochrome b 5) target specifically to ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membranes both in vivo and in vitro [Hwang, Pelitire, Henderson, Andrews, Dyer and Mullen (2004) Plant Cell 16, 3002 – 3019]. In the present study, we examine the targeting of various tung Cb 5 fusion proteins and truncation mutants to purified intracellular membranes in vitro {{in order to assess}} the importance of the charged CTS (C-terminal sequence) in targeting to specific membranes. Removal of the CTS from tung Cb 5 proteins resulted in efficient binding to both ER and mitochondria. Results from organelle competition, liposome-binding and membrane proteolysis experiments demonstrated that removal of the CTS results in spontaneous insertion of tung Cb 5 proteins into lipid bilayers. Our results indicate that the CTSs from plant Cb 5 proteins provide ER specificity by preventing spontaneous insertion into incorrect subcellular membranes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tree</b> (Vernicia fordii) is a {{promising}} industrial oil crop; however, this tree is highly susceptible to Fusarium wilt disease. Conversely, Vernicia montana is {{resistant to the}} pathogen. The APETALA 2 /ethylene-responsive element binding factor (AP 2 /ERF) transcription factor superfamily {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} resistance to Fusarium oxysporum. In this study, comprehensive analysis identified 75 and 81 putative Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF transcription factor-encoding genes in V. fordii and V. montana, respectively, which were divided into AP 2, ERF, related to ABI 3 and VP 1 (RAV) and Soloist families. After F. oxysporum infection, a majority of AP 2 /ERF superfamily genes showed strong patterns of repression in both V. fordii and V. montana. We then identified 53 pairs of one-to-one orthologs in V. fordii and V. montana, with most pairs of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression in response to the pathogen. Further investigation of Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF gene expression in plant tissues indicated that the pairs of genes with different expression patterns in response to F. oxysporum tended to exhibit different tissue profiles in the two species. In addition, VmAP 2 /ERF 036, showing the strongest interactions with 666 genes, was identified as a core hub gene mediating resistance. Moreover, qRT-PCR results indicated VmAP 2 /ERF 036 showed repressed expression while its orthologous gene VfAP 2 /ERF 036 had the opposite expression pattern during pathogen infection. Overall, comparative analysis of the Vf/VmAP 2 /ERF superfamily and indication of a potential hub resistance gene in resistant and susceptible Vernicia species provides valuable information for understanding the molecular basis and selection of essential functional genes for V. fordii genetic engineering to control Fusarium wilt disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of biodiesel production from <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> was investigated. The esterification {{reaction of the}} free fatty acids of <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> was performed using Amberlyst- 15. Optimal molar ratio of methanol to oil {{was determined to be}} 7. 5 : 1, and Amberlyst- 15 was 20. 8 wt% of oil by response surface methodology. Under these reaction conditions, the acid value of <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> was reduced to 0. 72 mg KOH/g. In the range of the molar equivalents of methanol to oil under 5, the esterification was strongly affected by the amount of methanol but not the catalyst. When the molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4. 1 : 1 and Amberlyst- 15 was 29. 8 wt% of the oil, the acid value decreased to 0. 85 mg KOH/g.

5000|$|<b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung <b>tree</b> (Vernicia fordii). <b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost wet look. Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make wrinkle finishes, usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed. Thus, to avoid the wrinkling, all <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> available for finishing today is [...] "boiled".|$|R

40|$|A <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> (TO) based monomer for rigid {{thermosetting}} polymer was synthesized, characterized, and copolymerized with styrene in this study. <b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> was alcoholyzed with pentaerythritol (PER) to get <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> pentaerythritol alcoholysis products (TOPER), and the optimized {{conditions were}} explored {{according to the}} yields of TOPER analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The resulting alcoholysis products were maleinated to form <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> maleate half ester (TOPERMA), and the reaction conditions were determined by monitoring the reaction extents of TOPER and maleic anhydride (MA) with 1 HNMR spectroscopy. The TO alcoholysis and maleinization reaction products were characterized by IR, 1 HNMR, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) techniques. At last, the TOPERMA mixture was cured with styrene (St), and the initiator tert-butyl peroxy benzoate (TPB). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to characterize the curing process. Mechanical properties of the cured TOPERMA/St resin further confirmed the best procedure for the maleinization reaction. The loading of TO reached about 30 % weight of the resulting thermosetting polymer.

5000|$|<b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> is {{very popular}} today because of 2 properties: First it is natural or [...] "green" [...] product when it has dried. Secondly, after it cures (5 to 30 days, weather/temperature related), {{the result is a}} very hard and easily {{repaired}} finish. This is why it is used on boat decks and now on floors. The oil is often diluted with hydrocarbon thinner so that the viscosity is very low and enables the oil to penetrate the finest grain woods. This thinning vehicle evaporates within 15 to 20 minutes and results in a totally green residual finish. As mentioned above, when applied in many fine/thinner coats over wood, <b>tung</b> <b>oil</b> slowly cures to a satin [...] "wetted wood" [...] look with slight golden tint. <b>Tung</b> <b>oil</b> resists liquid water better than any other pure oil finish and does not darken noticeably with age and is claimed to be less susceptible to mould than linseed oil.
