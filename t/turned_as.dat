5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages <b>turned</b> <b>as</b> the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian {{front was}} a {{separate}} theater of operations, which {{was involved in}} the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds. In addition, and again unlike Crete, the Venetians enjoyed the support of much of the local population, particularly the Morlacchi. The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some significant gains, including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres, and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment. The Ottomans were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split. In the next year however, the tide <b>turned,</b> <b>as</b> the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of Šibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area. As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.|$|E
5|$|The French {{attacked}} at 14:15, Minerve {{approaching the}} British line and opening {{fire on the}} central ship Ceylon. In the intervening time, the British battleline had become disorganised, with Astell {{too far to the}} rear to properly support the other ships. With the British line wavering, Minerve and Victor closed with the convoy and began to exchange fire with the three merchant ships in a general action, during which Robert Hay, captain of Astell was seriously wounded. At 16:00, Bouvet in Minerve pulled ahead of the struggling convoy and <b>turned</b> <b>as</b> if to ram and board Windham. Hoping to use the soldiers aboard to drive off the French ship, Captain Stewart turned to meet her. The damage done to Windham was however so severe that she was unable to make the turn correctly and Minerve passed just ahead of her, raking Windham and causing severe damage, the soldiers on Windham responding with musket fire.|$|E

25|$|Bret {{returned}} on the January 4, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, and promptly called out Michaels {{in order to}} bury the hatchet.

The pair shook hands and Michaels <b>turned</b> <b>as</b> if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, Hart has confirmed that it was indeed genuine, as did Michaels, and acknowledged that he felt that Michaels changed as a person, for the better. Later in the night, a storyline between Hart and McMahon began with the two appearing to have their own reconciliation only to have McMahon subsequently kick Hart in the gut: in real life, Hart and McMahon have been on slight speaking terms since 2002, when McMahon called Hart during his recovery from a stroke. The feud culminated in an encounter at WrestleMania 26, which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a match that involved the Hart family. After the match, Hart would continue to periodically work televised events for WWE.|$|E
25|$|The tour of Sri Lanka was Moores {{first tour}} overseas. The tour started with five ODI Internationals. Several new players were {{called up to}} the squad, {{including}} Phil Mustard and Graeme Swann. England were humbled in the first match, being bowled out for 150 chasing 270 {{to win the game}}. The following match saw the tables <b>turned</b> <b>as</b> England bowled Sri Lanka for out for 169 to win the game by 65 runs and level the series 1-1. Ryan Sidebottom, a player Moores had handed his debut to and integrated into the England squad, was the pick of the bowlers, with figures of 2-23. England then won the next match of the series which was badly affected by rain, resulting in the match being decided by the DL Method. The fourth ODI saw England complete a series win after winning the game by five wickets after chasing down 212 to win. Although England lost the final game by 107 runs after being bowled out for just 104, the 3-2 series win represented major progress for England, who had traditionally struggled on the sub-continent pitches. England had also gone into the series with a young team, including James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ravi Bopara, showing that Moores was successfully bringing through a new crop of England players.|$|E

25|$|Bermudians {{turned from}} their failed {{agricultural}} economy {{to the sea}} after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company. With a total landmass of , and lacking any natural resources, other than the Bermuda cedar, the colonists applied themselves fully to the maritime trades, developing the speedy Bermuda sloop, which was well suited both to commerce and to commerce raiding. Bermudian merchant vessels turned to privateering at every opportunity, during the 18th century, preying on the shipping of Spain, France and other nations during a series of wars. They typically left Bermuda with very large crews. This advantage in manpower was vital in seizing larger vessels, which themselves often lacked enough crewmembers {{to put up a}} strong defence. The extra crew men were also useful as prize crews for returning captured vessels. Despite close links to the American colonies (and the material aid provided the continental rebels {{in the form of a}} hundred barrels of stolen gunpowder), Bermudian privateers <b>turned</b> <b>as</b> aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbour to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels, which had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours. The only attack on Bermuda during the war was carried out by two sloops captained by a pair of Bermudian-born brothers (they damaged a fort and spiked its guns before retreating). It greatly surprised the Americans to discover that the crews of Bermudian privateers included Black slaves, as, with limited manpower, Bermuda had legislated that a part of all Bermudian crews must be made up of Blacks. In fact, when the Bermudian privateer Regulator was captured, virtually all of her crew were found to be Black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but all 70 elected to be treated as Prisoners of War. Sent to New York on the sloop Duxbury, they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda. The American War of 1812 was to be the encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s, due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits, and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians. During the course of the American War of 1812, Bermudian privateers were to capture 298 ships (the total captures by all British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies was 1,593 vessels).|$|E
