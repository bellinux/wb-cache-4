5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E

25|$|Labor {{performed}} by both slave and freed women was largely divided between domestic {{work and the}} market scene, which was much larger in urban cities like Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. The domestic work women performed for owners was traditional, consisting of cooking, cleaning, laundry, fetching water, and childcare. In the 1870s, 87–90% of slave women in Rio worked as domestic servants, and an estimated 34,000 slave and free women labored as domestics. Thus, Brazilian women in urban centers often blurred <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> separated the work and lives of the slave and the free.|$|E
25|$|After being {{subjected}} to heavy aerial and artillery bombardment, the following day the battalion's commanding officer, Arthur Boyes, handed over command to Lieutenant Colonel Roland Oakes, formerly the second {{in command of the}} 2/19th Battalion.

Shortly after taking up this appointment, however, Boyes was killed along with a number of his men when the battalion was ambushed while attempting to fill a gap in <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> had resulted from a Japanese breakthrough.|$|E
25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking {{in a sample of}} the mineral zinc blende, also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark {{in the center of each}} baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E
25|$|Once the Federal fleet {{had passed}} out of range, Louisiana had no further part in the action. Her fate was {{henceforth}} tied {{to that of the}} forts, which prepared for an expected attack by the Union army accompanying the fleet, led by Major General Benjamin Butler. However, on the night of 28 April, the enlisted men in Fort Jackson mutinied and forced the surrender of both forts to Commander Porter. The naval officers on Louisiana were not consulted {{at any time during the}} negotiations between Porter and General Duncan, so they considered themselves not bound to respect the truce declared by the two sides. While discussions of terms were going on, they decided not to let their ship fall into enemy hands. Louisiana was set afire, and her crew went ashore. The flames soon parted <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> held her to the bank, and she drifted down the river. When she was nearly abreast of Fort St. Philip, the fire reached her magazine, and she blew up with a blast that killed a soldier there.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was {{positioned}} near the Confederate right along a ridge; {{because of some}} swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill's front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from seeing any Union troops advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade's division routed two of Hill's brigades {{and part of a}} third. Hill required the assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division to repulse the Union attack. Hill's division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson's corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him about the gap left in the division's front line, saying that Hill had been warned about it before the battle but had done nothing to correct it. Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record of where he was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> he had been captured during the initial Union assault.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} {{first line}} was soon {{extended to the}} Place Saint-Hilaire, opening on 1 June 1878.

He also started steam traction from Darnétal (Line 2; started 23 June 1879). On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> went through narrow local streets remained horse-drawn when first opened: Line 4 (opened 3 October 1878), Line 5, (opening 12 December 1878), Line 6 (opened 6 February 1879), and Line 3 (opened 27 September 1879). Line 9 was not constructed because of technical difficulties.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson threw {{themselves}} around the ship's set. The camera's operator then shook the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves. The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more convincing. Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that he can hear her in the DVD shop, because he knew <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> appeared would have to play [...] "double duty later on" [...] and be authentic and fresh both times.

500|$|In Maulbetsch's defense, {{some writers}} noted the {{weakness}} of the Michigan line, often allowing rushers into the backfield before Maulbetsch even had the ball. [...] But some of those same observers noted that [...] "Mauly" [...] was not carrying the ball [...] "at his usual pace."

500|$|The casting for {{the episode}} was {{reportedly}} hectic.

Two real wrestlers, Gene LeBell and Rob Van Dam, were hired to play {{the parts of the}} bartender and Zupanic's opponent, respectively. Near the beginning of the episode, two FBI agents who bear a striking resemblance, in both physical appearance and voice, to Mulder and Scully appear. These characters were played by Steve Kiziak and Arlene Pileggi. Kiziak had previously served as David Duchovny's stunt double since the third season episode [...] "2Shy". Pileggi is the wife of Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner on the show. Duchovny and Anderson later dubbed their voices for <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> the two look-alike FBI agents say.|$|E

Other musical instruments used are foghorns and cow bells. In [...] "4 Minutes", Madonna and Timberlake sing and trade verses, the rhythm moves towards a hard clanging beat as Madonna sings <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "road to hell is paved with good intentions." [...] Madonna and Timberlake start singing the chorus with Timberlake singing the line of [...] "We've only got four minutes to save the world". The track continues in the same momentum in the second verse and second chorus whence the track ends where every beat ceases except for Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats, the brass riffs and Madonna singing the words [...] "tick-tock" [...] repeatedly, after which it ends.|$|E
