25|$|This {{mission was}} the second flight of the TriDAR, a 3D dual-sensing laser camera, {{intended}} for potential use as an autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor. TriDAR provides guidance {{information that can be}} used to guide a vehicle during rendezvous and docking operations in space. TriDAR does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft. To achieve this, it relies on a laser based 3D sensor and a <b>thermal</b> <b>imager.</b> Geometric information contained in successive 3D images is matched against the known shape of the target object to calculate its position and orientation in real-time. The TriDAR tracked the ISS position and orientation from the shuttle during docking, undocking, and flyaround operations.|$|E

TriDAR provides guidance {{information that can be}} used for rendezvous and docking operations in orbit, planetary landings and vehicle inspection/navigation of unmanned rovers.

25|$|The Air Force and Army {{will also}} use their Advanced Light {{helicopters}} (ALH) (HAL Dhruv) and the HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LHC) as Nag carriers.

The <b>thermal</b> <b>imager</b> is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.|$|E
25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC <b>thermal</b> <b>imager</b> which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E
50|$|A microbolometer is an {{uncooled}} thermal sensor. Previous {{high resolution}} thermal sensors required exotic and expensive cooling methods including stirling cycle coolers and liquid nitrogen coolers.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} recent applications by Sandia National Laboratories of cooled and uncooled <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>imagers</b> to wide-area {{security assessment}} systems. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imagers</b> can solve many security assessment {{problems associated with}} the protection of high-value assets at military bases, secure installations, and commercial facilities. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imagers</b> can provide surveillance video from security areas or perimeters both day and night without expensive security lighting. Until fairly recently, <b>thermal</b> <b>imagers</b> required open-loop cryogenic cooling to operate. The high cost of these systems and associated maintenance requirements restricted their widespread use. However, recent developments in reliable, closed-loop, linear drive cryogenic coolers and uncooled infrared imagers have dramatically reduced maintenance requirements, extended MTBF, and are leading to reduced system cost. These technology developments are resulting in greater availability and practicality for military as well as civilian security applications...|$|R
