5|$|Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was {{released}} November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in <b>the</b> <b>browser,</b> parental controls, {{and the ability}} to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.|$|E

Relative positioning means that the web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|Because it was {{frequently}} propagated through social media and broadcast on Twitch.tv and YouTube, Agar.io {{was a quick}} success. The agar.io website (for <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> version) was ranked by Alexa {{as one of the}} 1,000 most visited websites and the mobile versions were downloaded more than ten million times during their first week. During 2015, Agar.io was Google's most searched video game. It was Google's second-most searched game in the United States in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Beta-3a {{released}} on 14 August 1996 and Beta-3b {{released on}} 16 September 1996 introduced {{support for the}} Linux operating systems on m68k and DEC Alpha. CSS 1 support was enhanced and the internationalized version was also updated. Between the two beta-3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the Amaya browser. Beta-3 was the last involvement of the W3C {{in the development of}} Arena. On 17 February 1997, Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing <b>the</b> <b>browser.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development. Raggett demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft has {{integrated}} Cortana into numerous {{products such}} as Microsoft Edge, <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> bundled with Windows 10. Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into its Edge browser. Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather information in the address bar. At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming {{products such as}} GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E

5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. <b>The</b> <b>Browser</b> Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E
5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) testbed Web browser and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular {{at the beginning of}} the World Wide Web.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>browser</b> was forked from Galeon, after developers' {{disagreements}} about Galeon's growing complexity. Since then Web {{has been}} developed {{as part of the}} GNOME project and uses most of GNOME's technology and settings when applicable. It is part of the GNOME Core Applications. As required by the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), Web maintains a clean and simple graphical user interface with only a required minimum number of features exposed to users by default. The browser's functionality and configurability can be extended with official and third-party extensions.|$|E

5|$|The object element: The eyes also {{test support}} of the HTML object element. The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 it still was not completely supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important because it allows for content fallback—if an object fails to load, then <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E
5|$|Insomniac had {{exclusively}} developed {{games for}} the PlayStation console until in 2010 when Insomniac announced its partnership with Electronic Arts via EA Partners to develop a multi-platform game for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Studios' Xbox 360 console. The company hoped to reach a wider audience, while keeping the rights to its IP and retain full control of its franchises. The company revealed nothing about the game. The company established a new subsidiary called Insomniac Click, which focused on casual games and games for Facebook. Its first game was not set in any of Insomniac's existing franchises. Insomniac again partnered with Electronic Arts, which owned the popular casual game developer Playfish, to help the game to reach a broad audience. Outernauts was announced shortly after; it was released in July 2012 for browsers and mobile platforms. Click was later re-incorporated into Insomniac, and <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> version of Outernauts was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Previously, viewing YouTube {{videos on}} a {{personal}} computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in <b>the</b> <b>browser.</b> In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed. The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 video) or WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20, 2012 alongside Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix under the tentative title Kingdom Hearts for PC Browsers. Its official title was announced in February the following year. To promote the game, codes for special items and in-game currency were included with first-print copies of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix. A closed beta for the title began on March 22, 2013, with Beta recruitment beginning on March 13. The test was available for users who had a Yahoo Japan ID, and included in-game items and currency as a starting gift. An open beta test began on July 9, 2013, and the game's official service began on July 18 of the same year. Since the original release, the game received constant updates to its story missions, providing additional content to players. In April 2016, Square Enix announced that <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> game would be discontinued in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is {{to grow a}} cell on a petri dish by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. <b>The</b> <b>browser</b> version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of <b>the</b> <b>browser</b> market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
