25|$|The ignorance fallacy is {{sometimes}} confused (or combined) with logically valid contrapositive arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the <b>transposition</b> <b>rule</b> of inference in classical logic to conclude something like: To {{the extent that}} C implies E then Not-E must also imply Not-C. In other words, if a cause always leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet is assumed, then it can be assumed that if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets are not getting wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are logically equivalent.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} items are {{arranged}} in a line. At each unit of time one of the items is requested, the ith being requested with probability P,. We consider rules which reorder the items between successive requests in a fashion which depends only on the position in which the most recently requested item was found. It has been conjectured that the rule which always moves the requested item one closer {{to the front of}} the line minimizes the average position of the requested item. An example with six items shows that the conjecture is false. OPTIMAL LIST ORDER; MEMORY CONSTRAINTS; <b>TRANSPOSITION</b> <b>RULE</b> 1. A conjecture on optimal list ordering In modeling the storage of computer files, Rivest (1976) considered the problem of finding an optimal rule for self-ordering a line of items, e, [...] -, en. At each unit of time a request is made (independently of previous requests) to retrieve one of the items: the ith being requested with probability Pi, P,> 0, I P, = 1. The retrieval cost is equal to the position of the requested item in the line. Items may be reordered without cost between requests, but it is not possible to remember the frequencies with which the different items have been requested in the past. Therefore any reordering which is made between two successive requests, must be made using a no-memory rule which reorders the items in a fashion depending only on the position in which the most recently requested item was found. Rivest considered the <b>transposition</b> <b>rule</b> which transposes the requested item with the item which is one position closer {{to the front of the}} line. He showed that for all probability vectors P = (P, [...] -, Pn) the <b>transposition</b> <b>rule</b> has a smalle...|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} logic {{the reasoning}} process of <b>transposition</b> as a <b>rule</b> of inference {{is applied to}} categorical propositions through contraposition and obversion, a series of immediate inferences where the rule of obversion is first applied to the original categorical proposition [...] "All S is P"; yielding the obverse [...] "No S is non-P". In the obversion of the original proposition to an 'E' type proposition, both terms become distributed. The obverse is then converted, resulting in [...] "No non-P is S", maintaining distribution of both terms. The No non-P is S" [...] is again obverted, resulting in the contrapositive [...] "All non-P is non-S". Since nothing is said {{in the definition of}} contraposition with regard to the predicate of the inferred proposition, it is permissible that it could be the original subject or its contradictory, and the predicate term of the resulting 'A' type proposition is again undistributed. This results in two contrapositives, one where the predicate term is distributed, and another where the predicate term is undistributed.|$|R

40|$|A {{linear list}} is a {{collection}} of items that can be accessed sequentially. The cost of a request is the number of items that need to be examined before the desired item is located, i. e., the distance of the requested item {{from the beginning of the}} list. The <b>transposition</b> <b>rule</b> is one of the algorithms designed to reduce the search cost by organizing the list. In particular, upon a request for a given item, the item is transposed with the preceding one. We develop a new approach for analyzing the algorithm. The approach is based on a coupling with a certain constrained asymmetric exclusion process. This allows us to establish an asymptotic optimality of the rule for two families of request distributions. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{aspect of}} a {{parallel}} procedure for the numerical simulation of {{the solution of the}} Navier-Stokes equations through the Fourier-Galerkin pseudospectral method is presented. It consists of a dealiased (" 3 / 2 " <b>rule)</b> <b>transposition</b> of the data that organizes the computations in the distributed direction {{in such a way that}} whenever a Fast Fourier Transform must be calculated, the algorithm will employ data stored solely an the proper memory of the processor which is computing it. This provide for the employment of standard routines for the computations of the Fourier transform. The aliasing removal procedure has been directly inserted into the transposition algorithm. The code is written for distributed memory computers, but not specifically for a peculiar architecture. The use on a variety of machines is allowed by the adoption of the Message Passing Interface library. The portability of the code is demonstrated by the similar performances, in particular the high efficiency, that all the machines tested show up to a number of parallel processors equal to 1 / 2 the truncation parameter N/ 2. Explicit time integration is used. The present code organization is relevant to physical and mathematical problems which require a three dimensional spectral treatment...|$|R

To back it up, search the theoretical contribution of authors like Litwin (2001) and Pimenta (2004). As methodological resource, we used documental analysis, taking as source the Pedagogical Political Project of the course, Decree 5. 622 / 05 and 6. 303 / 07, which regulates Article 80 of the LDB, {{as well as}} the reports posted on the digital classroom by the students of Education from Simplicio Mendes City, in the years 2012 and 2013. After the analysis of the legislation, one notices that the supervised training distance education raises questions, namely: How effective is the supervised internship distance education? What are the internships scheduled for the pedagogy course DE/UFPI? Based on the initial findings, it was perceives that the effectiveness of the insternship occurred with the teaching practice, which is strengthened with the aid of technological resources. However, the mere <b>transposition</b> of the <b>rules</b> of the classroom stage, disregarding the specifics of distance education, can be detrimental to teacher formation process in the distance mode, so it is understood that the supervised internship training on distance education requires the creation of standards that address the specificities of the distance education model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This study pioneers {{a new way}} {{to study}} the {{performance}} of hashing algorithms by evaluating their queueing behavior. We examine hashing as applied to URL routing used in Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). URL routing tables can be built as self-adjusting hash tables to reduce network bandwidth consumption in CDNs {{and at the same time}} take advantage of the high temporal locality of Web document requests. We show through a trace-driven simulation that the existing Aggressive hashing (based on move-to-front rule) improves upon H 1 hashing (based on the <b>transposition</b> <b>rule).</b> Surprising results were found: even though the expected improvement in look-up time over H 1 hashing is modest, the improvement from a queueing perspective appears to be very significant. The long range dependence in look-up time of H 1 hashing contributes to its extreme queueing delay. This shows that using queueing delay as a means of evaluating hashing algorithms can be very insightful. Fig. 1 URL router forwarding or redirecting a request I...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} range of {{situations}} where non-state actors and states can possibly share responsibility for their contribution to harmful outcomes, thereby raising a multitude of questions on the determination, content and implementation of responsibility in such a scenario. It may be tempting to adopt an approach whereby a shared responsibility regime involving non-state actors and states draws ex post on the regime put {{in place by the}} ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, especially in connection to the rules of attribution of conduct and attribution of responsibility. Such a model of international responsibility, however, would only work to the extent that addressees are bound by primary norms of international law in the first place. This is certainly not a given in respect of non-state actors. Moreover, non-state actors may differ fundamentally from states, thereby making the <b>transposition</b> of traditional <b>rules</b> of state responsibility artificial and inadequate: their loosely organised, temporary, diverse, illegitimate, or even outright criminal character may militate against applying the classic responsibility paradigm to non-state-state interactions. In view of these limitations, a turn to an ex ante approach to questions of shared responsibility, through standard-setting, has been suggested, and may be cautiously supported in respect of the activities of a number of non-state actors. This, however, is not exclusive to the simultaneous application of ex post and ex ante approaches to shared responsibility...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} often-voiced {{concern that the}} {{expanding}} activities of international organizations lead to an 'accountability gap' {{in the sense that}} if potentially harmful activities are carried out through an international organization, neither the organization nor its member States can effectively be held to account. Many international organizations are only beginning to establish procedural remedies through which the lawfulness of their activities can be reviewed. In the absence of a direct remedy against the organization, third parties often try to hold the member States responsible in relation to the organization's activities. This thesis investigates under what circumstances member States can be held responsible for wrongful conduct taken within the framework of an international organization. It deals comprehensively with the attribution of conduct in multilateral contexts, with complicity as a ground of member State responsibility, with reparation for injuries committed by multiple responsible parties and with the judicial enforcement of member State responsibility. In doing so, it demonstrates how with the <b>transposition</b> of the <b>rules</b> on international responsibility to the context of international organizations, certain rules of State responsibility, well-established in an exclusively inter-State context, have been opened up to fundamental questions. The separate legal personality of international organizations can in fact be seen as creating an 'institutional veil' which makes it more difficult to 'see through' and hold States responsible for their conduct qua members. This thesis argues that the possibility of holding member States responsible for unlawful conduct taken within the framework of international organizations not only counters the risk that States could use them as vehicles to carry out unlawful acts, but that it also serves as an incentive for member States to create better procedural remedies against their international organizations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Competition law {{has always}} formed a core {{pillar of the}} European {{integration}} process {{and so it was}} among the crucial EU requirements set for the candidate countries. Competition law had a significant influence on the way competition laws and institutions were shaped in the candidate countries. In the pre-accession phase this was due to conditionality, however once conditionality terminates and candidate countries become Member States they fall under the EU law and its governance mechanisms, in competition law under Regulation 1 / 2003. While pre-accession <b>rule</b> <b>transposition</b> is well documented and closely monitored by the EU in its Regular Reports on the candidate countries, the EU’s internal governance mechanisms are less visible and have not been examined in the light of its external model that developed in the course of its eastward enlargement. In EU competition law such internal mechanisms have developed within the framework of Regulation 1 / 2003. These post-accession compliance mechanisms are critical both with regard to the effectiveness of the EU’s external governance and the internal system of Regulation 1 / 2003. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the interplay between the EU’s external (pre-accession) and internal (post-accession) governance model in the field of competition law and to arrive at a deeper understanding of the EU’s Europeanization strategy at the intersection of the external and internal governance models. Accordingly, the paper maps the EU’s external law and governance model that applies vis-à-vis third countries that wish to join the EU and examines to what extent and how this external model has shaped the EU’s internal governance model vis-à-vis its Member States. It analyses the role of Regulation 1 / 2003 in creating an effective implementation of EU competition law in the Member States and its governance mechanisms that framed the Europeanization process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of post-accession compliance in the Member States the paper examines the compound procedural framework composed of EU and national administrative rules that underlies and challenges the enforcement of EU competition law and investigates how administrative capacity of the national competition authorities may effect competition law enforcement. This inquiry includes the detailed assessment of the European Competition Network as the EU’s main mechanism to monitor compliance of Member States with EU law in the post-accession phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{elaborate}} EU and International Legislative framework and further perspective of Maritime law in the area of Safety protection. In recent years, the EU and its Member States have been at the forefront of improving safety legislation and promoting high-quality standards. The existing model of EU has a legal personality under International law. Previously, only the European Community had been granted legal personality (by Article 281 of the EC Treaty), while the legal personality of the EU was not regulated and thus remained disputed. Since its entry into force, the Treaty of Lisbon provides explicit legal personality for the EU [1]. EU’s action in the field of Maritime Safety regulation generates significant added value to the international framework as looked after by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The <b>transposition</b> of IMO <b>rules</b> into the EU legal system ensures their enforcement across the entire EU. In addition, the EU plays an important role on continuously improving international standards with specific dedication to the increasing of safety legislation. Generally, the EU Maritime Legislative framework is under International Institutional umbrella and strictly directed to the establishing of solid relations with various Institutions. The International law and Safety regulations of the sea control become matter of a high level concern for many states and related authorities. The concept of the International legal framework, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (UNCLOS), faces challenges of various numbers of unsettled issues and practices in order to satisfy current and increasing needs for ensuring safety at the sea. This paper elaborates some of the aspects towards globalization of Safety Regulatory Systems that achieved very serious collective concerns with large expanses of the sea. Having in mind this fact, as consequences of real threats, the lawmakers established various Legal instruments, well composed and structured known as Safety packages, (Erika 1, 2, 3). Additionally, the paper aims to provide a brief overview concerning unlawful activities have happened which have been resulted with high level of amended legal instruments. This means that the process of permanent legal upgrading is need to be done towards the essential objectives in order to prevent negative trends and particular increasing of safety protection through the EU and International Community. Globally, the area of Maritime safety issue becomes more common threat identified and therefore it needs urgent and permanent actions.
