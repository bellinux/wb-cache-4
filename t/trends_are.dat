Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements.|$|E
5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> {{also seen}} to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships.

5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
50|$|This {{concept of}} a <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the primary}} {{concepts}} in technical analysis. A <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> either up or down and for the complete neophyte observing a market, an upwards <b>trend</b> can <b>be</b> described simply as a period of time over which the price has moved up. An upwards <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> also known as a bull trend, or a rally. A bear trend or downwards trend or sell-off (or crash) is where the market moves downwards. The definition is as simple as the analysis is varied and complex. The assumption is of serial correlation, i.e. once in a <b>trend,</b> the market <b>is</b> likely to continue in that direction.|$|R

40|$|Background: Geographical {{differences}} in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) {{have been observed}} among Norwegian counties. Better long-term health status and higher physical activity (PA) levels have been documented in the county of Sogn & Fjordane compared with other counties. However, recent trends in CVD risk factors have not been documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the secular trends in leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and other CVD risk factors over a 35 -year period in a rural population of 40 - to 42 -year-olds in western Norway and to compare these trends with national trends. Methods: Data from eight cross-sectional studies from 1975 – 2010 (n = 375, 682) were obtained from questionnaires and physical examinations and were analyzed using mixed model regression analyses. Results: Decreasing <b>trends</b> <b>were</b> observed for sedentary behavior (for women), moderate PA, smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c) and total cholesterol (TC), whereas increasing <b>trends</b> <b>were</b> observed for body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), light PA, vigorous PA and sedentary behavior for men. Compared to the national trends, the trends in the 40 - 42 -year-olds from Sogn & Fjordane were more beneficial in terms of TG, HDL-c and BMI but less beneficial in terms of SBP and DBP. Conclusions: Over a 35 -year-period, this study indicates that the LTPA level has been relatively stable in the county of Sogn & Fjordane. Upward <b>trends</b> <b>were</b> observed in light and vigorous PA, whereas a downward <b>trend</b> <b>was</b> observed in moderate PA. For sedentary behavior, an upward <b>trend</b> <b>was</b> observed in men, whereas a downward <b>trend</b> <b>was</b> observed in women. For smoking, BP and cholesterol decreasing <b>trends</b> <b>were</b> found, but increasing <b>trends</b> <b>were</b> observed in BMI and TG. Compared with the national data, the trends in Sogn & Fjordane were more beneficial for TG, HDL-c and BMI but less beneficial for BP...|$|R
