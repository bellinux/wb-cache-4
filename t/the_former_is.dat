5|$|There are 34 known {{isotopes}} of francium {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 199 to 232. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 {{are the only}} isotopes that occur in nature, though <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> far more common.|$|E
5|$|Two {{protactinium}} oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic with ThO2 and {{the latter}} is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E

The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> an important indicator of culture {{but there is}} very little direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would certainly have been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources under a variety of different names.|$|E
5|$|Lord Tywin Lannister {{talks with}} his son Jaime while <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{skinning}} a stag, symbolic animal of the house Baratheon.

Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.|$|E

5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E

5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it is attached to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
5|$|The iron {{compounds}} {{produced on}} the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.|$|E
5|$|The main festivals celebrated at {{the temple}} include Navarathri and Sivarathri. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>is</b> a nine-day long festival in honour of the {{presiding}} Goddess, while the latter is an overnight observation in honour of Lord Shiva. In addition to these two Hindu festivals, the temple has a festival of its own, the Munneswaram festival, a four-week-long event attended by Hindus and Buddhists.|$|E
