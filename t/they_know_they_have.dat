25|$|In {{a typical}} class action, a {{plaintiff}} sues a defendant or {{a number of}} defendants {{on behalf of a}} group, or class, of absent parties. This differs from a traditional lawsuit, where one party sues another party for redress of a wrong, and all of the parties are present in court. Although standards differ between states and countries, class actions are most common where the allegations involve {{a large number of people}} (usually 40 or more) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way. Instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit, the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.|$|E

When they lie down on the bed, in the dark, Courtney discovers that she is lying on something, when Charlie turns on the light he finds Teddy lying dead on his bed with his pants around his knees, and lipstick on his [...] "Hoo Hoo". When Charlie tells Alan, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an even bigger problem: telling their mother. After pulling Evelyn away from the piano, they tell her and she then cashes in their honeymoon tickets for a trip for one to Fiji before calling the police.|$|E

50|$|The Europa League playoff {{groups were}} won by Oostende and Kortrijk, with Oostende {{overcoming}} Kortrijk on penalty kicks although <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{not been given}} a licence for European football.

"You {{may have}} {{the head of the}} catfish for the snuff, and the whole catfish for the box," [...] said La Certe, with the {{firmness}} {{of a man who has}} irrevocably made up his mind--for there are none so firm of purpose as the weak and vacillating when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> got the whip-hand of any one!

6000|$|Under the {{stimulation}} of their undying controversy Benham {{was driven to}} closer enquiries into Chinese thought. He tried particularly to get to mental grips with English-speaking Chinese. [...] "We still know nothing of China," [...] said Prothero. [...] "Most of the stuff {{we have been told}} about this country is mere middle-class tourists' twaddle. We send merchants from Brixton and missionaries from Glasgow, and what doesn't remind them of these delectable standards seems either funny to them or wicked. I admit the thing is slightly pot-bound, so to speak, in the ancient characters and the ancient traditions, but for all that, <b>they</b> <b>KNOW,</b> <b>they</b> <b>HAVE,</b> what {{all the rest of the}} world has still to find and get. When they begin to speak and write in a modern way and handle modern things and break into the soil they have scarcely touched, the rest of the world will find just how much it is behind.... Oh! not soldiering; the Chinese are not such fools as that, but LIFE...." ...|$|E

50|$|The final margin {{suggested}} a closer match than {{was actually the}} case. Waikato dominated {{for long periods of}} the game.

The first we should know of it would be the yell of the varmint at the foot of this barrier, and afore we could get to the top the two on guard would be tomahawked, and they would be down on us like a pack of wolves. I would a'most as soon put down my rifle and walk straight out now and let them shoot me, if I knew they would do it without any of their devilish tortures, as go on night after night, expecting to be woke up with their war-yell in my ears.|$|E

Nay, have you not seen this,--I have, thank God, full many a time,--That not many rich, not many mighty, not many noble are called: but that God's strength is rather made perfect in man's weakness,--that in foul garrets, in lonely sick-beds, in dark places of the earth, you find ignorant people, sickly people, ugly people, stupid people, in spite of, in defiance of, every opposing circumstance, leading heroic lives,--a blessing, a comfort, an example, a very Fount of Life to all around them; and dying heroic deaths, because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> Eternal Life? ...|$|E

They will palaver now; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> got us in a trap, and they will wait till night. Now, chief, I reckon that you and I and Hunting Dog had best stay here, so that if they try, as they are pretty sure to do, {{to find out whether}} we are here still, we can give them a hint to keep off. The other four had better ride {{straight}} down the cañon, and go on for a bit, to find out the best place for making a stand, and as soon as it is dark we will go forward and join them. There will be no occasion for us to hurry. I reckon the skunks will crawl up here soon after it is dark; but they won't go much farther, for we might hide up somewhere and they might miss us. In the morning they will come down on foot, sheltering behind the trees as much as they can, till at last they locate us." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{passing the}} wall of water the current did not change or flow {{backward}} any more but continued to sweep them steadily forward.

6000|$|... "Since {{the king}} of Portugal has ordered, that you shall be allowed from the {{treasury}} what is needful for your subsistence, {{make use of the}} favour of so charitable a prince, and receive nothing but from his ministers. If other persons will give you any thing, refuse it, though they should offer it of their own mere motion. For as much, as it is of great consequence to the liberty of an apostolical man, not to owe his subsistence to those whom he ought to conduct in the way of salvation, and whom he is bound to reprove, when they go astray from it; one may truly say of those presents, that he who takes, is taken. And it is for this, that when we are to make a charitable reprehension, to such of whom we receive alms, we know not well how to begin it, or in what words to dress it. Or if our zeal emboldens us to speak freely, our words have less effect upon them, because they treat us with an assuming air of loftiness, as if that which we received from them had made them our masters, and put them in possession of despising us. What I say, relates chiefly to a sort of persons, who are plunged in vice, who would willingly be credited with your friendship, and will endeavour by all good offices to make way to your good will. Their design is not to profit by your conversation, for the amendment of their lives; all they pretend to, is to stop your mouth, and to escape a censure, which <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> deserved. Be upon your guard against such people: yet I am not of opinion, that you should wholly reject them, or altogether despise their courtesy. If they should invite you to their table, refuse it not; and yet less refuse their presents of small value, such as are usually made in the Indies by the Portuguese to each other, and which one cannot refuse without giving an affront; as, for example, fruits and drinks. At the same time, declare to them, that you only receive those little gifts, in hope they will also receive your good advice; and that you go to eat with them, only that you may dispose them, by a good confession, to approach the holy table. For such presents as I have named, such I mean as are not to be refused, when you have received them, send them to the sick, to the prisoners, or to the poor. The people will be edified with this procedure, and no occasion left of suspecting you, either of niceness or covetousness.|$|E
