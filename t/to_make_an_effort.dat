25|$|In November 1988, Harbourside's lease was {{transferred}} to Luna Park Investments Pty Ltd. A year later, after no efforts {{had been made to}} repair and reopen Luna Park, and several submissions to replace most or all of the amusement park with high-rise apartment blocks and hotels, the New South Wales State Government issued an ultimatum to the company - open Luna Park by 1 June 1990, or lose the lease. Despite this ultimatum, Luna Park Investments did little to prepare the site. Rides were moved around, repainted, and renamed, to give the appearance that the new owners were trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort.</b> The directors kept putting forward excuses to try to gain an extension, even declaring a trade union ban on their own site. Four days after the government ultimatum passed, the lease was terminated and the Luna Park Reserve Trust was established. Soon after this, the National Heritage Trust added several buildings on the site to its list of protected structures.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to Sierra Leone in 1938 {{and established a}} number of labour unions, a newspaper and a political movement. He significantly raised membership for the WAYL and helped pioneer issue-oriented politics in Sierra Leone. The WAYL became the first political group <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> toward including the general population in the electoral process. Wallace-Johnson also campaigned for improved salaries and working conditions for workers, national unity and an increased civic role for women. Through the WAYL newspaper, the African Standard, he published a number of articles highly critical of top government officials. He was arrested on 1 September 1939 under the Emergency Act adopted {{at the start of}} World War II earlier that day. Wallace-Johnson was put on trial without a jury (who would have been sympathetic to his cause, as had been seen in previous cases against him) and received a 12-month prison sentence. He was held at Sherbro Island before being released in 1944. He {{returned to}} political activism, but found the WAYL in a state of disarray. He merged the league into the National Council of Sierra Leone and formed his own political parties during the 1950s, embracing Pan-Africanism and distancing himself from his earlier radicalism. He served as a delegate for Sierra Leone during independence talks in London in 1960. He died in a car crash in Ghana in May 1965.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Maud, the beautiful queen of Rumania, is deposed {{through the efforts of}} her wicked cousin, Rupert, who seizes the throne. He tries to make love to Maud, but when she spurns him he has her thrown into prison. Through the efforts of her faithful lady-in-waiting, and the kindly priest, the young queen escapes. While on a steamer, her cousin's spy locates her and decides to give her poison, but his attempt is detected by Jack Walton, wealthy young American who has seen the queen and fallen in love with her without knowing anything as to her history. A number of noblemen urge the queen <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to regain the throne, and when Jack joins his plea to theirs, she consents. But the queen is only in her country a few hours when she is arrested during the absence of Jack on a mission." ...|$|E

The latter two are smokers, and go on a cigarette break, which Rachel can't join as she doesn't smoke and she is angered to find that Nancy and Kim are busy making company decisions without her during the smoking break. Rachel fears for her position, as Kim and Nancy spend more time together during smoking breaks and have a better chance to bond, and thus Nancy is most probably going to get promotions. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> and bond with her co-workers, Rachel goes with them and smokes a cigarette. She is not enthusiastic to fall into the bad habit and tries to talk Kim and Nancy into quitting which comes to no avail, later catching them smoking behind her back. Kim warns Rachel that she would fire her if she catches her with a cigarette as she doesn't want to [...] "drag her down with them". She forces Rachel to leave, just as she invites Nancy to go on a business trip to Paris with her.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{first half}} {{is made up}} of EDM and [...] "syrupy" [...] Southern hip hop minimalism songs, which feature {{abrasive}} sound effects and eccentric beats. Like most of the album, they generally draw on dubstep, a bass-heavy subgenre typified by wobbly synthetic noises and blaring bass drops, as well as dance-pop and chopped and screwed sounds. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times characterizes the album's music as [...] "brutish and bruised" [...] with [...] "tough and layered" [...] production, citing David Guetta's [...] "guttural" [...] production on [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] and [...] "Right Now" [...] as an example. Music journalist Jude Rogers characterized the album's music as voluminous [...] "R", while Time magazine's Melissa Locker said that it has an [...] "urban R sound". According to Alexis Petridis, the different producers who worked on Unapologetic appeared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> away from Rihanna's previous [...] "pop-dance template... or at least to rearrange voguish sounds into less familiar shapes". Unapologetics ballad-oriented second half incorporates disco, reggae, and rock styles. According to music critic Greg Kot, Unapologetic is [...] "ostensibly" [...] a pop album, while Vibe said that it is [...] "on the surface" [...] an assortment of genres such as R, dubstep and pop.|$|E
2500|$|The hostility {{between the}} Albertines and the Ernestines gave Augustus serious trouble. A preacher named Matthias Flacius held an {{influential}} position in ducal Saxony, and taught {{a form of}} Lutheranism different from that taught in the Electorate of Saxony. This breach was widened when Flacius began to make personal attacks on Augustus, to prophesy his speedy downfall, and to incite Duke John Frederick <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to recover his rightful position. Associated with Flacius was a knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, who, not satisfied with words only, made inroads into the Electorate of Saxony and sought the aid of foreign powers in his plan to depose Augustus. After some delay Grumbach and his protector, John Frederick, were placed under the imperial ban, and Augustus was entrusted with its execution. His campaign in 1567 was short and successful. John Frederick surrendered, and passed his time in prison {{until his death in}} 1595; Grumbach was taken and executed; and the position of the elector was made quite secure. The form of Lutheranism taught in the Electorate of Saxony was that of Melanchthon, and many of its teachers and adherents, such as Caspar Peucer and Johann Stössel, afterwards called Crypto-Calvinists, were favoured by the elector.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E
2500|$|For example, let {{the flat}} rate be 20%, {{and let the}} {{deductions}} be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. Under such a system, {{a family of four}} making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 × (74,000 − 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions. Families of four earning less than $54,000 per year, however, would experience a [...] "negative" [...] amount of tax (that is, the family would receive money from the government instead of paying to the government). For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. The NIT is intended to replace not just the USA's income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as food stamps and Medicaid. The NIT is designed to avoid the welfare trap—effective high marginal tax rates arising from the rules reducing benefits as market income rises. An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement. Those who would owe negative tax would be receiving a form of welfare without having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to obtain employment. Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the working poor.|$|E

[...] Wang, seeing that Gao, while serving as titular supreme commander, was taking no actions against Huang, again offered to oversee the operations against Huang. [...] In spring 882, Wang was made the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and the supreme commander of the imperial forces {{as well as the}} director of taxation. [...] The general Cui Anqian was made his deputy. [...] Wang was also apparently given the authority to issue edicts in Emperor Xizong's name, and thereafter frequently did so as part of the operations. [...] Wang also soon led the armies of Xichuan, Dongchuan (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), and Shannan West (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) forces and approached Chang'an, rendezvousing with other Tang imperial generals to encircle the Chang'an region, intending to recapture it. [...] With the Tang imperial forces converging, one of Huang's key followers, Zhu Wen, then defending Tong Prefecture (同州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), surrendered to Tang, and Wang commissioned him as the military governor of Tonghua (同華, headquartered at Tong Prefecture). [...] Meanwhile, under the suggestion of the eunuch monitor of the army, Yang Fuguang, Wang also issued an edict pardoning the Shatuo chieftain Li Keyong, who had rebelled against Tang authorities prior, and commissioning Li Keyong to attack Huang's Qi state. [...] Li Keyong accepted the commission and joined the campaign against Huang. [...] Wang also issued an order to Zheng Congdang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), who had not previously permitted Li Keyong to pass through his circuit, to allow Li Keyong to pass.|$|E
