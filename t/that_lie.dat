5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{has many}} areas of {{wildlife}} <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> in both informal settings such as the Project Kingfisher and Woodgate Valley Country Park and in a selection of parks such as Lickey Hills Country Park, Handsworth Park, Kings Heath Park, and Cannon Hill Park, the latter also housing the Birmingham Nature Centre.|$|E
5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> entirely on such a surface.|$|E

5|$|In his journalism career Lie {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} yellow press tactics used by his contemporaries and preferred to avoid extensive polemics in the press. Malaysian journalism historian Ahmat Adam, writing in 1995, notes that Lie's entry into the press sparked a wave of peranakan Chinese writers to become newspaper editors, and Sumardjo suggests <b>that</b> <b>Lie</b> remained best known to native Indonesians through {{his work in the}} press.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> {{between the}} layers of the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
5|$|Some sponges also secrete exoskeletons <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> {{completely}} {{outside their}} organic components. For example, sclerosponges ("hard sponges") have massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons {{over which the}} organic matter forms a thin layer with choanocyte chambers in pits in the mineral. These exoskeletons are secreted by the pinacocytes that form the animals' skins.|$|E

5|$|The NGC 2841 {{group is}} a group of galaxies <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> both in Lynx and {{neighbouring}} Ursa Major. It includes the loose triplet NGC 2541, NGC 2500, and NGC 2552 within Lynx. Using cepheids of NGC 2541 as standard candles, the distance to that galaxy (and the group) has been estimated at around 40 million light–years. NGC 2841 itself lies in Ursa Major.|$|E
5|$|The {{polynomial}} Euclidean algorithm {{has other}} applications, such as Sturm chains, {{a method for}} counting the zeros of a polynomial <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> inside a given real interval. This in turn has applications in several areas, such as the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion in control theory.|$|E
5|$|Although both Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari {{were often}} {{performed}} on stage, {{the similarities between}} the two were not discovered for several years. Zaini-Lajoubert writes that Tio Ie Soei uncovered these similarities while working as a journalist for the Chinese Malay newspaper Lay Po in 1923. Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote that none of his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated <b>that</b> <b>Lie</b> had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.|$|E

'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} nocturnal migrants. Most corn crakes migrate through Egypt, with smaller numbers {{crossing}} {{at the western}} end of the Mediterranean. It has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of west Africa, and those parts of southern Asia <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further afield, it has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, the Seychelles, Bermuda, Canada, the United States, Greenland, and the North Atlantic islands.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
50|$|The term Villgraten Mountains is also {{historically}} and formally correct in {{referring to the}} entire mountain chain between the Hochstein east of Lienz and the Staller Saddle.

5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the fictional}} continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines {{and a large}} {{ensemble}} cast but centers on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting {{a return to the}} throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars <b>that</b> <b>lie</b> in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E
