Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In 2014, {{developing}} countries {{were responsible for}} 56. 5 % of total value of seafood imported by the EU; however, their import value only grew 56 % relative to 1999. During the same period, China, gained over 300 % growth in this market. The EU’s General System of Preferences (GSP) scheme provides duty-free or duty-reduction <b>tariff</b> <b>treatments</b> for certain products from {{developing countries}}. In December 2005, the EU decided to further grand the GSP-plus incentives to vulnerable developing countries, which may enter the EU market with an extension of duty-free access. The EU’s new GSP regime started to apply on 1 January 2014. However, China was removed from GSP benefits as from 1 January 2015. This paper explores {{the impact of the}} EU GSP scheme and Chinese products on other developing countries in the EU seafood market. In particular, we aim to identify the observed trade patterns in terms of trade duration. Estimation results from the survival function indicate that (1) the lower growth rate of seafood imports from developing countries may relate to the lower probability of those products remaining in the market, and (2) while products from the GSP-plus beneficiaries experienced high risk of leaving the market, the product lines competing with Chinese products are expected to have a longer duration. We further estimate the Cox model to assess the determinants of the hazard rate at which trade duration is terminated. Results indicate that a lower price of substitutes relative to Chinese products can reduce the hazard, with a factor of 17 %...|$|R

Often {{referred to as}} the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Amended several times, the last substantive revisions were made in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382, Title II, August 20, 1990). This made trade benefits permanent (repealing the September 30, 1995 termination date). The law gives preferential trade and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free entry of eligible products. To be eligible, an article must be a product of a beneficiary country and imported directly from it, and at least 35% of its import value must have originated in one or more CBERA beneficiaries. Slightly different import value rules apply to articles entering from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The duty-free import of sugar and beef products is subject to a special eligibility requirement intended to ensure that increased production of sugar and beef will not adversely affect overall food production. Preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>treatment</b> does not extend to imports of: textiles and apparel subject to textile agreements, specified footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and its products, and watches or watch parts containing any material originating in countries denied normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) trade status.

40|$|Introduction: {{the impact}} of {{cervical}} cancer prevention, in particular through HPV female vaccination, has been published for many countries at the national level. However, to our knowledge no attempt {{has been made to}} address the impact at a regional level. Since the Italian health reforms of the early 1990 s, introducing “managerialism”, decentralization and quasi-market mechanisms, regional authorities have consequently been experimenting with different organizational and funding models to achieve an acceptable combination of equity, efficiency, freedom of choice and cost-containment. Methods: a Markov model, previously described and successfully adapted to the national scenario [La Torre, 2007], has been used to explore {{the impact of}} preventive cervical cancer vaccination with Cervarix™ at a regional level in Italy. Resource use was based on a standard therapeutic path applied to all regions. However we quantified the impact of the so-called “decentralization progress” by collecting regional data on: pap-test coverage, <b>tariffs</b> for <b>treatments</b> and cost of the vaccination course. We performed for each Italian region a cost-effectiveness analysis combined with a regional budget impact analysis. The regional analyses compared HPV vaccination, both of a single female cohort (12 years old) and a multiple female cohort (12 + 16 years old), plus screening to screening only. Results: 21 regional reports were produced presenting regional results on screening coverage, treatments costs, ICER and ICUR, net cost per subject vaccinated etc. Conclusions: national and regional analyses have two different aims: the former wants to address national regulatory agencies and needs to be representative of the national population whereas the latter deals with the real budget-holders, accountable in the eyes of patients. Furthermore in the Italian scenario, characterized by decentralization and local autonomy, a further level of detail is essential in order to describe the specific local settings and implications of a new health intervention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn many {{countries}} healthcare commissioning bodies (state or insurance-based) reimburse hospitals for their activity. The {{costs associated with}} post-graduate clinical training {{as part of this}} are poorly understood. This study quantified the financial revenue generated by surgical trainees in the out-patient clinic setting. MethodsA retrospective analysis of surgical out-patient ambulatory care appointments under 6 full-time equivalent Consultants (Attendings) in one hospital over 2 months. Clinic attendance lists were generated from the Patient Access System. Appointments were categorised as: ‘new’, ‘review’ or ‘procedure’ as per the Department of Health Payment by Results (PbR) Outpatient <b>Tariff</b> (Outpatient <b>Treatment</b> Function Code 104; Outpatient Procedure Code OPRSI 1). ResultsDuring the study period 78 clinics offered 1184 appointments; 133 of these were not attended (11. 2 %). Of those attended 1029 had sufficient detail for analysis (98 %). 261 (25. 4 %) patients were seen by a trainee. Applying PbR reimbursement criteria to these gave a projected annual income of £GBP 218, 712 (€EU 266, 527; $USD 353, 657) generated by 6 surgical trainees (Residents). This is equivalent to approximately £GBP 36, 452 (€EU 44, 415; $USD 58, 943) per trainee annually compared to £GBP 48, 732 (€EU 59, 378; $USD 78, 800) per Consultant. This projected yearly income off-set 95 % of the trainee's basic salary. ConclusionSurgical trainees generated a quarter of the out-patient clinic activity related income in this study, with each trainee producing three-quarters of that generated by a Consultant. This offers considerable commercial value to hospitals. Although this must offset productivity differences and overall running costs, training bodies should ensure hospitals offer an appropriate return. In a competitive market hospitals could be invited to compete for trainees, with preference given to those providing excellence in training...|$|R

In 1888, {{he took out a}} loan of three-quarters of a million pounds sterling from the Amsterdam banking house Westendorp. The Westendorp Company went bankrupt in 1892, after its agent revealed fraud in the Customs Service, where Heureaux arranged preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>treatment</b> for some of his domestic creditors. A consortium of New York businessmen calling themselves the San Domingo Improvement Co. bought out Westendorp, taking over the claims of its European bondholders, in exchange for two loans, one of $1.2 million and the other of £2 million, to fund the countries external debt, to be secured with a lien over the nations customs fees. As the mounting public debt made it impossible to maintain his political machine, Heureaux increasingly relied on secret loans from the San Domingo Improvement Co., sugar planters and local merchants. In 1897, with the country on the brink of bankruptcy, Lilís was reduced to printing five million dollars worth of unsecured paper money, known as papaletas de Lilís, ruining many of the countries merchants. This helped trigger a new revolt among the Cibaeño tobacco planters and merchants, leading to his assassination in Moca in July 1899. By the time of his death, the national debt exceeded $35 million, fifteen times the annual budget. [...] During his time in office, the country's economy came largely {{under the control of the}} United States.

The growth of trade was spurred in 1980 when the U. S. extended the Most-Favored-Nation <b>Tariff</b> Preference <b>Treatment</b> (MFN) to China on February 1, 1980. After nearly a decade of experience operating within this regime, the "Tiananmen Square" event of 1989 and its ramifications have led some U. S. Congresspersons to call {{for an end to the}} MFN treatment. Former president George Bush resisted these calls and President Clinton has agreed to renew the MFN treatment for another year without any conditions creating a political debate that has transpired with little knowledge of how important MFN treatment is to China and to the U. S. This study empirically estimates the economic importance of U. S. -China MFN treatment thereby providing substance upon which policy discussions and decisions can be based. In pursuit of my goal of empirically establishing the results of the U. S. 's MFN treatment of imports from China, this study has three technical objectives: First, since both import demand and export supply influences determine equilibrium price and quantity, based on the paper by Mendez and Rousslang (1989), simultaneous equation estimating methods have been used when dealing with the "simultaneity" problem that has plagued previous similar studies. Second, based on the fact that sales of imported goods are sensitive to price, disaggregated elasticities of the U. S. import demand for Chinese goods and of China's export supply to the U. S. are estimated by using Edward Leamer' s method (1981). This enables me to avoid "the errors in observation" that have distorted previous, similar studies for other country's trade. Third, instead of focusing on only one country, the estimated elasticities have been used to assess the welfare effects of implementing MFN treatment for both the U. S. and China. In conclusion, these results are analyzed to provide both other scholars and policymakers a better understanding of the costs of terminating MFN treatment of China's exports...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To use the {{population}} attributable risk (PAR) {{to estimate the}} treatment costs resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -induced gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity. Design: Two case-control studies with the following outcomes: (i) the start of therapy with gastroprotective agents (GPAs) and (ii) hospitalisations for GI events. Setting: Community-dwelling inhabitants of defined areas in The Netherlands covering the period 1989 to 1998. All analyses were performed {{from the perspective of}} a third-party payer. Methods: Risk and exposure data were obtained from the Dutch PHARMO system, a population-based register of drug-dispensing records and hospital records. The PAR was estimated based on stratum-specific prevalence estimates of NSAID use and the corresponding odds ratios (ORs) obtained from the case-control studies. Cost data were obtained from Dutch national hospital discharge records and <b>tariffs.</b> Annual <b>treatment</b> costs of NSAID-induced GI events were calculated based on the PAR in the sample population and extrapolated to the total population using national demographic data. Results: The adjusted ORs for starting GPA use and hospitalisation for GI events were 6. 6 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 5. 5 to 7. 8] and 5. 0 (95 % CI: 4. 0 to 6. 2), respectively, in NSAID users compared with controls. Variation of OR with age among NSAID users suggested that prevention of GI events is most efficient among the elderly. The total annual cost (1998 values) of GPA use and hospitalisations for GI events attributable to the use of NSAIDs was 59 million euro (EUR) [95 % CI: EUR 38. 5 million to EUR 98 million]. More than 65 % of these NSAID-induced costs, EUR 38 million, can be attributed to long term users of NSAIDs, representing only 9. 3 % of all users of NSAIDs. Conclusions: The PAR can be used to estimate the costs of drug-induced morbidity and changes in costs resulting from substitutions with other drugs. For each EUR 1. 00 spent on NSAIDs, an additional EUR 0. 68 (excluding costs for prophylactic treatment) can be added for the treatment of GI adverse events.

40|$|The {{multilateral}} {{trade regime}} remains very attractive to existing and prospective members. The WTO provides {{a set of}} rules, safeguards, and various mechanisms {{for the conduct of}} international trade in goods and services. It is even more useful for small countries, for which multilateral, rule-bound negotiations would be much preferable to bilateral negotiations in which bigger countries would have the upper hand. One of the most important principles of the WTO is non-discrimination principle, and those principles include: the principle of most-favored nation (MFN principle) and principle of national treatment. These principles are also the core principles of the multilateral system in all agreements within the WTO. “MFN” treatment requires Members to accord the most favorable <b>tariff</b> and regulatory <b>treatment</b> given to the product of any one Member at the time of import or export of "like products" of all other Members, is one of the bedrock principles of the WTO.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was the primary outcome measure of cost-effectiveness, comparing both treatment strategies. Results: The mean total opportunity costs were € 981 (95 % CI € 971 -€ 991) for the RPD treatment and € 2. 480 (95 % CI € 2. 461 -€ 2. 500) for the ISRPD treatment. The total costs derived from the national tariff structure were € 850 for the RPD treatment and € 2. 610 for the ISRPD treatment. The ICER for OHIP-NL 49 and MAI using the opportunity costs was € 80 and € 786, respectively. When using the tariff structure, corresponding ICERs were € 94 and € 921. The effect of supporting an RPD with implants when expressed in QALYs was negligible; hence an ICER was not determined. Conclusions: It is concluded that depending on the choice of outcome measure and monetary threshold, supporting an RPD with implants is cost-effective when payers are willing to pay more than € 80 per OHIP point gained. Per MAI point gained, an additional € 786 has to be invested...|$|R
40|$|Preferential trade {{agreements}} (PTAs) in the Asia-Pacific region have proliferated rapidly {{over the past}} five years and are creating a complex web of intersecting bilateral and regional {{trade agreements}}. This paper describes the proliferation of these PTAs, discusses their characteristics and implementation, and assesses their potential effects. Realizing the potential gains from Asia-Pacific PTAs requires a commitment to liberalize sensitive sectors, to maintain consistent provisions, and to enforce agreements. Other factors, including administrative complications, also could undermine any potential gains.
