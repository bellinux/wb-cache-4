5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism.

Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

The cost-minimal solution that most DCOP algorithms look for might not be desirable in dynamically changing environments where agents are committed to an existing solution. In such situations, {{it might be more}} desirable to find either (a) a cost-minimal solution where at most k agents need to break <b>their</b> <b>commitments,</b> where k is a user-defined constant; or (b) any solution within a user-defined error bound that minimizes the number of agents that need to break <b>their</b> <b>commitments.</b> Limited discrepancy search searches for solutions in the order of increasing number of discrepancies, i. e. number of agents that need to break <b>their</b> <b>commitments,</b> and is thus ideally suited for finding the two types of solutions mentioned above. We describe how one can transform a DCOP algorithm that employs depth-first branch-and-bound to employ limited discrepancy search and, as an example, transform BnB-ADOPT to Limited Discrepancy Search ADOPT...|$|R
5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste of things to come. When the Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening <b>their</b> <b>commitment</b> to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{constituent}} groups were the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS {{was responsible for}} enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for <b>their</b> <b>commitment</b> to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.|$|E

The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo to ensure that the Yugoslavs were abiding by <b>their</b> <b>commitment</b> to withdraw thousands of soldier and police officers from the province.

5|$|In late 1944, the Australian Army {{had assumed}} {{responsibility}} for Allied operations on Bougainville, replacing US troops who were subsequently redeployed to the Philippines. At the time, the Australians {{believed that there}} were only 17,500 Japanese on the island, although in reality it was actually more than 40,000. Against this, the Australians deployed Lieutenant General Stanley Savige's II Corps, consisting of the 3rd Division and the 11th Brigade in November 1944. The troops were Militiamen, part of Australia's reserve military, consisting of volunteers and conscripts. Although their ranks included some Second Australian Imperial Force soldiers and officers who were veterans of earlier campaigns in the Middle East and New Guinea, they were largely inexperienced having served primarily in a garrison role in Australia and New Guinea prior to <b>their</b> <b>commitment</b> to Bougainville. In December, {{after a period of}} reconnaissance and information gathering, it was decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville.|$|E

With Thi the only non-supporter, Ká»³ and his colleagues removed Thi from the junta and his corps command on 10 March 1966. Thi claimed that during this meeting, knowing the other generals' antipathy to him, he nettled them by chastising <b>their</b> <b>commitment</b> to the country. He said the populace would never support the generals' war effort {{as long as they}} lived so comfortably, and he mocked them for ostentatiously flying their wives and mistresses to Hong Kong for shopping expeditions.
