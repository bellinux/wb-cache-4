2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} does not rest on knowledge or {{intent of the}} defendant. The act constituting [...] "conversion" [...] must be an intentional act, but does not require wrongful intent, and is not excused by care, good faith, or lack of knowledge. Fraudulent intent is not an element of conversion. The defendant is answerable for the conversion, {{no matter how good}} his intentions were, or how careful he has been, or how apparently well-founded was his belief that his <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> was right. The existence of probable cause does not preclude liability. A person may be liable for conversion even though he was reasonably mistaken in thinking the facts to be such as would give him a legal right to the goods.|$|E
2500|$|Physician–patient {{privilege}} {{is usually}} statutorily defined, and {{can vary from}} state to state. [...] The usual rule is that medical records are immune from subpoena if the plaintiff has not alleged physical or mental injuries or damages. [...] Once the plaintiff alleges physical or mental injuries proximately flowing from a potentially <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> by the defendant, or in some other disability hearing, medical records can be subject to subpoena duces tecum. [...] While witnesses may try to resist legal discovery [...] by asking the judge to protect them from questioning or inspection of documents, the policy of the courts is in favor of full disclosure. It is the intent of the rules of procedure that pre-trial discovery take place without any intervention of a judge. So-called [...] "fishing expeditions" [...] (massive and aimless calls for all documents related to the litigation) are permissible under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (1). This rule is repeated in many states' rules of procedure: [...] "Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant ... if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." [...] The looseness of the definition of relevant evidence is generally construed to mean [...] "liberal" [...] production. The physician who is the party to an action does not own the records of patients he has treated. They are not privileged if the patient has waived confidentiality. Physicians must produce medical records under subpoena duces tecum.|$|E

50|$|Filártiga v. Peña-Irala, 630 F.2d 876 (2d Cir. 1980), was a {{landmark}} case in United States and international law. It set the precedent for United States federal courts to punish non-American citizens for <b>tortious</b> <b>acts</b> committed outside the United States {{that were in}} violation of public international law (the law of nations) or any treaties to which the United States is a party. It thus extends the jurisdiction of United States courts to <b>tortious</b> <b>acts</b> committed around the world.

5000|$|A {{commentator}} {{argued that}} the court was wrong to condemn sock puppetry, as such, by finding [...] "that the act of falsifying multiple identities is the conduct to be enjoined." [...] He insisted that the behavior properly to be proscribed is the tortious interference, not the means to the end. [...] "In other words, the act of creating sock puppets {{in and of itself}} cannot be a <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> and since it is not the <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> the court can't proscribe it." [...] The court misses the point; [...] "it's not the account creation that caused the defamation, it is the use to which those accounts were put." [...] Accordingly, [...] "the court should not have enjoined the creation of false identities, it should have enjoined the use of those false identities to create a false impression" [...] about plaintiff NDYA.|$|E

50|$|Negligence in {{employment}} encompasses several causes {{of action in}} tort law that arise where an employer is held liable for the <b>tortious</b> <b>acts</b> of an employee because that employer was negligent in providing the employee {{with the ability to}} engage in a particular act. Four basic causes of action may arise from such a scenario: negligent hiring, negligent retention, negligent supervision and negligent training. While negligence {{in employment}} may overlap with negligent entrustment and vicarious liability, the concepts are distinct grounds of liability.|$|R

His emails were analogous to letters or phone calls into New York, which are again insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. As for the <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> branch of the long-arm statute, he was not physically within the state of New York when he created the website. Finally, the provision concerning tortious acts committed outside of the state was not applicable because Goldberger had not received any revenue from his website.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{liability}} insurance {{was written on}} an occurrence basis, meaning that the insurer agreed to defend and indemnify against any loss which allegedly [...] "occurred" [...] {{as a result of}} an act or omission of the insured during the policy period. [...] This was originally not a problem because it was thought that insureds' tort liability was predictably limited by doctrines like proximate cause and statutes of limitations. In other words, it was thought that no sane plaintiffs' lawyer would sue in 1978 for a <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> that allegedly occurred in 1953, because the risk of dismissal was so obvious.|$|E
50|$|In the {{unanimous}} {{decision of the}} Court, Justice Scalia held that the tribal courts {{did not have the}} authority over the Wardens' allegedly <b>tortious</b> <b>acts.</b> Tribal authority over non-members beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government is not available without express congressional delegation, since delegation did not exist the tribal court had no jurisdiction. Finally, the tribal court has no authority to regulate state officers in their official capacities, stating that tribal law hinders state law no more than state law inhibits federal law.|$|R
50|$|The court {{reasoned}} that the <b>tortious</b> <b>acts</b> of the defendant were not “based upon a commercial activity”, therefore not {{in violation of the}} Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. The defendant’s conduct, however heinous, could not be classified as being “based upon a commercial activity”. The tortious conduct rather is a gross abuse of state police power, which is an act only performed by sovereign states. Only States perform acts such as unlawful detention of private citizens, torture, conduct foreign engagements and diplomatic relations. Private citizens cannot participate in acts of State.|$|R
50|$|Transferred {{intent is}} the legal {{principle}} that intent can be transferred from one victim or tort to another. 1 In tort law, there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, and trespass to chattels.

50|$|The United States has waived {{sovereign}} immunity {{to a limited}} extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives the immunity if a <b>tortious</b> <b>act</b> of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which waives the immunity over claims arising out of contracts to which {{the federal government is}} a party. The Federal Tort Claims Act and the Tucker Act are not the broad waivers of {{sovereign immunity}} they might appear to be, as {{there are a number of}} statutory exceptions and judicially fashioned limiting doctrines applicable to both. Title 28 U.S.C. § 1331 confers federal question jurisdiction on district courts, but this statute has been held not to be a blanket waiver of sovereign immunity on the part of the federal government.|$|E

Based on the presumption that DoubleClick falls within the ambit of the Wiretap Statute, the court proceeded to determine whether DoubleClick was excluded from liability {{by virtue of the}} consent exception under the Wiretap Statute. The court held that DoubleClick was exempt from liability for intercepting the communications under the Wiretap Statute because the web sites, being one of the parties to the electronic communication with the users, had given DoubleClick prior consent to the interception. The court held that the consent exception remains valid as the communication was not intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or <b>tortious</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{government}} recognizes tribal nations as [...] "domestic dependent nations" [...] and {{has established a}} number of laws attempting to clarify {{the relationship between the}} federal, state, and tribal governments. Generally speaking, Native American tribes enjoy immunity from suit - in federal, state, or tribal courts - unless they consent to suit, or unless the {{federal government}} abrogates that immunity.However, individual members of the tribe are not immune. Under certain circumstances, a tribal official acting in his or her official capacity, and within the scope of his or her statutory authority, may be cloaked with sovereign immunity. But if a tribal official's <b>tortious</b> <b>acts</b> exceed the scope of his or her authority, the official is subject to suit for those acts. See Cosentino vs. Fuller, Cal. Ct.

40|$|<b>Tortious</b> <b>acts</b> {{of legal}} {{entities}} have unforeseen harmful consequences in all areas. In the greedy desire to gain profit, certain legal entities {{do not have}} any regard for the most important resources of individuals and society. Damage resulting from the commission of criminal acts is very high for the whole society, {{especially when it comes to}} crimes against the environment. In order to prevent and combat corporate crime in criminal law, an increasingly wider acceptance of criminal liability of legal entities was adopted. This paper discusses the basic characteristics of corporate crime, as well as the reasons for the introduction of the criminal responsibility of legal entities. In this regard, we analyzed the law provisions regarding the liability of legal entities for criminal offenses, and concluded that despite the criminal-political need to react with more serious sanctions to the offenses of legal entities, there are certain obstacles and problems that stand in the way of introducing this responsibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{client-server}} architecture implies that some modules are delivered to customers.
