5|$|A {{study in}} 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> male signers used {{constructed}} action, {{with or without}} constructed dialogue, more often than White signers, but never used constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.|$|E

They also mention <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> killed thirteen Muggles and his former friend Peter Pettigrew.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E

5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White {{should try to}} win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows <b>that</b> <b>black</b> holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speculative}} theories on the origin of the Brunswickers' dark and seemingly grim choice of garb. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>black</b> was chosen to mourn Duke Frederick William's late father; as a sign of respect for the Duke; or in mourning for the Duke's occupied homeland. Colonel Augustus Frazer, who had served alongside the Brunswickers, reported <b>that</b> <b>black</b> was adopted in mourning for the Duke's wife, Princess Marie of Baden, who had died in 1808, and that the black uniforms would not be put aside until Brunswick had been finally liberated.|$|E
5|$|When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} {{of differences between}} the signing of Black and White signers.

5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
5|$|After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black {{can avoid}} the {{immediate}} exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating <b>that</b> <b>Black</b> has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually equalize.|$|E

Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E

He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them.
