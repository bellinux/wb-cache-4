5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of <b>this</b> <b>large</b> untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for <b>this</b> <b>large</b> growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with <b>this</b> <b>large</b> force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. <b>This</b> <b>large</b> capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place.|$|E
5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, {{as he had}} never worked on a production <b>this</b> <b>large</b> in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced {{when he heard the}} opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with <b>this</b> <b>large</b> quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate <b>this</b> <b>large</b> expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick may remain attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken.

His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across <b>this</b> <b>large</b> camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. <b>This</b> <b>large</b> mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>large</b> difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
