5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway.

After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen.

More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cases each year has decreased since 2000.

5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
5|$|The post-war boom in {{automobile}} {{travel and}} the construction of the Interstate Highway System, as well as competition from commercial airlines, led to the decline of passenger rail. The Pennsylvania Railroad eliminated passenger service between Erie and Pittsburgh in April1948. It eventually ended through service to Philadelphia, requiring passengers to transfer in Emporium, Pennsylvania, and discontinued service from Erie altogether on March27, 1965. By 1968, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York Central trains was also reduced to five per day. The two railroads were merged on February1, 1968, and formed the Penn Central Transportation Company. Penn Central continued to run the former New York Central passenger trains, until the last departed Union Station on April30, 1971. The newly created National Passenger Rail Corporation, more commonly known as Amtrak, took over nationwide passenger rail operations the next day. Amtrak continued to operate a New York-to-Chicago train until January1972, the Lake Shore, which had a station stop in Erie starting in November1971. However, the poor condition of the track between Buffalo and Chicago, as well as the service's general lack of profitability, led to the Lake Shores demise. Erie remained devoid of any passenger rail service until Amtrak reintroduced the former New York Central train, the Lake Shore Limited, on November30, 1975.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. Tuberculosis {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the US population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a lull in}} {{building}} after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural estate houses. Isolated examples included the houses designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–39), which combined modern and traditional elements. The Second World War disrupted the occupation of estate houses, as they were used as wartime schools, barracks, evacuee housing and hospitals. After the war many were outdated, {{with a lack of}} electricity and modern plumbing. There was a shortage of live-in servants and the heavily taxed aristocracy were also unable to find the money to modernise and maintain large houses. The shortage of building materials in the post-war period also made estate houses valuable resources of stone. As a result, 200 of the 378 architecturally important estate houses have been demolished, were destroyed in the period after 1945, a higher proportion of the total than in England. Included in the destruction were works by Robert Adam, including Balbardie House and Hamilton Palace. One firm, Charles Brand of Dundee, demolished at least 56 country houses in Scotland in the 20 years between 1945 and 1965. The shortage of building materials further reduced <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses.|$|E
