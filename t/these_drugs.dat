5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E

For many patients who can navigate combinations {{of drugs and}} time their doses precisely, <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> regimens typically slow the progression {{of the disease and}} lengthen survival.

Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox.

5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on <b>these</b> <b>drugs,</b> and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E

Each of <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

30|$|Formulation of liposomes {{containing}} doxorubicin {{and magnetic}} nanoparticles {{has been developed}} as {{a part in the}} integrating treatment of chemotherapy and hyperthermia with the introduction of high-frequency magnetic field system. Cytotoxicity screening of blank drug carriers against mammalian cells, L- 929 fibroblast cells, showed that <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> carriers exhibited no cytotoxicity against cellular system which further emphasized <b>these</b> <b>drug</b> carriers as a potential candidate for biocompatible materials. However, the combination between DOX and magnetic liposomes (drug concentration 1  μM) and high-frequency magnetic field treatment synergistically would increase the cytotoxicity effects to kill colorectal cancer cells. Eventually, these results confirmed the potential application of this drug carrier for cancer treatment through combination between chemotherapy (drug-controlled release) and hyperthermia (inductive heating).|$|R
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. <b>These</b> <b>drugs</b> are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E

A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with <b>these</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of <b>these</b> <b>drugs</b> is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
