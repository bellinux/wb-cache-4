5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and <b>transmission</b> <b>capacity</b> to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E

40|$|In the German {{power system}} there is notably a high {{concentration}} of installed wind power capacity in the north. To increase the share of wind power in the German electricity system further extensions are planned in the North Sea as off-shore wind farms. By contrast the main consumption areas are in the midland of Germany. This requires large <b>transmissions</b> <b>capacities</b> to transfer the power from north to south. It is unclear whether the German transmission grid in its actual design can meet the future requirements and how the electricity prices are affected by possible transmission restrictions. Case studies to evaluate the restrictions of the actual German transmission grid and the impacts on electricity prices and the unit commitment are presented. Wind power extensions as they are envisaged for the years 2010 and 2020 are studied and compared to the year 2001. The effect of the installation of further <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> from North to South is also analysed. The behaviour of wind generation is thereby modelled with a stochastic linear programming model where the dispatch of the conventional generating units in the electricity system is governed by trade on a day-ahead electricity market, an hour-ahead regulatory power dispatch as well as district and process heat requirements. The results of the case studies show that the <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> from North-West to the midlands are not suffi-cient to cover the future wind power extensions.

40|$|In a {{recently}} published {{work by the}} authors, a novel framework was developed and applied for assessment of reliability and quality performance levels in real-life power systems with practical large-scale sizes. The new assessment method-ology is based on three metaphors (dimensions) representing the relationship between available generation capacities and required demand levels. The developed reliability and performance quality indices were deterministic in nature. That is, they represent one operating state (a snapshot of the system conditions) in which the required demand {{as well as the}} generation and <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> are known with 100 % certainty. In real life, however, load variations occur randomly so as the contingencies which cause some generation and/or <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> to be lost (become un-available). In other words, neither the load levels nor the generation or <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> are known with absolute certainty. They are rather subject to random variations and, consequently, the calculated reliability and performance quality indices are all subject to random variations where only expected values of these indices can be evaluated. This paper presents a major extension to the previously published work by developing a theory and formulas for computing the expected values of different system reliability and performance quality indices. In this context, a “contingency sce-nario ” or a system “demand level ” are regarded, in a more general sense, as a “state”, which occurs with certain prob-ability and represents a given demand value and availability pattern of various capacities in the system.

In this paper we present two approaches to determine the location and amount of ramping capabilities for corrective control measures in the case of errors in the forecast of the line rating. Both approaches result in robust optimization problems, where the first approach guarantees that there is a suitable remedial action for every realization of uncertainty in a given uncertainty set. The corrective control action is calculated once the forecast error is known. The second approach relies on affine policies which directly relate the current line rating to corrective control measures, if needed, which enables a decentralized operation. In case studies, the two approaches are compared and the reduction of overall operational costs is demonstrated exemplarily for different parameters. I...|$|R
40|$|Transmission is an {{integral}} part of the electricity system. However, even within a centralised system of generation and transmission it has never been a trivial exercise to perform coordination of expanding loads, generation and <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> in a way that is socially optimal. There are features like lumpy investments, pervasive transmission system externalities, reliability as a public good, and the spatial distribution of both generation and <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities.</b> The unbundling of transmission and generation of newly deregulated electricity systems have substantially increased these coordination problems. To pursue proactive planning the investment decisions of independent generating investors have to be forecasted with sufficient accuracy in order to decide on socially optimal transmission investments. This calls for a systematic use of scenario simulations identifying locational generation investment and corresponding transmission investments. But since investors cannot be forced to invest, incentive schemes must be devised as part of the scenario simulations in order to entice both the right volume and the right location over time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper characterizes {{equilibrium}} in {{an auction}} market constrained by limited capacities of links in a transportation network. The formulation {{is adapted to}} a wholesale spot market for electricity managed by the operator of the transmission system. This paper derives conditions that characterize equilibrium in an auction market of the kind conducted by system operators in the electricity industry. These are wholesale spot markets in which the participants are suppliers (generators) and demanders (utilities and other load-serving entities). Because these participants are spatially distributed, the operator’s allocation of production and consumption of electrical energy is constrained by the capacities of links in the transmission system. Moreover, storage is infeasible, supply must continually match demand, and both net demand and <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities</b> are affected by random shocks. Therefore, participants submit notional supply or demand functions in advance and then in each contingency the operator uses these functions to determine an optimal allocation. 1 Financial settlements in such markets use locational marginal pricing, also called nodal pricing. The operator chooses the allocation in each contingency to maximize the apparent gain from trade subject to the feasibility constraints imposed by limited <b>transmission</b> <b>capacities.</b> (This is the gain from trade “as bid ” since the operator treats each supply function as though it reflects the actual marginal cost of production.)
