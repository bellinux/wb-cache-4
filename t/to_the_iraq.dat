5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's {{presentation to the}} United Nations on February 6, 2003. When {{weapons of mass destruction}} were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> Inquiry, focusing predominantly on {{his role}} as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E

On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon to be deployed instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet to be deployed to a foreign theater of operations or participate in any conflicts or contingencies.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
