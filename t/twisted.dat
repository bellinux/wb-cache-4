To fight back against the <b>Twisted,</b> an investigatory team called the Counter <b>Twisted</b> Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia {{two years before the}} game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the <b>Twisted.</b> At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the <b>Twisted</b> and regain her memories.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b are the {{principal}} components of <b>twists</b> that negatively regulate a number of cellular signaling events. Expression of runx 2 and downstream targets is essential for skeletal development and ventral organizer formation and specification in early vertebrate embryos, but what controls ventral activity of maternal runx 2 and how <b>twists</b> function in zebrafish embryogenesis still remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying the loss of <b>twist</b> induced by injection of morpholino-oligonucleotide in zebrafish, we found that <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b, but not <b>twist</b> 2 or <b>twist</b> 3, were required for proper skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning in early embryos. Overexpression of <b>twist</b> 1 a or <b>twist</b> 1 b following mRNA injection resulted in deteriorated skeletal development and formation of typical dorsalized embryos, whereas knockdown of <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b {{led to the formation}} of abnormal embryos with enhanced skeletal formation and typical ventralized patterning. Overexpression of <b>twist</b> 1 a or <b>twist</b> 1 b decreased the expression of runx 2 b, whereas <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown increased runx 2 b expression. We have further demonstrated that phenotypes induced by <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown were rescued by runx 2 b knockdown. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b control skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning by regulating runx 2 b in zebrafish and provide potential targets for the treatment of diseases or syndromes associated with decreased skeletal development...|$|R

On the other hand, biallelic <b>Twist</b> 2 deficiency causes only a focal facial dermal dysplasia syndrome or additional cachexia and perinatal lethality in certain mouse strains. It is unclear how these proteins cooperate to synergistically regulate bone formation. <b>Twist</b> 1 floxed mice (<b>Twist</b> 1 (f/f)) were bred with <b>Twist</b> 2 -Cre knock-in mice (<b>Twist</b> 2 (Cre/+)) to generate <b>Twist</b> 1 and <b>Twist</b> 2 haploinsufficient mice (<b>Twist</b> 1 (f/+); <b>Twist</b> 2 (Cre/+)).

These mice exhibited decreased expressions of Fgf 2 and Fgfr 1 - 4 in bone, resulting in a down-regulation of FGF signaling. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that both <b>Twist</b> 1 and <b>Twist</b> 2 stimulated 4. 9 kb Fgfr 2 promoter activity in the presence of E 12, a <b>Twist</b> binding partner.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>TWIST</b> 1 gene has diverse {{roles in}} {{development}} and pathologic {{diseases such as}} cancer. <b>TWIST</b> 1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as <b>TWIST</b> 1 -TWIST 1 or <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 / 47. <b>TWIST</b> 1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr 125 and Ser 127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of <b>TWIST</b> 1. The significance of these <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing <b>TWIST</b> 1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type <b>TWIST</b> 1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas {{the expression of the}} <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 heterodimers phenocopied the <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ 235 strongly attenuated <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by <b>TWIST</b> 1 dimeric partner choice...|$|R
