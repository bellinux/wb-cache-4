5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo {{publicly}} {{claimed responsibility}} for shooting down the Hunyani {{in an interview with}} the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E
5|$|The Light Division {{tried to}} {{systematically}} reconquer the Island of Dordrecht by advancing {{on a broad}} front, using four battalions with little artillery support. On its left flank, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> enemy presence, the advance went according to plan. The battalion on the right flank however, ran into an attacking German force of battalion strength that had been ordered by General Student to circle around {{the outskirts of the}} city to relieve the pressure being placed on his troops holding the Dort bridges. In confused street fighting the German troops were successful in blocking the battalion; the other Dutch units then halted their advance around noon. Though higher command soon ordered a better concentration of forces instead of some mopping-up action, due to a lack of clear lines of command, no subsequent attack materialised that day.|$|E
25|$|The {{water supply}} in Miyakojima depends mainly on spring water or ground water, since <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> rivers. Although the yearly {{rainfall}} amounts to , 40% of it evaporates, 10% {{flows into the}} ground and 50% penetrates deep into the ground. Thus, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> source of surface water.|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} prior to 2011, the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense {{floating}} ice far from it. In 2008, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> ice formation except {{for a short period}} in March.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the reasons}} {{children}} were placed in care related to poverty and family breakdown. Until social change came about in Australia in the 1970s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> community or government support for families in crisis or financial need so most children whose families could not care for them were placed {{in some form of}} out-of-home care.|$|E
25|$|Police {{administration}} {{consultation and}} training was most effective with the Sûreté, Vietnam's national law enforcement agency, {{in part because}} the majority of equipment was delivered to this agency. By the same token, municipal police departments (who received less equipment) were less affected—the greatest local improvement was in traffic control in Saigon. With regard to the civil guard, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> effect.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{claims that}} {{government}} meddling {{in health care}} delivery {{is to blame for}} healthcare costs having skyrocketed over the past few decades. He recalls that in the early 1960s, patients typically paid for basic medical services with cash, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> government payment for care, and as those Americans who had private insurance were typically only covered for hospitalization and emergency care.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the star}} was {{suspected}} of being variable during a 1981 study, subsequent observation showed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> chromospheric activity between 1977 and 1989. Further examination between 1994 and 2007 showed a similar low or flat level of activity. This, along with its relatively low X-ray emission, suggests that the star {{may be in a}} Maunder minimum period during which a star produces a reduced number of star spots.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the great}} archaeological {{excavations}} in the 19th century, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> historical {{knowledge of the}} great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital. Other cities that had perished, such as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, no vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood became {{only a matter of}} conjecture.|$|E

25|$|In the South, {{many poor}} whites were {{illiterate}} as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> public education before the war. In 1880, for example, the white illiteracy rate was about 25% in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia; and {{as high as}} 33% in North Carolina. This compares with the 9% national rate, and a black rate of illiteracy that was over 70% in the South. By 1900, however, with emphasis within the black community on education, the majority of blacks had achieved literacy.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the concept}} {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution to the tracking problem, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the ionosphere. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on Kwajalein Atoll, while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.|$|E
25|$|General Philippe Morillon of France, Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), visited Srebrenica in March 1993. By {{then the}} town was overcrowded and siege {{conditions}} prevailed. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed the town’s water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity, and food, medicine and other essentials were extremely scarce. Before leaving, General Morillon told the panicked residents of Srebrenica at a public gathering that {{the town was}} {{under the protection of}} the UN and that he would never abandon them.|$|E
30|$|Summarizing {{the results}} of our {{statistical}} analysis, we found three characteristics: (1) <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> dependence on the solar wind parameters. (2) <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> dependence on geomagnetic activity. (3) There exists the clear seasonal dependence with the topographical characteristics. These cannot be explained by the phenomena having the origin in the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the ionosphere, while it may be attributed to the processes in the lower atmosphere.|$|R

25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Lettow-Vorbeck had already ordered his western units to retreat after Hptm. Göring was wounded. Having lost several {{officers}} and NCOs on the battle's first day, he could simply risk no more casualties among them. As <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> communication possible {{between the different}} detachements due to the problematic terrain, Lettow-Vorbeck noticed the attack on his rearguard units only when {{he had begun to}} ascend the northern hills with the withdrawing Abt Göring and Abt Müller. By then it had become too late for the German commander to make contact with or aid the now beleagured forces of Stemmermann and Wahle.|$|E
25|$|Destructive {{surgeries}} are irreversible {{and involve}} removing entire functionality of most, if not all, {{of the affected}} ear; as of 2013, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> evidence with which to judge whether these surgeries are effective. The inner ear itself can be surgically removed via labyrinthectomy, although hearing is always completely lost in the affected ear with this operation. The surgeon can also cut the nerve to the balance portion of the inner ear in a vestibular neurectomy. Hearing is often mostly preserved; however, the surgery involves cutting open into {{the lining of the}} brain, and a hospital stay of a few days for monitoring would be required.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, {{including}} huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by The Age (pro-Berry) and The Argus (anti-Berry) - although, remarkably, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> violence. Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was to pass a bill through the Assembly stating that finance bills {{did not need to be}} passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned.|$|E
25|$|The Transcaucasian SFSR was {{dissolved}} in 1936 {{and as a}} result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The transition to communism was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> freedom of speech, even less so under Joseph Stalin. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to Siberia during Stalinist rule. Even Zabel Yessayan, a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian Genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.|$|E
25|$|The final army {{conference of}} the Ninth Army took place at 1500 hours on April 28. At this point, contact was lost with the V Corps and the V SS Mountain Corps. The conference found that the only {{possible}} break-out route had to lead through Halbe. This was not difficult for the Soviet commanders to deduce as well, while, on the other hand, Ninth Army had virtually no information about the Soviet force dispositions {{between it and the}} Twelfth Army. From this conference onward, command and control within the Ninth Army collapsed. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> contact between the Ninth Army headquarters and Army Group Vistula, and little contact with formations under Ninth Army command. There were few or no maps to guide planning or combat operations.|$|E
