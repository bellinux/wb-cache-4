5|$|While filming <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Keller and {{her team}} perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do.

During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Tracy {{is on his}} bacon run, every {{mention of}} January 17th is either shot so the actor's mouth is hidden or dubbed over.
