Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to gouge extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above <b>those</b> <b>limits,</b> claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus {{not subject to the}} laws of those states {{as long as they were}} headquartered elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|All {{single bit}} errors within the bitfilter period {{mentioned}} above (for even {{terms in the}} generator polynomial) can be identified uniquely by their residual. So CRC method {{can be used to}} correct single-bit errors as well (within <b>those</b> <b>limits,</b> e.g. 32767 bits with optimal generator polynomials of degree 16). Since all odd errors leave an odd residual, all even an even residual, 1-bit errors and 2-bit errors can be distinguished. However, like other SECDED techniques, CRCs cannot always distinguish between 1-bit errors and 3-bit errors. When 3 or more bit errors occur in a block, CRC bit error correction will be erroneous itself and produce more errors.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects <b>those</b> <b>limits</b> as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E

500|$|Prompted by {{the launch}} of and {{misinformation}} about , the US Navy and Congress faced what they perceived as a vastly better battleship than the two [...] battleships then under construction, which were designed under tonnage constraints that Congress had imposed on capital ships. Actually, the South Carolinas were inferior only in speed to Dreadnought; they carried fewer heavy guns but, unlike Dreadnought, could bring {{all of them to}} bear on the broadside. Because of this, they could fire an equal weight of metal. Also, because greater time and care had been taken with their armor and bulkhead arrangement, they were better protected than the British ship. None of this was realized at the time. Nevertheless, the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) had struggled tremendously to design an adequate warship under congressional limits and had taken battleship design as far under those restrictions as it could. Seeing now that <b>those</b> <b>limits</b> had become unrealistic, Congress ended them; any subsequent constraints would be dictated by treaty limitations.

500|$|In the {{developmental}} transition from God of War III to Ascension, {{one of the}} graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that {{the limits of the}} God of War III engine restricted artist creativity, so they [...] "tried to remove or push <b>those</b> <b>limits</b> as far as possible without losing any performance." [...] For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, [...] "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat." [...] Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. Ascension was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as God of War III had been: [...] "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree God of War: Ascension was more refinement on the graphics front" [...] said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during Ascensions development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from God of War III: [...] "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" [...] said Perthuis.|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2012, Sony {{released}} a teaser image for Ascension on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which {{was followed by}} the game's announcement on April 19 on PlayStation.Blog. Todd Papy, who had previously worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as design director on God of War III, assumed the role of game director; God of War III director Stig Asmussen was busy with another project at Santa Monica and did not work on Ascension. [...] The announcement officially confirmed the game's title and Papy said it was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy. The game features a retooled God of War III engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity, according to lead combat designer Jason McDonald. The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos, and McDonald said the testers had [...] "a lot of fun". Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value and they then began to put the [...] "God of War spin on it".

2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} Peter Gleick comments: [...] "Few rational observers {{deny the}} need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where <b>those</b> <b>limits</b> are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries {{is the concept of}} peak water. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world’s major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California’s Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred [...] The {{good news is that the}} potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind." ...|$|E
