5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers {{recorded}} a version for their debut album based on Gladys' recent hit; however, {{after hearing the}} Marvin Gaye version, they felt they'd made the wrong choice. In 1969, Whitfield produced a version for the Temptations [...] "psychedelic soul" [...] album, Cloud Nine, in which he [...] "brought compelling percussion to the fore, and relegated the piano well into the wings". In 1971, the Undisputed Truth recorded the song in a Marvin-styled version as did Bettye Lavette on her 1982 Motown album, <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Lie.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of people are having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 23, CBS lost the bidding for the footage to Life magazine's $150,000 offer. CBS news {{correspondent}} Dan Rather {{was the first to}} report on the footage on national television after seeing it, although the inaccuracies in his description would contribute to many conspiracy theories about the assassination. In his 2001 book <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>A</b> Story, CBS producer Don Hewitt said that he told Rather to go to Zapruder's home to [...] "sock him in the jaw", take the film, copy it, then return it and let the network's lawyers deal with the consequences. According to Hewitt, he realized his mistake after ending their telephone conversation and immediately called Rather back to countermand the order. In a 2015 interview on Opie with Jim Norton, Rather stated that the story was a myth.|$|E
