5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: <b>this</b> <b>arrangement</b> was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully armored, <b>this</b> <b>arrangement</b> was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E
5|$|Two rows of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} plates are still partially articulated show <b>this</b> <b>arrangement.</b> <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> is chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
5|$|After <b>this</b> <b>arrangement,</b> Constantine {{ruled the}} dioceses of Pannonia and Macedonia and took {{residence}} at Sirmium, whence he could wage {{war on the}} Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1980s, {{representatives from}} Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have {{attended}} many OPEC meetings as observers. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{serves as an}} informal mechanism for coordinating policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{clothing}} and textile industry has benefited most from <b>this</b> <b>arrangement.</b> As tariffs on these goods into the United States are relatively high, exporters {{have used the}} duty-free benefits of QIZs to gain quick access to markets in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{plates were}} paired {{in a double}} row along the back. This is {{probably}} the most common arrangement in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has <b>this</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E

50|$|It was {{essentially}} a 4R with a DOHC head designed by Yamaha. The cam lobes activated the valves directly via a bucket over shim <b>arrangement.</b> <b>This</b> same <b>arrangement</b> was used on the 2M, 8R-G, 10R, 18R-G, 2T-G, 4A-GE and 3T-GTE engines (all designed by Yamaha).|$|R

5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in <b>this</b> <b>arrangement</b> until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of <b>this</b> <b>arrangement</b> during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|Busy Bee was {{contracted}} by the Norwegian Armed Forces to fly military charters in June 1968. They had two 50-passenger Fokker F27 Friendships {{stationed at}} Høybuktmoen and flew two daily services from Kirkenes and other locations in Northern Norway to Bodø, with onwards connection to Stavanger and Oslo on Fridays. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> continued until Busy Bee's bankruptcy in 1992.|$|E

5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in <b>this</b> <b>arrangement).</b> It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} section that he named Oncostylis. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> would stand for over a century.|$|E
5|$|FBS {{teams are}} allowed to {{schedule}} FCS teams, and one win against an FCS team can be counted towards their bowl-eligible status provided the FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements. FCS teams are often paid upwards of USD $500,000 for participating in games against FBS teams. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> generally results in lopsided losses for FCS teams, but the money FCS schools earn from games against FBS teams helps fund their athletic departments, as well as offering broader exposure for their athletic programs.|$|E

50|$|The {{first use}} of the name American to {{describe}} locomotives of <b>this</b> wheel <b>arrangement</b> was made by Railroad Gazette in April 1872. Prior to that, <b>this</b> wheel <b>arrangement</b> {{was known as a}} standard or eight-wheeler. This locomotive type was so successful on railroads in the United States of America that many earlier 4-2-0 and 2-4-0 locomotives were rebuilt as 4-4-0s {{by the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, <b>this</b> <b>arrangement</b> may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> lasted {{only a few months}} before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{the route}} of US25 through the Port Huron area was realigned. In the process, that highway {{replaced}} its alternate route, and the former alignment through downtown was redesignated as a business loop. <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> lasted until 1973 when US25 itself was decommissioned in Michigan. The former routing of Bus. US25 through downtown Port Huron became part of an extended M-25. In 1986, the former business loop was redesignated Business Loop I-94.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). <b>This</b> <b>arrangement</b> stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E

50|$|James Sinclair was {{appointed}} in 1841 by Duncan Finlayson to guide over twenty settler families from the Red River Colony to the Pacific Northwest. Upon arriving at Fort Vancouver, fourteen {{of them were}} relocated to Fort Nisqually, while the remaining seven families were sent to Fort Cowlitz. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>arrangements</b> with the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company, a HBC subsidiary, proved to be unsatisfactory for the settlers, who all gradually moved to the Willamette Valley.|$|R
