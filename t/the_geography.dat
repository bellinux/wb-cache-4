40|$|Recent anti-systemic social {{movements}} have illustrated {{the central role}} of cities in social movement mobilization. We not only highlight the characteristics of urban social relations that make cities fertile ground for mobilization, but also point to the disjunctures between <b>the</b> <b>geographies</b> and spatialities of social relations in the city, and <b>the</b> <b>geographies</b> and spatialities of many systemic processes. Struggles for a more just society must consider <b>the</b> broad <b>geographies</b> and spatialities of oppression, which we illustrate with a brief analysis of the Occupy movement. Finally, we introduce the next five articles in this special issue, all illustrating the importance of <b>the</b> <b>geographies</b> and spatialities of urban social struggle...|$|R
5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>geography</b> of Scotland in {{the early}} modern era covers {{all aspects of the}} land in Scotland, {{including}} physical and human, between the sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Agricultural Revolution and industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The defining factor in <b>the</b> <b>geography</b> of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>geography</b> of {{mountain}} ranges bordering the Mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms, with the sloped nature {{of mountain}}ous regions permitting {{the development of}} convective activity. Although <b>the</b> <b>geography</b> of the Mediterranean region, {{as well as its}} dry air, typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones, when certain meteorological circumstances arise, difficulties influenced by the region's geography are overcome. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea is generally extremely rare, with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study, with no definitive trend in activity in that period. Few medicanes form during the summer season, though activity typically rises in autumn, peaks in January, and gradually decreases from February to May. In the western Mediterranean region of development, approximately 0.75such systems form each year, compared to 0.32in the Ionian Sea region.|$|E
5|$|As {{a naturalist}} {{he had a}} great curiosity, observing <b>the</b> <b>geography,</b> geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Indian Zoology although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E

40|$|For almost 30 years, the Soviet {{government}} hid a {{large part}} of its biological weapons programme behind the façade of a network of civilian bio-technology facilities, called the All-Union Production Association Biopreparat, which were established to overcome deficiencies in molecular biology and genetics research. This paper, which is developed from a presentation given during an ESRC-sponsored seminar series, `Locating Technoscience: <b>The</b> <b>Geographies</b> of Science, Technology and Politics¿, details <b>the</b> secret <b>geography</b> of one of those Biopreparat facilities located in Stepnogorsk, Kazakhstan. In doing this the paper illustrates how secret geographies can operate simultaneously, and at multiple scales. In the case of the Soviet bio-weapons programme, enacting secrecy at these multiple scales was made possible by the purposeful exploitation of `dual use¿ technologies. By recounting a trip made to the Kazak facility, and using personal communications with UK and US experts involved with uncovering the Soviet bio-warfare programme, the author addresses some of the methodological challenges involved with researching secret geographies. This case study therefore looks in several directions ¿ to work on <b>the</b> <b>geographies</b> of scale, research on <b>the</b> <b>geographies</b> of knowledge and work on secrecy in science and technology studies...|$|R
