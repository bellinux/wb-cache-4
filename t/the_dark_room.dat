The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> scaring the uneducated spectators.|$|E

500|$|Narayan first {{broke through}} {{with the help of}} Graham Greene who, upon reading Swaminathan and Tate, took it upon himself to work as Narayan's agent for the book. He was also {{instrumental}} in changing the title to the more appropriate Swami and Friends, and in finding publishers for Narayan's next few books. While Narayan's early works were not commercial successes, other authors of the time began to notice him. Somerset Maugham, on a trip to Mysore in 1938, had asked to meet Narayan, but not enough people had heard of him to actually effect the meeting. Maugham subsequently read Narayan's <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Room,</b> and wrote to him expressing his admiration. Another contemporary writer who took a liking to Narayan's early works was E. M. Forster, an author who shared his dry and humorous narrative, so much so that Narayan was labeled the [...] "South Indian E. M. Forster" [...] by critics. Despite his popularity with the reading public and fellow writers, Narayan's work has not received the same amount of critical exploration accorded to other writers of his stature.|$|E

500|$|While vacationing at his sister's {{house in}} Coimbatore, in 1933, Narayan met {{and fell in}} love with Rajam, a 15-year-old girl who lived nearby. Despite many astrological and {{financial}} obstacles, Narayan managed to gain permission from the girl's father and married her. Following his marriage, Narayan became a reporter for a Madras-based paper called The Justice, dedicated to the rights of non-Brahmins. The publishers were thrilled to have a Brahmin Iyer in Narayan espousing their cause. The job brought him in contact with a wide variety of people and issues. Earlier, Narayan had sent the manuscript of Swami and Friends to a friend at Oxford, and about this time, the friend showed the manuscript to Graham Greene. Greene recommended the book to his publisher, and it was finally published in 1935. Greene also counseled Narayan on shortening his name to become more familiar to the English-speaking audience. The book was semi-autobiographical and built upon many incidents from his own childhood. Reviews were favourable but sales were few. Narayan's next novel The Bachelor of Arts (1937), was inspired in part by his experiences at college, and dealt with the theme of a rebellious adolescent transitioning to a rather well-adjusted adult; it was published by a different publisher, again at the recommendation of Greene. His third novel, <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> (1938) was about domestic disharmony, showcasing the man as the oppressor and the woman as the victim within a marriage, and was published by yet another publisher; this book also received good reviews. In 1937, Narayan's father died, and Narayan was forced to accept a commission from the government of Mysore [...] as he was not making any money.|$|E

Ibn al-Haytham is reported to have stated about the camera obscura: [...] "We did not invent this". al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations since circa 1200.

50|$|Klein {{spent hours}} in <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> {{creating}} <b>the</b> contrast or effect {{that he had}} in his mind.

He would then spend his time in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> to create his contrasting colors.His work entitled Zebra (1957) strongly shows this practice because of the sharp etching across the picture that creates an almost hypnotizing pattern.|$|R
