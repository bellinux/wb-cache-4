We show that under the incentive payment scheme that distributes some pre−determined <b>total</b> amount of <b>payments</b> equally to each contributor (the constant <b>total</b> <b>payment</b> scheme), the number of contributions can fluctuate cyclically as well as chaotically over time when the potential contributors form adaptive expectations. Numerical simulations suggest, among other things, that the performance of the constant <b>total</b> <b>payment</b> scheme may be more efficient than the constant per−capita payment scheme when the <b>total</b> amount of <b>payments</b> is supposed to be small...|$|R

40|$|Agri-environmental schemes {{are offered}} by a {{regulator}} to farmers. The farmer is to produce certain environmental goods and gets a pecuniary compensation for doing so. The problem of designing optimal schemes is dealt with using mechanisms design theory. This paper considers the situation where the regulator faces a budget constraint on <b>total</b> <b>payments</b> to farmers. It is shown, that 2 results of standard mechanisms design theory are affected when a budget restriction on <b>total</b> <b>payments</b> is present. 1) The "no distortion at the top rule" does not always hold. 2) It is not always optimal to offer heterogeneous farmers heterogeneous argi-environmental schemes.

This requires the reasonable pricing of the potential wireless relay nodes to maintain the inherent advantage in many alternative relay nodes and obtain the relative maximum income.|$|R
