[...] British singer-songwriter Ray Dorset, {{the leader of}} pop-blues band Mungo Jerry, played the kazoo on many of his band's recordings, as did former member Paul King.|$|E

Now my nose {{tells me}} that you are Korak. My nose is never wrong. I am your friend. Come, we shall hunt together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Begin at the beginning,' I insisted. 'Mrs. Mulvaney <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{married her}} {{when you were}} {{quartered}} in Krab Bokhar barracks.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "’Ow much?" [...] ses the conjurer, with a start. [...] "Well, I wish you’d <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> afore <b>you</b> lent it to me. Eighteenpence is my price." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you turned}} {{religious}} suddenly, Ralph?" [...] she asked. [...] "Or {{have you forgotten}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did not care to go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame Christophor," [...] he said, [...] "once you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> disliked and distrusted all men. Why, then, should I trust you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had broken}} her heart,' said Venetia; 'and she prayed to God that her child {{might not be}} so miserable.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Begin at the beginning," [...] I insisted. [...] "Mrs. Mulvaney <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{married her}} {{when you were}} {{quartered}} in Krab Bokhar barracks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{conscious}} of leaving your body when in trance," [...] I said. [...] "Do <b>you</b> always have <b>that</b> sensation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I {{speak of}} normal natures, said Stephen. <b>You</b> also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> were {{a boy in}} that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you were}} very nice to him. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> spent hours helping him {{to get rid of}} his slice, whatever that is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} been sure to come and walk with us, and we have all been saying that you had disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very important, Dr. Serviss, for Pratt has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{know the}} Lamberts and all about their {{relationship}} to Clarke. If you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because you are mine. You have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cared. Oh, you cannot {{escape from}} it. Anna, my love, you cannot have {{forgotten}} so soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps not}} even as you do," [...] she {{answered}} calmly. [...] "I believe <b>you</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought him a fanatic, but sincere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Basil," [...] said Dorian, [...] "what have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me?</b> Simply <b>that</b> <b>you</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> admired <b>me</b> too much. <b>That</b> is {{not even}} a compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; at least, I suppose so. I hope she's a good manager. She {{ought to}} be, for she's a very disagreeable woman. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> yourself, <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{answered}} her husband, [...] "you have often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were sure no harm {{would come to}} Rachel, and I think that, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{it was all}} a lie on {{the part}} of Mr. Neefit? Was there no {{foundation}} for it? <b>You</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yourself <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought of such a marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he said, with {{a certain}} note of {{challenge}} in his tone, [...] "I am not certain <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know concerning the Princess's visit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Jack, for interrupting," [...] said Peterkin; [...] "surely {{you must}} be mistaken in <b>that.</b> You've often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> were a baby you used to howl and roar from morning to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just asked}} for you," [...] John explained. [...] "The doorkeeper <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were engaged, but I {{persuaded him to}} let me come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Abbey burns. Why, Nurse, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> said {{it would}} be so, yonder amid the ashes of Cranwell Towers. Surely you are foresighted." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tita smiled. [...] "You {{would not}} like to lose that, eh? though you care little about losing me. And yet you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> loved me!" ...|$|E

The only {{question}} is, are you {{on top of that}} trouble or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{are very}} ungrateful, Grammer, to say <b>that.</b> But <b>you</b> are ill, I know, and <b>that's</b> why <b>you</b> speak so. Now believe me, {{you are not}} going to die yet. Remember <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> meant to keep him waiting many a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} you are come; I came to inquire at the door, and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were here. How is she, poor thing?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You would ask, what cause I {{have for}} inquiring? I {{will tell you}} presently.

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] says Mr. Tulkinghorn. [...] "You <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> Snagsby, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> put on {{your hat}} and came round without {{mentioning}} your intention to your wife.

6000|$|... 'Welcome! I have {{expected}} you. You could not surprise old Miriam. The teraph <b>told</b> <b>me</b> last night <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be here....' ...|$|R
