40|$|Presents summary data of <b>allocated</b> health <b>expenditure</b> {{collected}} by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are Australia’s largest health problem, accounting for 50, 294 deaths in 2002 and affecting 3. 67 million Australians in 2001 (AIHW 2004 b). In 1998, 1. 1 million Australians had disabling conditions associated with cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases are the most expensive diseases in Australia in terms of health expenditure. They were responsible for 11 % of <b>total</b> <b>allocated</b> recurrent health system expenditure—$ 5. 48 billion in 2000 – 01 (AIHW 2004 a). The following is an overview of <b>total</b> <b>allocated</b> health system <b>expenditure</b> associated with cardiovascular diseases in Australia. These expenditure estimates are for the period 2000 – 01 and are the most up-to-date data currently available. Estimates are presented by area of expenditure: hospitals, high level services in aged care homes, out-of-hospital medical services, dental and other health professional services, pharmaceuticals and research. These figures do not represent estimates of the total economic impact of cardiovascular diseases in the Australian community. As well as the direct health system expenditure described here, there is substantial indirect expenditure relating to absenteeism, lost productivity, the burden on carers and family, and lost {{quality and quantity of}} life...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{work in the}} {{sociology}} of economic development has emphasized {{the establishment of a}} professional bureaucracy in place of political appointees as {{an important component of the}} institutional environment in which private enterprise can flourish. I hypothesize that establishment of such a bureaucracy will lengthen the period that public decision makers are willing to wait to realize the benefits of expenditures, leading to allocation of a greater proportion of government resources to long-gestation period projects such as infrastructure. This hypothesis can be tested using data generated by a `natural experiment' in the early part of this century, when a wave of municipal reform transformed the governments of many U. S. cities. Controlling for city and time effects, adoption of Civil Service is found to increase the share of <b>total</b> municipal <b>expenditure</b> <b>allocated</b> to road and sewer investment.

40|$|The study uses average {{data from}} Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2004 in Syria to examine monthly {{household}} expenditure on cigarettes and tobacco and its relationships {{with a group}} of socioeconomic variables. It is found that this expenditure increases by average household income. This increase, however, is relatively small; the percent of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>allocated</b> to smoking is much higher among the poor compared to the rich. Expenditure on smoking is negatively affected by the improvements in educational conditions. Household expenditure on domestic cigarettes does not vary by household income; it is positively correlated with characteristics of the place of residence, particularly with illiteracy, polygamy; and negatively with developed educational structure. Expenditure on foreign cigarettes is spread mostly in governorate centers and among rich households. The study deduces that people with low income cannot smoke unless they decrease their monthly expenditure on basic requirements. In order to decrease smoking, two recommendations are made, developing the educational structure and eradicating illiteracy and launching concentrated campaigns to raise awareness against smoking.

40|$|Background. Oral {{diseases}} are amongst the costliest in Australia. Oral Health expenditure is the sixth highest health cost and accounts for 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>allocated</b> health <b>expenditure</b> ($ 3. 4 billion). Decreased productivity, days lost {{at work and}} school increase the community burden. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2011, ~ 49 % of Australian children aged 6 had caries experience in their deciduous teeth and this is rising. The aetiology of dental caries involves a complex interplay of individual, behavioural, social, economic, political and environmental conditions, and there is renewed interest in genetic predisposition. The ongoing Griffith University Birth Cohort Study provides a valuable opportunity to investigate genetic and acquired risk factors by examination of enrolled children and their parents. Objectives. To quantify risk factors for dental caries in a population of Queensland children: social; environmental; behavioural; physiological and inherited. Methods. The Oral Health Sub-study began in November 2012 by examining mothers and their 6 year old children, these being the first (2006) birth cohort: examination of subsequent years is progressing. Detailed questionnaire data of families is available and new primary data on knowledge, attitudes and practices towards oral health are gathered. Height, waist circumference and stride length of mother and child are measured. They are weighed with an electronic Bio-Impedance balance, thereby recording body fat, body water and body mass index. Caries is scored using the International Caries Detection and Scoring system (ICDAS II, 2007). Saliva is collected for physiological measures and DNA extracted for genetic studies. A pilot of the latter concentrates on potential epigenetic markers of risk based on methylation sequencing on the Roche SeqCap Capture platform. Results. Results of the first 52 mother/child dyads shows significant correlations between the child's caries experience and the mother's level of salivary Mutans Streptocci (p= 0. 01), mothers' caries experience (p= 0. 01) and mothers' BMI (p= 0. 05). Conclusion. The correlations found so far between maternal and child oral health indicators and disease experience give confidence in the protocol, justifying the search for genetic influences.

40|$|Economic theory {{predicts that}} money is an {{important}} determinant of macroeconomic variables but fails to clearly define which assets should be considered money. Benjamin Friedman (1984) rejected {{the hypothesis that the}} major monetary aggregates move closely together over substantial periods of time. Thus, the central bank cannot simply pick one monetary aggregate, target it appropriately, and ignore mixed signals. Separability of preferences provides an explicit criteria for determining which assets should be considered as money. An aggregate based on separability will satisfy two properties. First, the total amount of the aggregate desired can be determined independent {{of the size of the}} aggregate's individual components. Second, changes in the relative size of the aggregate's components which leave the aggregate's total unchanged will not affect the choice of other assets and commodities. These properties indicate that an aggregate based on separability will have a more stable relationship with GNP than any other aggregate. Barnett (1980) first argued this proposition. Separability imposes structure on the Hessian matrix. Imagine a partition of the n goods of the choice set into m groups. If preferences are separable in this partition, the marginal rate of substitution between any pair of goods in the same group is independent of the level of consumption of any good which is not an element of that group. The result is two-level Hessian matrix corresponding to the partition. Theil translates this Hessian matrix into a two-level Rotterdam demand model. This model first <b>allocates</b> <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> among groups of goods. Next, each group allocation is allocated among the group's individual components. This two-level demand model permits the testing of alternate hypotheses regarding separable partitions of the choice set. Three separate partitions of choice set were tested. Each was rejected. Thus, the data do not support using separability to define a monetary aggregate for policy purposes...|$|R
40|$|En los últimos años se ha incrementado el interés por estudiar el endeudamiento de las Administraciones Públicas, ya que existe el convencimiento generalizado de que el nivel que ha alcanzado dicho endeudamiento es excesivo. En este contexto, el presente trabajo pretende analizar las {{variables}} que mejor explican el endeudamiento en uno de los tres niveles en que se divide el sector público en España: el sector autonómico. Para ello hemos utilizado variables de tipo económico, fundamentalmente presupuestarias, así como otras variables de tipo institucional. Entre los resultados obtenidos destaca que las Comunidades Autónomas con mayores competencias tienen mayores niveles de endeudamiento. También el PIB generado y el gasto total destinado a transferencias parecen variables que originan diferencias en el nivel de endeudamiento. En contra de lo que cabría esperar, los gastos de capital tienen escasa incidencia en el stock de deuda de las diferentes Comunidades Autónomas.

The generated GDP and the <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>allocated</b> to transfers also appear to be variables that cause differences in the level of indebtedness.
