5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the storm, the name Bess was retired and {{replaced}} with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. Coincidentally, it was again retired in 1982 when a powerful storm named Bess caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
50|$|The allies will exact {{from this}} Government payment of the {{expenses}} of the war which they have seen themselves obliged to accept, as well as reparation <b>and</b> indemnification for <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>and</b> injuries caused to their public and private properties, and to the persons of their citizens, without express declaration of war, <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>and</b> injuries committed subsequently {{in violation of the}} principles which govern the laws of war.|$|R

5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> other effects of the event. This has not always been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey <b>the</b> <b>damage,</b> <b>and</b> return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused {{the hull of}} the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> flown to Carnarvon.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren {{with orders}} to {{organize}} a survey team to report on <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> radioactivity at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A party equipped with portable Geiger counters arrived in Hiroshima on 8 September headed by Farrell and Warren, with Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. This and other scientific missions to Japan would provide valuable scientific and historical data.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would be needed to repair <b>the</b> <b>damage,</b> <b>and</b> the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
25|$|In January 1996 Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} {{a fire and}} found to be plagued by fungus and rot.

5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to dismantle the Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings in the south of France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> suffering done to France.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Xangsane's final landfall, the Vietnamese {{government}} {{set up a}} {{steering committee}} headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyễn Sinh Hùng to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam. Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300,000people from low-lying areas along the coast from Hà Tĩnh to Phú Yên, as well as hilly areas prone to landslides. The Vietnamese government also ordered about 2,400 boats, including 273 fishing boats, to return to port. Vietnam Airlines, the national airline, cancelled or diverted all flights on September 30 and October 1. These efforts were carried out {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> fatalities caused by Typhoon Chanchu earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out. Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while {{the purchase of the}} Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E

5|$|The Earls of Morton {{continued}} to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier high status. In 1688 the castle was badly damaged by fire, and in 1690 the 11th Earl consulted the architect James Smith. Smith surveyed <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> drew up proposals for repairing and extending the castle with another wing north of the east range. The Earl also sought estimates for the demolition of the tower house and central range. Nothing ever came of these proposals, although repairs were carried out to the east range, being completed in 1703.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi and Alabama coastlines {{suffered}} catastrophic {{damage from}} the storm's 30-foot (9m) storm surge. New Orleans escaped the worst {{damage from the}} storm, but levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 17th Street and London Avenue Canals were ultimately breached by storm surge, flooding about 80% of the city. 1,836people were confirmed dead across seven US states. Katrina is the costliest {{and one of the}} deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history, with damage totals around US$81.2billion ($ USD).
