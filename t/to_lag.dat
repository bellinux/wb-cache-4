5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

5|$|At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers {{secured the}} license to publish home {{conversions}} of the Q*bert arcade game. Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600, {{and by the}} end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, the Atari 8-bit computer family, Commodore VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and Commodore 64. The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop electronic game. It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item. Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.|$|E
5|$|Poland {{suffered}} catastrophic {{damage to}} its infrastructure during the war, which caused it <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> even further behind the West in its industrial output. The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to over 30% of the pre-war potential. Poland's capital of Warsaw {{was among the}} most devastated cities – over 80 percent destroyed {{in the aftermath of the}} Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Nonetheless, resulting from forced migration, there was a rapid increase in population to 23.9 million shown in the first post-war census of 14 February 1946. The Polish state acquired more highly developed western territories and lost the more economically backward eastern regions. Already in 1948 the prewar level of industrial production was exceeded in global and per capita terms during the first Three-Year Plan (Plan Trzyletni) fueled by the collective desire to rebuild shattered lives.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E

25|$|Although the Russian Empire {{would play}} a leading {{political}} role as late as 1848, its retention of serfdom precluded economic progress of any significant degree. As West European economic growth accelerated during the Industrial Revolution, sea trade and colonialism which had begun {{in the second half}} of the 18th century, Russia began <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> ever farther behind, undermining its ability to field strong armies.|$|E
25|$|Malinovsky hastily {{rushed the}} 48th Guards Rifle Division and two {{anti-tank}} artillery regiments {{forward from the}} front reserve, and the 82nd Guards and 152nd Rifle Divisions were concentrated to defend the city. The German counterattack ran out of steam, but the 8th Guards Army was significantly weakened due to bad road conditions causing its artillery and tanks <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind, as well as ammunition shortages. On 10 February the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps was withdrawn to the reserve in the Apostolovo area due to losses.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{much remains}} to be achieved. According to survey data {{analyzed}} by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. Progress in rural areas appears <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind what has been achieved in urban areas. According to data presented by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation.|$|E

25|$|Many Māori {{migrated}} to larger rural {{towns and cities}} during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban Māori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among Māori, they continued <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind Pākehā {{in areas such as}} health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. Māori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to {{the same time period}} in 2011. As the holiday shopping season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued <b>to</b> <b>lag,</b> even as Apple reported brisk sales. The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features. This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region, as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, 90 {{percent of the}} urban {{population}} of the United States had electric power, in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies {{did not feel that}} extending power to rural areas (rural electrification) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance {{requires}} sufficient servers and bandwidth, and {{a dedicated}} support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> and frustration for the players, and can severely damage {{the reputation of}} a game, especially at launch. Care {{must also be taken}} to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.|$|E
25|$|In June 1916 the British {{preliminary}} bombardment cut much of {{the barbed}} wire protecting the Mametz defences and destroyed many of the trenches in the first position occupied by Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division. When the 7th Division advanced behind a creeping barrage, {{much of the}} German front line was quickly overrun and many prisoners taken; delays further forward caused the infantry <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind the barrage and suffer far more casualties. Mametz was occupied during the morning by the 20th Brigade but a German counter-attack forced most of the British troops out, until a second attack during the afternoon, when the advance of the 18th (Eastern) Division on the right flank, had cut the Germans in the village off from Montauban to the east. The German defence collapsed and the 7th Division reached all its objectives {{on the right and}} in the centre and began to consolidate, ready to receive a German counter-attack.|$|E
25|$|The land reform, {{implemented}} by Sfatul Țării in 1918–1919, {{resulted in a}} rise of a middle class, as 87% of the region's population lived in rural areas. The reform was however marred by {{the small size of}} the awarded plots, as well as by preferential allotment of land to politicians and administrative personnel who had supported the political goals of the Romanian government. Generally, urban development and industry were insignificant, and the region remained primarily an agrarian rural region throughout the interwar period. Certain improvements were achieved in the area of education, the literacy rate rising from 15.6% in 1897 to 37% by 1930; however, Bessarabia continued <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> behind the rest of the country, the national literacy rate being 60%. During the inter-war period, Romanian authorities also conducted a program of Romanianization that sought to assimilate ethnic minorities throughout the country. The enforcement of this policy was especially pervasive in Bessarabia due to its highly diverse population, and resulted in the closure of minority educational and cultural institutions.|$|E
