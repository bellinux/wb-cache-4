25|$|Idiosyncratic (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause non-predictable {{hepatotoxicity}} in susceptible individuals, {{which is}} not related to dose and has a variable latency period. This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor <b>temporal</b> <b>relationship,</b> and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; Troglitazone (Rezulin) and trovafloxacin (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it is the}} {{summation}} of the action potentials that eventually results in the threshold polarization being crossed, the <b>temporal</b> <b>relationship</b> of different input signals {{is very important in}} determining if and when a post-synaptic neuron will fire. Over time, the time it takes an action potential to propagate down the length of a particular axon can change. In one experiment multielectrode arrays were used to measure the time it took for action potentials to travel from one electrode to another, called latency. The neurons were then stimulated and the value of the latency was recorded over time. The latency values changed over time, suggesting that axonal plasticity influenced the propagation of action potentials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multimedia presentations {{comprise}} various media {{objects such}} as text, audio, image, and video that are delivered to users according to certain <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships.</b> In stored multimedia presentations, these <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> are explicitly formulated by the author(s) and stored along with the presentations. However, {{it is difficult to}} ensure that these <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> are always strictly preserved in real-time, distributed multimedia presentations. This {{is due to the fact}} that various components of the run-time environment such as operating system and network may offer only best effort services, i. e., they may not be able to provide any real-time guarantees. In this paper, we survey the different approaches that can be used for adapting multimedia presentations to handle instances where <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> cannot be preserved in a strict manner. We classify these approaches into three categories and discuss when these categories of adaptations can be used...|$|R

2500|$|Evidence for {{depression}} being causally associated with isotretinoin use includes 41 reports of positive challenge/dechallenge/rechallenge with isotretinoin, involving administering isotretinoin, withdrawing {{the drug and}} then re-administering it. The majority of these cases had no psychiatric history. [...] Bremner et al. state that [...] "these examples of depression resulting from isotretinoin use ... make for a very strong case for their link in some individuals." [...] There is also a <b>temporal</b> <b>relationship</b> between development of depression and initiation of isotretinoin treatment, with most cases developing after 1–2 months of treatment. Further, higher doses of isotretinoin {{increases the risk of}} developing depression, with 25% of patients showing depression on a dose of 3mg/kg/day as compared with 3-4% at normal doses.|$|E
2500|$|The key {{variables}} for gait are the duty factor and the forelimb-hindlimb phase relationship. Duty factor {{is simply the}} {{percent of the total}} cycle which a given foot is on the ground. [...] This value will usually be the same for forelimbs and hindlimbs unless the animal is moving with a specially trained gait or is accelerating or decelerating. [...] Duty factors over 50% are considered a [...] "walk", while those less than 50% are considered a run. Forelimb-hindlimb phase is the <b>temporal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the limb pairs. [...] If the same-side forelimbs and hindlimbs initiate stance phase at the same time, the phase is 0 (or 100%). [...] If the same-side forelimb contacts the ground half of the cycle later than the hindlimb, the phase is 50%.|$|E

40|$|New {{techniques}} {{are necessary to}} satisfy the high bandwidth requirement and <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> of multimedia data streams in a network environment. Clients can experience gaps between the multimedia data streams during presentations as the multimedia server services multiple clients. This variable delay occurs {{between the end of}} one multimedia stream {{and the beginning of the}} next multimedia stream because client requests are queued awaiting service. This leads to interruptions and discontinuities of the client's presentation. Special {{techniques are}} necessary to manage the <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between multimedia streams in distributed environments. In this paper we propose two scheduling algorithms for delivering multimedia streams by using the query script, which is a multimedia database interface for clients. A client can specify all the multimedia objects that make up the presentation and their <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> in a query script. Once submitted, the information in the query script is used by the multimedia database system to schedule and optimize delivery. Using simulations we analyzed the performance of the proposed delivery scheduling algorithms and the predelivery optimization method. The simulation results show that delivery scheduling algorithms satisfy the specied <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between multimedia streams while maintaining better use of system resources...|$|R

We then demonstrate the ensuing reasoning capabilities on a task that involves recognizing football plays. Finally, we discuss the implications of our temporal representation and reasoning mechanisms for the larger architecture...|$|R

30|$|Tracking {{segments}} by the intersections {{of their}} traces has several advantages: (a) it implicitly handles cases where segments split and merge; (b) when temporal window sizes of w[*]>[*] 1 are used, <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> over several frames (maximum w) {{can be established}} (in each direction). This enables the tracking of a segment {{even when it is}} missed for a few frames and then reappears; (c) from the <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> established by trace intersection, we can derive spatial relationships between segments in the same frame (see Section 3.4. 4).|$|R
30|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between {{signals and}} ground truth can be {{leveraged}} to better prepare training data for classification. Cross correlation (CCR) at different time lags between a signal and attack set highlights any <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships.</b> Pre-processing external signal data with correlation based aggregation methods can magnify {{the effect of}} relevant measurements on classification. Similar to a previous study (Okutan et al. 2017 a), this work suggests to use alternative novel cross correlation based approaches to identify the significant time lags of the unconventional signals for signal aggregation.|$|R
30|$|Trace {{intersection}} {{is performed}} for all segments detected by color classification. The <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> generated by trace intersection {{can be considered}} as a graph. Nodes in the graph are segments which are associated with a particular frame, and the edges in the graph are <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> (links) between segments. The graph is directed since tracing generates forward- and backward-directed links. However, for the subsequent processing the direction of the edges is not important and thus we neglect their orientation. Due to splitting and merging of segments the graph may contain cycles. The density of the graph is dependent on the threshold C used in trace intersection (see Section 3.4. 2). A higher (more stricter) threshold C impedes the creation of links and increases the sparsity of the graph, while a lower value of C facilitates the establishment of <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> and increases the density of the graph.|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a general probabilistic framework for multisensor multi-class object recognition based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) trained with virtual evidence boosting.

We demonstrate the benefits of modelling spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> for the problem of detecting seven classes of objects using laser and vision data in outdoor environments. Additionally, we show how this framework can be used with partially labeled data, thereby significantly reducing the burden of manual data annotation. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the complex predicates in Bangla (Bengali); serial verb constructions (SVCs) and verb compounds (VCs). Based on semantics, syntactic behavior and prosody, I {{claim that the}} predicates belong to two different modules of grammar: SVCs in syntax and VCs in the lexicon. Additionally, I show that clausal tense marked in the last verb of the SVC verb series is distinct from the internal <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between the events. There needs to be different levels of analysis for clausal tense and clause internal <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between the events. ...|$|R

Many contexts require a richer notion of time in which actions can overlap and have different durations. This paper proposes a Temporal Planning System (TPS) that represent actions of different duration for temporal planning in ubiquitous environments. Ubiquitous service agent explores the use of Semantic Web language (i. e., OWL) for defining and publishing a context and for reasoning over such service.

40|$|Multimedia {{applications}} usually {{involve a}} large number of multimedia objects (texts, images, sounds, etc.). An important issue in this context is the specification of spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> among these objects. In this paper we define such a model, based on a set of spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships</b> between objects participating in multimedia applications. Our work exploits existing approaches for spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>relationships.</b> We extend these relationships in order to cover the specific requirements of multimedia applications and we integrate the results in a uniform framework for spatio-temporal composition representation. Another issue is the efficient handling of queries related to the spatio-temporal relationships among the objects during the authoring process. Such queries may be very costly and appropriate indexing schemes are needed so as to handle them efficiently. We propose efficient such schemes, based on multidimensional (spatial) data structures, for large multimedia applications that involve thousands of objects. Evaluation models of the proposed schemes are also presented, as well as hints for the selection of the most appropriate one, according to the multimedia author's requirements...|$|R
