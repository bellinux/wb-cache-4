5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism.

The airframe of Saras-PT2 was built with lighter composites to reduce its overall weight by about 400kg from its first prototype, which was overweight by about 900kg.

25|$|The {{repeated}} rejections by the British of Greek Cypriot {{demands for}} enosis prompted an armed underground campaign by {{a movement of}} Greek Cypriots known as the National Organization of Cypriot Struggle, or EOKA. EOKA, led by the Greek commander George Grivas, systematically targeted British colonial authorities. One {{of the effects of}} the EOKA campaign was to alter the Turkish position from demanding full reincorporation into Turkey to a demand for taksim (partition). The fact that the Turks were a minority was, according to Nihat Erim, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> the transfer of thousands of Turks from mainland Turkey so that the Greek Cypriots would cease to be the majority.

It holds that national judges must carry on a ‘conventionality control', comparing national laws with the Convention and the interpretation of its provisions given by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It also maintains that {{there are two types of}} conventionality control: a narrow one and a broad one, depending on whether the Inter-American Court has already ruled on the matter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>address</b> <b>by</b> the national judge.

25|$|These criticisms {{are also}} voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, {{especially}} self-described democratic transhumanists, {{who believe that}} the majority of current or future social and environmental issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> a combination of political and technological solutions (like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book , argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.|$|E
25|$|In July 1975, Fernandes {{arrived in}} Baroda. There, he met Kirit Bhatt, who was {{president}} of Baroda Union of Journalists, and Vikram Rao, a staff correspondent of The Times of India at Baroda, both who opposed the Emergency. They used to meet and discuss on {{what could be done}} to topple the autocratic Indira Gandhi Government. An industrialist friend, Viren J. Shah, managing director of Mukand Ltd., helped them find contacts for procuring dynamite, used extensively in quarries around Halol (near Baroda). They aimed at blowing up toilets in government offices and cause explosions near the venue of public meetings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> Indira Gandhi. The idea was not to injure anybody, but only create a scare. The explosions were to be carried out either late in the night or hours before the public meeting was to begin to avoid injury. A plan was hatched to blow up a dais four hours before Indira Gandhi was to address a meeting in Varanasi. The conspiracy later {{came to be known as}} the infamous Baroda dynamite case.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with limited}} amounts of {{existing}} relevant information from available sources {{upon which to}} base the aircraft's design, Miles turned {{to the field of}} ballistics instead. He had reasoned that, as it was widely known that bullets could attain supersonic speeds, aerodynamic properties that would enable an aircraft to be capable of becoming supersonic would likely to be present amongst such shapes. In particular, as a result of studying this design data, the emerging aircraft would feature both a conical nose and very thin elliptical wings complete with sharp leading edges. This contrasted against many early jet aircraft, which were furnished with round noses, thick wings and hinged elevators, resulting in these aircraft possessing critical Mach numbers that were below the speed of sound and thus were less suitable for research into high subsonic speeds (in dives) than the earlier Supermarine Spitfire with its thinner wings. In 1943, RAE tests conducted using Spitfires had proved that drag was the main factor that would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> high-speed aircraft.|$|E
