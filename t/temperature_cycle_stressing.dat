The design of setup was based on ensuring a hoop stress in the spool greater than threshold stress for reorientation of hydrides in this alloy, which was achieved by manipulating the thermal expansion coefficient of the plunger and pressure tube material and diametral interference between them.

40|$|Promising {{evidence}} suggests that impaired circadian rhythms can lead to various mood disorders. Circadian rhythms are regulated by a master clock, the hypothalamic superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and its downstream circadian oscillators. Core clock genes compose the circadian clock through a system of feedback loops. A variety of inputs can modulate clock gene expression, such as glucocorticoid hormones, feeding <b>cycles,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and <b>stress.</b> In this study, I investigated the effects of acute stress on {{the expression of the}} core clock gene, Cry 1, in the SCN, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats maintained on a 12 h/ 12 h light-dark <b>cycle.</b> <b>Stress</b> has been shown to induce clock gene expression in various cell lines and tissues. In broad strokes the mechanism of stress induced clock gene expression is unknown. I hypothesized that glucocorticoid response elements (GRE’s) {{may play a role in}} stress induced clock gene expression. When bound by the glucocorticoid hormone-glucocorticoid receptor dimer, GRE’s promote transcription of genes. It has been shown that certain clock genes have GRE’s in their promoter regions. Based on this, I presumed that acute stress could increase clock gene expression in brain regions containing a high density of GR’s, if a functional GRE is present in the promoter region of the clock gene. Furthermore, I examined if there was a time of day effect of Cry 1 mRNA in all three regions of interest, since clock gene expression is variable throughout a 24 -hour period. I also examined whether there was a sex effect in the SCN and PVN, since there are gender differences in the magnitude of the CORT response to acute stress...|$|R

40|$|Circadian rhythms are {{generally}} {{known to be}} entrained to light cycles, and in some poikilothermic animals living in terrestrial region also to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles.</b> The entraining effect of <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> may be attributable {{to the fact that}} the daily fluctuation of temperature on the land is rather clear and regular closely related to the natural light change. On the other hand, the daily fluctuation of temperature in the sea is not so clear as in the terrestrial region, being generally very small or perfectly null depending on the depth.

40|$|The three cyanobacterial Kai {{proteins}} and ATP {{are capable of}} generating an autonomous rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation in a test tube.

We have examined the rhythm under various <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> {{and found that it}} was stably entrained by a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> of 20 – 28 hours. As the period length was not altered by temperature, entrainment by period change could be excluded from possible mechanisms.

Based on the phase response curves of the step-up and step-down in temperature, phase shift by single temperature pulse was estimated using a nonparametric entrainment model (discontinuous phase jump by external stimuli). The predicted phase shift was consistent with the experimentally measured phase shift. Next, successive phase shifts caused by repeated <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> were computed by two phase response curves and compared with actual entrainment of the rhythm.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{state of the}} circadian system of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) differs in several characteristics from the {{functional state}} of normotensive Wistar rats. Some of these changes {{might be due to}} the compromised ability of the central pacemaker to entrain the peripheral clocks. Daily body <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> represent one of the important cues responsible for the integrity of the circadian system, because these cycles are driven by the central pacemaker and are able to entrain the peripheral clocks. This study tested the hypothesis that the aberrant peripheral clock entrainment of SHR results from a compromised peripheral clock sensitivity to the daily <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> resetting. Using cultured Wistar rat and SHR fibroblasts transfected with the circadian luminescence reporter Bmal 1 -dLuc, we demonstrated that two consecutive square-wave <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> with amplitudes of 2. 5 °C are necessary and sufficient to restart the dampened oscillations and entrain the circadian clocks in both Wistar rat and SHR fibroblasts.

Although it {{has long}} been known that <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> can robustly entrain Drosophila locomotor rhythms, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: We show here that <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> induce synchronized behavioral rhythms and oscillations of the clock proteins PERIOD and TIMELESS in constant light, a situation that normally leads to molecular and behavioral arrhythmicity. We show that expression of the Drosophila clock gene period can be entrained by <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> in cultured body parts and isolated brains. Further, we show that the phospholipase C encoded by the norpA gene contributes to thermal entrainment, suggesting that a receptor-coupled transduction cascade signals temperature changes to the circadian clock. We initiated the further genetic dissection of temperature-entrainment and isolated the novel Drosophila mutation nocte, which is defective in molecular and behavioral entrainment by <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> but synchronizes normally to light:dark cycles. Conclusions: We conclude that temperature synchronization of the circadian clock is a tissue-autonomous process that is able to override the arrhythmia-inducing effects of constant light.

This process includes the function of phospholipase C and the product specified by the novel mutation nocte...|$|R
