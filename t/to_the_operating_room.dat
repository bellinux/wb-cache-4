40|$|Objectives: <b>To</b> {{know how}} <b>the</b> nursing {{students}} evaluate the clinical-practical knowledge appraised at their clinical clerkship, measured through the {{satisfaction with the}} nursing staff Teaching Skills, the Perceived Support and their Global Satisfaction. Methodology: Cross-section, descriptive study carried out at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital. The target population were the 2008 / 09 nursing students at their clinical clerkship in the hospital, with a total number of 459 shifts. Questionnaire was self-designed and self-administered. Analyzed variables were the student academic year, the hospital ward and their relation with: 1. Teaching Skills, 2. Perceived Support, 3. General Satisfaction. Results: 314 questionnaires were filled out and returned, which is 69, 41 % {{of the total number}} of questionnaires. Students at <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> and at <b>the</b> Paediatric Wards gave statistically significant lower qualifications (p= 0, 005 and p= 0, 003) than <b>the</b> Emergencies students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nursing staff Teaching Skills. Regarding the Perceived Support, statistically significant higher scores were given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paediatrics (p= 0, 002) and the Surgical Wards (0, 001) compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> staff. Finally, in General Satisfaction the lowest, but non statistically significant, scores were given also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> (p> 0, 05). Conclusions: Nursing staff from <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms</b> and <b>the</b> Paediatric Wards should ameliorate their teaching skills, and those at <b>the</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Rooms,</b> also <b>the</b> support given during the students clinical clerkship. The proposed improvement actions suggest that meetings between supervisors, nursing staff and professors in order <b>to</b> discuss <b>the</b> teaching objectives are necessary, as well as informational sessions between students and nursing staff at the wards...|$|R

25|$|It is {{recommended}} that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks {{is recommended}}. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between {{the risk of death}} and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it {{is recommended that}} steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency caesarean delivery is usually indicated.|$|E

Initially annoyed by Joel's surliness, Ellie starts {{to feel a}} strong attachment to him. After experiencing a traumatizing encounter in the Winter, in which Ellie is nearly raped and murdered by a band of cannibals, she becomes withdrawn and introverted. When Joel finally gets her to the Fireflies, it is discovered {{that she has a}} mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus growing on her brain, which may be used to create a vaccine; in order to extract the fungi, an operation on Ellie's brain is required, that will likely kill her. While she is being prepared for surgery, Joel makes his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> and carries her to safety. When Ellie awakens from unconsciousness, Joel lies by telling her that the Fireflies found many other subjects, and had stopped looking for a cure.

Shepherd is transported to the same hospital at Dillard, with multiple fractures, internal injuries, and loss of speech. His thoughts are verbalized through narration. Shepherd realizes that he needs a CT scan for his head injury, but cannot tell the ER staff. Instead, they transport him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> to address his abdominal injuries. By the time of the surgery, Shepherd is certain that he will die as his hemorrhage will not be discovered in time. One of his doctors, Dr. Penelope Blake (Samantha Sloyan), wants to perform a CT, but is dismissed by an ignorant senior. The hospital's neurosurgeon takes over an hour to arrive, and by the time he arrives Shepherd is already brain dead.

Bacterial colony counts in the presence of decontaminating mats were substantially and statistically significantly reduced compared with the absence of mats. The lower mean number of colony-forming units detected at points located beyond the mats parallels this finding; this difference is also statistically significant.

2500|$|Beck {{realized}} that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase [...] "Hearts {{too good to}} die." [...] In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During {{the closure of the}} large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual heart massage. As he looked at and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E

They were flown to a Nashville Hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months. He received thousands of letters from well-wishers. He returned to music in January 1956, about four months after the injury, but after working [...] a week or so, one of the hips collapsed, and he returned to the hospital for a metal hip to be implanted. Seven years later, the other hip required similar surgery. The first metal hip lasted for some 40 years, but eventually failed, requiring a total hip replacement in October 1996, when he was age 72.

Methods: A case study of 2 patients who had guide wire dilating forceps technique of percutaneous tracheostomy without the aid of a bronchoscope have been reported here.

Results: <b>The</b> mean <b>operating</b> time in both the cases was nearly 6 mins. Both the patients did not have any complications. Both the patients were tracheotomised for permanent indication.

METHODS: A total of 722 infants ≤ 60 weeks postmenstrual age undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy were randomized to either bupivacaine regional anesthesia (RA) or sevoflurane GA. Exclusion criteria included risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome and infants born at &# 60; 26 weeks of gestation.
