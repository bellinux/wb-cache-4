25|$|In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted {{unanimously}} to erect a memorial for the ‘comfort women’ of World War II. The memorial itself would stand {{as a reminder that}} the event did in fact happen, despite repeated denials by the Japanese government, {{and it would be a}} reminder never to let another atrocity like it happen again. However some Japanese members of the community showed concerns over the memorial, believing that it would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community. One of these critics was Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, a large city in Japan. Hashimoto claims in his letter written to the Board of Supervisors that the memorial should be “broadened to memorialize all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world”. Japanese residents of the area have also shown concerns over the memorial as many believe that it projects hatred towards the Japanese and focuses solely on an event in committed by the Japanese during wartime instead of promoting awareness and future prevention.|$|E

500|$|The {{gestation}} of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, {{was only}} slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with [...] "A Career" [...] as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: [...] "'At the Store' {{is a tribute to}} <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.|$|E

40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} are prescribed drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and 561 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %). Contrarily, none of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed a single dose of ceftriaxone had gonorrhoea, whereas 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not had this drug prescribed did have gonorrhoea.

500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E

[...] Emo's popularity and its [...] "lonely boy's aesthetic" [...] have led to a litany of one-sided songs in which men vent their fury at <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> wronged them. Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments with a pop-music veneer.|$|E
