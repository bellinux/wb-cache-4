25|$|In October 2008, Cooper, {{the last}} {{survivor}} of Operation Tracer, returned to Gibraltar with his family. The team that escorted {{them to the}} secret cave complex included Jackson and the Director of the Gibraltar Museum. The event was filmed by Martin Nuza. The retired physician confirmed that the Stay Behind Cave discovered in 1997 was the same covert chamber that had been constructed for his use {{and that of his}} five colleagues. During his visit to Gibraltar, Cooper stayed at the Rock Hotel, the same place he had resided more than sixty years earlier when he first arrived for his covert mission. Other events that had been organised for Dr. Cooper and his family that week included a trip on a Gibraltar Squadron patrol boat, a tour of the World War II tunnels, and his guest appearance at the annual Trafalgar Day ceremony at the Trafalgar Cemetery. Cooper also had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the commander of the British Forces Gibraltar, Commodore Matt Parr. Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander Bruce Cooper died two years later, shortly after his 96th birthday, on 3 December 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Compression is used {{in voice}} {{communications}} in amateur radio that employ SSB modulation. [...] Often {{it is used to}} make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others. [...] This occurs especially in pileups where amateur radio stations are competing for <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a DX station. Since an SSB signal's amplitude depends on the level of modulation, the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal and hence average transmitted power would be stronger than it would be had compression not been used. [...] Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built in.|$|E
2500|$|Council is a codified practice, {{derived from}} ancient traditions,. that {{involves}} bringing individuals {{together in a}} council circle, {{under the guidance of}} a trained facilitator, for a candid and heartfelt conversation.

Participants are encouraged to speak authentically when it’s their turn, and to listen deeply, without comment or judgment, while others are speaking. [...] Intention is focused on the common stories, values, fears and aspirations that make one human, encouraging taking the perspective of the other and finding common ground. [...] Council is a compassion-based attentional practice that fosters greater awareness of self and others and capacity for cultivating skillful communication, respectful relationships and ethical action.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{scholarly}} monograph, Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues, Wendy J. Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives students <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak {{is one way to}} do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E

6000|$|So it {{was that}} the good woman took the trail in hot and righteous wrath, a trail which brought her {{ultimately}} into the company of Mrs. Eppingwell and Floyd Vanderlip. Mrs. Eppingwell had just found <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the man. She had determined, now that Flossie was so near at hand, to proceed directly to the point, and an incisive little ethical discourse was titillating on the end of her tongue, when the couple became three.

60|$|Julian Peveril had so {{fixed his}} affections, as {{to insure the}} fullest share of that {{opposition}} which early attachments are so apt to encounter. Yet nothing so natural as {{that he should have}} done so. In early youth, Dame Debbitch had accidentally met with the son of her first patroness, and who had himself been her earliest charge, fishing in the little brook already noticed, which watered the valley in which she resided with Alice Bridgenorth. The dame's curiosity easily discovered who he was; and besides the interest which persons in her condition usually take in the young people who have been under their charge, she was delighted with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about former times--about Martindale Castle, and friends there--about Sir Geoffrey and his good lady--and, now and then, about Lance Outram the park-keeper.|$|E
6000|$|It is true {{that the}} gondolier loves best of {{everything}} a clamorous quarrel, carried on with the canal between him and his antagonist; but next to this, he loves to spend his leisure at the ferry in talking of eating and of money, and he does not differ from many of his fellow- citizens in choice of topics. I have seldom caught a casual expression from passers in the streets of Venice which did not relate in some way to gold Napoleons, zwanzigers, florins, or soldi, or else to wine and polenta. I note this trait in the Venetians, which Goldoni observed in the Milanese a hundred years ago, and which I incline to believe is common to all Italians. The gondoliers talk a great deal in figure and hyperbole, and their jocose chaff is quite inscrutable even to some classes of Venetians. With foreigners, to whom the silence and easy progress of the gondola gives them <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> they are fond of using a word or two of French. They are quick at repartee, and have a clever answer ready for most occasions. I was one day bargaining for a boat to the Lido, whither I refused to be taken in a shabby gondola, or at a rate higher than seventy-five soldi for the trip. At last the patience of the gondoliers was exhausted, and one of them called out, [...] "Somebody fetch the Bucintoro, and take this gentleman to the Lido for seventy-five soldi!" [...] (The Bucintoro being the magnificent barge in which the Doge went to wed the Adriatic.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wondered}} whether you wouldn't {{read it to}} me," [...] said Mrs. Alsager, as they lingered a little near the fire before he took leave. She {{looked down at the}} fire sideways, drawing her dress away from it and making her proposal with a shy sincerity that added to her charm. Her charm was always great for Allan Wayworth, and the whole air of her house, which was simply a sort of distillation of herself, so soothing, so beguiling that he always made several false starts before departure. He had spent some such good hours there, had forgotten, in her warm, golden drawing-room, so much of the loneliness and so many of the worries of his life, that it had come to be the immediate answer to his longings, the cure for his aches, the harbour of refuge from his storms. His tribulations were not unprecedented, and some of his advantages, if of a usual kind, were marked in degree, inasmuch as he was very clever for one so young, and very independent for one so poor. He was eight-and-twenty, but he had lived a good deal and was full of ambitions and curiosities and disappointments. <b>The</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of some of these in Grosvenor Place corrected perceptibly the immense inconvenience of London. This inconvenience took for him principally the line of insensibility to Allan Wayworth's literary form. He had a literary form, or he thought he had, and her intelligent recognition of the circumstance was the sweetest consolation Mrs. Alsager could have administered. She was even more literary and more artistic than he, inasmuch as he could often work off his overflow (this was his occupation, his profession), while the generous woman, abounding in happy thoughts, but unedited and unpublished, stood there in the rising tide like the nymph of a fountain in the plash of the marble basin.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{only the}} {{conspiracy}} of hindrances so perpetually characteristic of life in this place, {{even when it is}} theoretically not alive, as in the mid-August, that has stayed my hand, for days past, when it has most longed to write to you. Dear Lowell's death--the words are almost as difficult as they are odious to write--has made me think almost as much of you as of him. I imagine that you are the person in the world to whom it makes the most complete and constant difference that he is no longer here; just as you must have been the one most closely associated with the too vain watching of his last struggle with the monster. It is a dim satisfaction to me, therefore, to say to you how fond I was of him and how I shall miss him and miss him and miss him. During these last strange English years of his life (it would take me long to tell you why I call them strange,) I had seen a great deal of him, and all with the effect of confirming my affection for him. London is bestrewn, to my sense, with reminders of his happy career here, and his company and his talk. He was kind and delightful and gratifying to me, and all sorts of occasions in which he will ever be vivid swarm before me as I think of him.... Strange was his double existence--the American and the English sides of his medal, which had yet so much in common. That is, I don't know how English he was at home, but he was conspicuously American here. However, I am not trying to characterize him, to you least of all who had known him well so much longer and seen all, or most, of the chapters of his history; but only letting you see how much I wish we might talk of him together. Some day we will, though it's a date that seems unfixable now. I am taking for granted ... that you inherit the greatest of literary responsibilities to his memory. I think of this as a very high interest, but also a very arduous labour. It's a blessing, however, to feel that such an office is in such hands as yours. The posthumous vulgarities of our day add another grimness to death. Here again is another matter as to which I really miss not having <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you. This is a brief communication, my dear Charles, for I am literally catching a train. I go down to the Isle of Wight half an hour hence....|$|E
