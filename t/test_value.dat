Note that U is defined here according to the classic definition as the smaller of the two U values which can be computed from the data. This ensures that 2U < n1n2, as n1n2 is the maximum value of the U statistics.|$|E

However, the design of a complex pressure containment system involves much more than the application of this formula. For almost all pressure vessels, the ASME code stipulates the requirements for design and testing. Prior to delivery, the pressure vessel is hydrostatically tested at 130% of its rated pressure under the supervision of an ASME code inspector. It is filled with water, and a small pump raises the pressure to the necessary <b>test</b> <b>value,</b> at which it is held for a specified time (30 minutes according to the ASME code).

50|$|In {{some other}} {{problems}} {{in the design and}} analysis of algorithms, doubly exponential sequences are used within the design of an algorithm rather than in its analysis. An example is Chan's algorithm for computing convex hulls, which performs a sequence of computations using test values hi = 22i (estimates for the eventual output size), taking time O(n log hi) for each <b>test</b> <b>value</b> in the sequence. Because of the double exponential growth of these test values, the time for each computation in the sequence grows singly exponentially as a function of i, and the total time is dominated by the time for the final step of the sequence. Thus, the overall time for the algorithm is O(n log h) where h is the actual output size.|$|E

Many laboratories compare paediatric results to adult reference ranges or to published paediatric reference ranges {{that may not be}} specific for the test used. This can lead to misdiagnosis or over-diagnosis of blood clotting disorders as many proteins exist at levels during stages of infancy that would be associated with disease in adults. This can lead to unnecessary stress for families and can have significant medical implications for the child (e.g. further testing). The differences in the haemostatic proteins can lead to different interactions with anticoagulant drugs that are used to prevent and treat thrombosis in children. More studies are required to determine the optimal treatment strategies and doses of anticoagulants in children.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom {{has since}} 1971 had {{well-established}} slip resistance standards {{based on the}} pendulum. This test was developed for pedestrian traction by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the 1940s and further refined in the UK. It was validated for pedestrian traction in 1971, together with its safety standards, in the UK {{over a period of}} 25 years by 3500 real-world public walking area tests and site accident records. The test is an ASTM standard (E 303), slightly modified for pedestrian traction. The usual safety standard for a level floor is a minimum Pendulum <b>Test</b> <b>Value</b> (PTV) of 36. The pendulum is also the instrument used in the Sustainable Slip Resistance test method, which measures the possible impact of years of use on a potential flooring's slip resistance. The pendulum is also used in the U.S. and elsewhere for determining the slipperiness of roads and airport runways.|$|E
50|$|Typically, about 85 {{percent of}} the loss in slip {{resistance}} after 5000 cycles has already occurred after 500cycles. Depending on the flooring buyer’s situation, the flooring might be considered to have Sustainable Slip Resistance for a level floor if (for example) the wet Pendulum <b>Test</b> <b>Value</b> (PTV) is 35 or higher after abrasion for 500 cycles. The 500-cycle result in the laboratory has been found by in situ pendulum tests to be roughly equivalent to 6-12 months of wear in customer areas at a busy McDonald's Restaurant. The 500-cycle specification was adopted by McDonald’s in Australia in October 2006. Other major property owners such as Aldi, Toyota, Westfield and a major cruise ship company have adopted similar specifications. In the USA, flooring with SSR is available in ceramic tile, natural stone, and resilient products. Abrasive-containing coatings, some transparent, are also available that have SSR.|$|E
