5000|$|A version {{known as}} Security Torx, Tamper-Resistant Torx (often {{shortened}} to Torx TR) or pin-in Torx contains a {{post in the}} center of the head that prevents a standard <b>Torx</b> <b>driver</b> (or a straight screwdriver) from being inserted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{on older}} Torx heads {{is that the}} smaller internal [...] "splines" [...] can corrode relatively easily and cause the <b>Torx</b> <b>driver</b> to slip and damage the head, {{making it more difficult}} to remove than the traditional hexagon head.|$|E
5000|$|A {{modified}} version of Torx called Torx TTAP was developed in 2005, which features a second recess to create a [...] "stick-fit" [...] engagement, designed to minimize wobbling {{without the need for}} magnetic bits, a feature that can be important to certain industrial users. Standard <b>Torx</b> <b>drivers</b> can be used to drive TTAP screws, but TTAP drivers will not fit standard Torx screws.|$|R
5000|$|A Torx successor, Torx Plus, was {{introduced}} about 1990 {{when the original}} Torx patent was expiring. The lobes are more square to allow for higher torque and to minimize wear. The name is shortened to IP (Internal Plus) with sizes ranging from 1IP to 100IP [...] (sometimes listed as IP1 to IP100 [...] ) and EP (External Plus) with sizes ranging from 1EP to 42EP as well as smaller sizes ranging from H7EP to H2EP and includes five-lobed tamper-resistant variants. The specifications for these licenses are held by Textron. Standard <b>Torx</b> <b>drivers</b> {{can be used to}} drive Torx Plus screws, but not to full torque because of the loose fit. <b>Torx</b> Plus <b>drivers</b> will not fit into standard Torx screws.|$|R
5000|$|Torx head {{sizes are}} {{described}} using the capital letter [...] "T" [...] {{followed by a}} number ranging from T1 to T100. [...] A smaller number corresponds to a smaller point-to-point dimension of the screw head (diameter of circle circumscribed on the cross-section of {{the tip of the}} screw driver). Common sizes include T10, T15, and T25, while T5.5, T35, and T47 tend to see specialized use. Only the proper driver can drive a specific head size without risk of damaging the driver or screw. The same series of <b>Torx</b> <b>drivers</b> is used to drive SAE, metric and other thread system fasteners, reducing the number of bit sizes required.|$|R
50|$|Some devices contain {{non-standard}} screws or bolts in {{an attempt}} to deter access. Examples are telephone switching cabinets (which have triangular bolt heads that a hex socket fits) and computer hard drives, which usually have a star-shaped head for the screws, known as <b>Torx</b> heads. <b>Drivers</b> for these heads are commonly available from electronics retailers.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>Torx</b> {{and other}} <b>drivers</b> have become widely {{available}} to the consumer due to their increasing use in the industry. Some other styles fit a three-pointed star recess, and a five-lobed spline with rounded edges instead of the square edges of the Torxâ„¢. This is called a Pentalobe.|$|R
