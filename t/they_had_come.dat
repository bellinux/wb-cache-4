5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E

5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson.

Martinez was one of {{just a handful of}} candidates mentioned for the open managerial job.

5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} to {{literary}} knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū as a wedding gift in 1649.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to grips with the physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Sailing {{south toward}} {{the island of}} Mindanao, López de Legazpi's fleet {{encountered}} highwinds forcing them to sail northward to the island of Bohol. There, he captured a vessel from Borneo whose Malay sailors informed the Spaniards that the natives inhabiting the region traded with people from Borneo and Indonesia. Arriving in Bohol, López de Legazpi noticed the hostility of the people. The Malayan servant explained that such hostility {{was due to the}} expeditions conducted by the Portuguese from the Moluccas islands. In 1563, Portuguese fleets arrived in Visayan waters and enslaved about 1,000 inhabitants. López de Legazpi, {{with the help of the}} Malayan sailor, explained to the tribes in Bohol that they were not Portuguese and that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the islands to trade. Upon learning this, the chieftains and their tribes became friendlier and welcoming to the Spaniards.|$|E

5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. It is also true, however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E
5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled to Mexico with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to Mexico to get married. Under the legal terms of her bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After crossing the border, the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again as husband and wife. Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant that the couple now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E
5|$|On November 28, Montgomery and 300 {{men went}} aboard {{some of the}} {{captured}} ships and began to sail to Quebec City. On December 2, Montgomery joined Benedict Arnold's force at Pointe aux Trembles, 18 miles upriver from Quebec. On his arrival, Arnold turned over command of his forces to Montgomery. On December 3, Montgomery gave Arnold's men, who had marched through the Maine wilderness to Quebec City and suffered much hardship along the way, much-needed supplies, including clothing and other winter supplies taken from the captured British ships. The next day, the army moved toward the city; when they arrived, Montgomery ordered the city to be surrounded. On December 7, Montgomery sent an ultimatum to Carleton, demanding the surrender of the city. Carleton burned the letter. Several days later, Montgomery sent a letter into the city appealing the merchants telling them that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to liberate the civilians of Quebec. However, Carleton discovered the plan and quickly had the messenger arrested. Montgomery, wanting his message to reach {{the inhabitants of the}} city, then sent the proclamation over the wall with bows and arrows.|$|E

They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) who {{was sitting in the}} same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.|$|E
