500|$|Four battalions of rebel troops moved {{before dawn}} from the Mekong Delta towards Saigon, using armored {{personnel}} carriers and jeeps carrying machine guns. After cowing several police checkpoints {{on the edge of}} the capital with threats of machine-gun and artillery fire, the plotters put rebel sentries in their place to seal off Saigon from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital, including the post office, to prevent messages from being sent in or out. As his troops took over the city, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and placidly said [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> 4 p.m." [...] He said [...] "This is nothing to worry about. Just a little operation against some politicians." [...] The rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Duong Ngoc Lam, who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh. Lam had commanded the Civil Guard during Diệm's presidency and was one of his trusted supporters.|$|E

After cowing a police checkpoint {{on the edge of}} the capital, they put sentries in their place to seal off Saigon [...] from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital. As the rebel troops took over the city without any firing and sealed it off, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and calmly said, [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> 4 p.m." [...] Claiming to represent The Council for the Liberation of the Nation, Phát proclaimed the deposal of Khánh's [...] "junta" [...] over national radio, and accused Khánh of promoting conflict within the nation's military and political leadership. He promised to capture Khánh and pursue a policy of increased anti-communism, stronger government and military. Phát stated he would return to the crypto-fascist, Catholic integrist ideology of the Ngô family to lay the foundation for his junta. According to historian George McTurnan Kahin, Phát's broadcast was [...] "triumphant" [...] and may have prompted senior officers who were neither part of the original conspiracy nor fully loyal to Khánh to conclude that Phát and Đức would not embrace them if they rallied to their side.|$|E

6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> three I {{called on}} Lord Derby and {{remained}} with [...] him above three hours, in {{prosecution of the}} correspondence which [...] had passed between us.|$|E

6000|$|... 'What are {{you doing}} in there, Bradshaw? Why were you not in school <b>this</b> <b>afternoon?</b> Come out <b>at</b> once.' This in deep and thrilling tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I think so, {{some time}} <b>this</b> <b>afternoon,</b> say <b>at</b> three o'clock. Is that your little daughter? What a lovely child she is. Well, I will look in again about twelve. All that you require {{to do now}} is to keep quiet and rub in some arnica." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to <b>this</b> room to-morrow <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> 6 o'clock {{with the}} landlord, the Populist Candidate, {{and any other}} {{witnesses}} elected from both parties, and I will return the socks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{telegram}} has just arrived," [...] said Lord Emsworth, [...] "to {{say that they}} are being married <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> a registrar's. The whole occurrence is most disturbing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought I spotted {{you once}} or twice before; but you took no notice of me, and I {{reckoned}} I was mistaken. But <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> the Temple of Music"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do with it? why, ride on it, of course. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' {{or rather}} 'lady and gentleman.' Attention! You will both be in marching, or rather in sailing, order by four <b>this</b> <b>afternoon,</b> for <b>at</b> five we {{start for the}} Canaries.

6000|$|... "I have to {{make some}} calls <b>this</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Mark. <b>At</b> seven <b>this</b> evening I will look in at your lodgings, and you shall go along with me to Ingleston's in St. Giles'.

6000|$|... "Miss Gwilt {{reached the}} cottage <b>this</b> <b>afternoon,</b> sir, <b>at</b> {{the time when}} I told you she would reach it, {{and she would have}} joined us at the time I told you she would come, but for Mrs. Milroy. Mrs. Milroy sent for her upstairs as soon as she entered the house, and kept her upstairs a good half-hour and more. That was Miss Gwilt's excuse, Mr. Armadale, for being late at the Mere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've heard, I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield's death? Yes--died <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> five," [...] said Mr. Vatt. Chalkfield was the Councilman who {{had succeeded}} to the Mayoralty in the {{preceding}} November.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{see what}} is wanting! The curate, and the school chapel, and the cottages; and if the school is not enlarged, {{they will have a}} school board. And what am I to say to Miss Parsons? I promised to bring mother's answer about the curate <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> latest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Jethway. And {{the cottage}} {{we are taking}} her to is her own. She is a widow; and I was {{speaking}} to her only <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> I was <b>at</b> Castle Boterel post-office, and she came there to post a letter. Poor soul! Let us hurry on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must tell}} you, Connie," [...] began Merton, {{as soon as}} they were seated, for he had {{forgotten}} all about the other subject by this time, [...] "that when I met Eden <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> he <b>at</b> once agreed to accompany me home to make your acquaintance, and take pot-luck with us. Of course I have told him all about our present circumstances, that we are not settled yet, and living in a kind of Bohemian fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{bought two}} cows <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> That trader <b>at</b> Nogi died of fever, [...] and I bought them from his partner, Sam Willis his name is, who agrees [...] to deliver them--most likely by the Minerva {{next time she}} is down [...] that way. Berande has been long enough on tinned milk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur de Luynes," [...] said my {{companion}} softly, [...] "I fear that I have done {{you a great}} injustice.

6000|$|... "Now, Rollo," [...] said Mr. George, {{after they}} had {{finished}} breakfast, [...] "the great church {{of the city is}} St. Paul's, and that of the West End is Westminster Abbey.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir. The {{uniform and}} the tent are both ready. I have a cork bed, and {{waterproof}} sheet to lay under it; and, I think, everything that I can possibly require.

6000|$|... "Say, pop, {{you know}} that old Mexican lion they call the 'Gotch-eared Devil'--the one that killed Gonzales, Mr. Martin's sheep herder, and about fifty calves on the Salado range? Well, I settled his hash <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> over <b>at</b> the White Horse Crossing. Put two balls in his head with my [...] .38 {{while he was on}} the jump. I knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old Gonzales cut off with his machete. You couldn't have made a better shot yourself, daddy." ...|$|R
50|$|Pitching was prime as Gibson and Santiago {{seemed to}} have their best stuff for <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> game <b>at</b> Fenway Park. The Cards got on the board {{in the top of}} the third on a lead-off single to center by Lou Brock, a double by Curt Flood, and a Roger Maris ground-out to first scoring Brock from third. The Sox came right back to tie the score in the bottom of the same inning. After Gibson (Bob) struck out Gibson (catcher, Russ), Santiago helped his own cause by homering to left-center field.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{pulled up}} {{before one of}} the handsomest houses in London. Douglas, brought back suddenly to the present, realised that <b>this</b> wonderful <b>afternoon</b> was <b>at</b> an end. The stopping of the carriage seemed to him, in a sense, symbolical. The interlude was over. He must {{go back to his}} brooding land of negatives.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must first}} remind your Majesty that I {{was so far}} honoured as to have an {{appointment}} <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>At</b> four o'clock I had your royal promise that you would come to me.

6000|$|... “General Kent’s {{division}} is being disembarked <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> Juragua, {{and this will}} be continued during the night. The assistance of the navy has been of the greatest benefit and enthusiastically given; without them I could not have landed in ten days, and perhaps not at all, as I believe I should have lost so many boats in the surf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Archie, do you {{cause the}} `assembly' to be sounded, and send off your runners in all {{directions}} to bid every man who can be collected to gather here <b>this</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>at</b> three o clock. If foul play has been done we can avenge, although we are too late to save, and, by Heavens, a full and bloody revenge will I take." ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{those two}} {{there was never}} {{anything}} like an explicit reconciliation. They simply ignored a quarrel; and Mrs. Lapham had only {{to say a few}} days after at breakfast, [...] "I guess the girls would like to go round with you <b>this</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and look <b>at</b> the new house," [...] in order to make her husband grumble out as he looked down into his coffee-cup. [...] "I guess we better all go, hadn't we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{going to}} work till lunch," [...] Paula {{explained}} to Graham. [...] "He swears I'm getting abominably rusty, and I think he's half right. We'll see you at lunch. You can stay if you care, of course; but I warn you it's {{really going to be}} work. And we're going swimming <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Four o'clock <b>at</b> the tank, Dick says. Also, he says he's got a new song he's going to sing then.--What time is it, Mr. Ware?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is because}} of my {{suspicious}} nature," [...] Peter said. [...] "There is a man staying in our hotel whom we are beginning to see quite a great deal of. He was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you <b>this</b> <b>afternoon.</b> He supped <b>at</b> the same restaurant last night. He is dining now three places behind you to the right, with a young lady who has been making flagrant attempts at flirtation with me, notwithstanding my gray hairs." ...|$|R
