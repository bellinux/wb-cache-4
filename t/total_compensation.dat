40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the extent to which culture, in six European and two North-American countries, affects CEO compensation. If differences in culture between countries can provide an explanation for cross-national differences in CEO compensation, it may increase multinational corporations understanding of how to design CEO compensations in the countries where they operate. Acquiring such knowledge would maximize the effect of their compensation plans. The study relates cultural dimensions to <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> and the ratio between variable <b>compensation</b> and <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation.</b> Cultural data, which comprises the study’s theoretical foundation, is based on the GLOBE study (House et al., 2004). Of the GLOBE study’s nine cultural dimensions, the study examines the five dimensions found most relevant to CEO compensation practices; performance orientation, uncertainty avoidance, institutional collectivism, future orientation and power distance. The research has been conducted through a regression analysis of 240, both private and publically listed companies. Companies with a turnover above € 49 million or at least 250 employees were randomly chosen in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, United States, Canada, France, Ireland and United Kingdom. The study’s results shows that the cultural dimensions examined, to different extent do affect CEO compensation. The results show <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> to be negatively related to institutional collectivism, power distance and performance orientation. Further, <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> is positively related to future orientation. The proportion of variable <b>compensation</b> to <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> is negatively related to institutional collectivism and uncertainty avoidance. The proportion of variable <b>compensation</b> to <b>total</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> is positively related with future orientation. Thus we conclude that culture can contribute to understand cross-national differences in CEO compensation...|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the <b>total</b> <b>compensation</b> from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.)
