5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{the heir}} of the Yagami clan, who wield pyrokinetic powers and sealed the Orochi demon {{along with the}} Kusanagi and Yata clans. However, after betraying the Kusanagi clan, the Yagami are cursed by Orochi giving them powers that cause all their members to die young. The {{character}} harbors hatred against the other clans, but later becomes obsessed with killing their heir Kyo. As a result, Iori sometimes helps him in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to have a final fight against him. Aside from the main series, Iori appears in several other media series such as spin-offs and crossover video games, and comic adaptations of the series.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the book's publication, Garland had {{approached}} the film's producers—Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich—about a possible film, {{and wrote a}} 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, {{the head of the}} company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play the part.

5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, {{the story}} of the Eritrean patriot was rewritten by Ethiopian comedian Yilma Manaye in his work Zeraye Derese. This {{character}} was interpreted by Wegayehu Nigatu (1944–1990), a popular actor at the Ethiopian National Theater in Addis Ababa at the time. When the play was staged in Eritrea at Asmara's Opera, Wegayehu Nigatu's interpretation of Zerai was successfully received by the audience and his performance was so convincing that Tesfazien Deres wanted to host the actor for two weeks in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to converse with him as with his dead brother.|$|E
25|$|A planet's {{movement}} {{around its}} rotational axis must also meet certain criteria if life is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to evolve. A first {{assumption is that}} the planet should have moderate seasons. If {{there is little or}} no axial tilt (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Go Seigen won {{a special}} Nihon Ki-in tournament <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to play a}} game against Honinbo Shusai Meijin. At that juncture, Honinbo Shusai {{embodied}} the highest go authority and tradition in Japan. In addition to inheriting the hereditary title of Honinbo, he was also the holder of the prestigious position of Meijin. The game between Go Seigen and Shusai was thus highly anticipated. The newspapers {{thought it would be a}} good business idea to publicize the game as a confrontation between Japan and China. As a consequence, Go Seigen became the unfortunate victim of rising Japanese nationalism. Before and during the game, he was often harassed and threatened by nationalists, and the windows of his house were smashed in.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> select “the best employees” {{that would}} not otherwise be available on the external labour market, firms may {{also be able to}} pay former apprentices a wage below the value of their marginal productivity, provided that labour markets are imperfect (Acemoglu and Pischke 1998, 1999 a,[b]; Stevens 1994 a). Thus, labour market frictions increase a firm’s willingness to make a net investment in apprenticeship training (while at the same time reducing an apprentice’s willingness to make such an investment), as the training firm will obtain part of the return from apprenticeship training. Labour market frictions potentially leading to imperfect labour markets include social partner agreements (collective bargaining), mobility costs of workers, moral hazard, monopsonies (see Muehlemann et al. 2013 b) or the interaction between firm-specific and general skills (see Lazear 2009).|$|R

In June 1705, under the false name of [...] "Monsieur de Busch", George visited the Ansbach court at their summer residence in Triesdorf to investigate incognito a marriage prospect: Caroline of Ansbach, the former ward of his aunt Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia. The English envoy to Hanover, Edmund Poley, reported that George was so taken by [...] "the good character he had of her that he would not think of anybody else".

He replaced Tom Jackson, who had gone 14–19 {{over the past three years}} and had decided to resign on November 17, 1993. He agreed to a four-year contract at a salary of $95,000 a year. Even though Skip came from a [...] "major football institution" [...] (Notre Dame), University of Connecticut President Dr. Harry J. Hartley said that the hire [...] "should not be seen as a signal that Connecticut intends to upgrade its program."

Two days later, Skip resigned as head coach of the Huskies in order to rejoin his father, who had taken the head coaching job at South Carolina the day before the Huskies' loss. As the leader of the Huskies football team, he accumulated a winning percentage of [...]596 (34–23) over five seasons.|$|E
