Cuba became the MPLA's strongest ally, sending significant contingents of combat and support personnel to Angola. <b>This</b> <b>support,</b> as well as that of several other countries of the Eastern Bloc, e.g. Romania and East Germany, was maintained during the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Gloucester {{had founded}} the Benedictine priory of StJames in 1137.

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Körös was based at Zemun, just {{upstream}} from Belgrade on the Danube. Her commander was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topčider Hill, although Körös was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. <b>This</b> <b>support</b> included the supply and emplacement of naval guns {{and the establishment of}} river obstacles and mines.|$|E

5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite <b>this</b> <b>support,</b> the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E
5|$|By June President Habyarimana {{had come}} to view Hutu Power, rather than the {{mainstream}} opposition, as {{the biggest threat to}} his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier, <b>this</b> <b>support</b> was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF, than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The RPF enjoyed much greater leverage following their successful February campaign, and the government eventually agreed to their power-sharing demands. The RPF were allocated up to 40% of the troops in the proposed unified national armed forces, and 50% of the officer corps. With all details agreed, the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.|$|E

Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} <b>this</b> <b>support,</b> the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E

A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman military attaché in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in the Ottoman cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest in Turkish neutrality in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With <b>this</b> <b>support,</b> UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
