25|$|When David {{heard that}} God had blessed Obed-Edom {{because of the}} Ark, David brought the Ark to Jerusalem with joy. When those who bore the Ark had gone six paces, they sacrificed an ox and a fatling. The Israelites brought up the Ark with {{shouting}} {{and the sound of}} the horn, and David danced with all his might girded with a linen ephod. As the Ark came into the city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> David leaping and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He said {{when he heard the}} two gunshots, he looked through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E
60|$|Anne's eyes flew to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> Matilda's face {{pressed against}} the pane.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} she glanced through <b>the</b> open <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Miss Panney {{at the front}} gate. Closing her desk, Mrs. Tolbridge pushed back her chair, her glow of {{satisfaction}} changing into a little chill.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{was passing}} through the little {{entryway}} that leads into the kitchen I happened to glance out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> four or five fellows down {{at the foot of}} the fire-escape." ...|$|R
2500|$|At a later time, a famine {{struck the}} land of Israel and Isaac moved his family, upon God's command, to Gerar, which was ruled by Abimelech, king of the Philistines. Like Abraham before him, who called Sarah his [...] "sister" [...] rather than his [...] "wife" [...] so that the Egyptians would not kill him and take his wife, Isaac told the people of Gerar that Rebecca was his sister. She was not molested, but one day Abimelech looked through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Isaac [...] "sporting" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for sexual play) with her. Abimelech called Isaac on his lie, and then warned others not to touch Rebecca. Eventually Isaac parted from Abimelech in peace.|$|E
2500|$|By 1971, Knievel {{realized}} that the U.S. government would never allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To keep his fans interested, Knievel considered several other stunts that might match the publicity {{that would have been}} generated by jumping the canyon. Ideas included jumping across the Mississippi River, jumping from one skyscraper to another in New York City, and jumping over 13 cars inside the Houston Astrodome. While flying back to Butte from a performance tour, Knievel looked out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the Snake River Canyon. After finding a location just east of Twin Falls, Idaho, that was wide enough, deep enough, and on private property, Knievel leased [...] for $35,000 to stage his jump. He set the date for Labor Day (September 4), 1972.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1998, Mayall {{was injured}} after {{crashing}} a quad bike {{near his home}} in Devon. Mayall's daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because there was already a spit of rain falling, indicating further rain, and he went on out alone. Mayall remembered nothing about the accident. His mind remained [...] "a total blank." [...] His wife Barbara looked out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him lying on the ground trapped beneath the quad, apparently turned over on top of him. Mayall tells the story that his wife believed it was just his silly joking and she initially left him for a few minutes. But Mayall was airlifted to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, with two haematomas and a fractured skull. During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in a coma for several days. After five days doctors felt it safe to bring Mayall back to consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Having read Mrs. Linley's answer, Mr. Sarrazin {{looked out}} of <b>the</b> breakfast-room <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> fog had reached the cottage. Before Mrs. Presty could make any remark on {{the change in the}} weather, he {{surprised}} her by an extraordinary question.|$|R
60|$|Left {{alone in}} the turret-room, Edgar Caswall {{carefully}} locked the door and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole. Next, he inspected <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{that they were not}} overlooked from any angle of the main building. Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over it with a magnifying glass. He found it intact: the steel bands were flawless; the whole trunk was compact. After sitting opposite to it for some time, and the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness, he gave up the task and went to his bedroom, after locking the door of the turret-room behind him and taking away the key.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever was her reason," [...] Sanders admitted, [...] "Jean wouldna {{open the}} door; but I keeked in at <b>the</b> parlor <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Mrs. Dishart in't looking very cosy-like and lauching; {{and do you}} think I would hae seen that if I had come ower the minister?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Other songs express emotions, such as [...] "Come On Write Me", which expresses vulnerability, {{something}} Van Peebles {{later said}} was absent from modern recordings by African American males. Van Peebles wrote [...] "Eyes On The Rabbit" [...] as a joke, {{inspired by the}} piano player's wife, who he described as [...] "sappy". Van Peebles said, [...] "I'm going to write the sappiest song I can." [...] Van Peebles rehearsed the song at the piano player's house, where the saxophonist and his wife, and the pianist and his wife stayed inside and watched Van Peebles playing the song outside. Van Peebles walked over to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{that none of them}} laughed at the song. He initially thought they didn't want to laugh at him, but realized that all of them were crying, and the song had a different emotional impact than he had intended. One of the watchers congratulated Van Peebles on the song, but Van Peebles explained that the song was a joke, angering him and his girlfriend, who wanted to beat Van Peebles up. Van Peebles backed off by claiming that the song wasn't a joke.|$|E
60|$|Those feet {{released}} {{him from his}} rigor. He turned towards <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> it starred and broken.|$|E
60|$|He went out, {{slamming}} the door behind him. Hal watched him from <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him turn down Broad Street.|$|E
60|$|Jonas's {{exposition}} {{of the plan}} of his school was here interrupted by the farmer's wife, who, as {{she sat at the}} end of the settle towards the fire, had her face somewhat turned towards <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> a light at a distance near the horizon.|$|R
60|$|As he {{came near}} the little market-place he bethought {{himself of the}} Christmas-tree candles. He {{did not intend to}} trouble himself. And yet, when he glanced in passing into <b>the</b> sweet-shop <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> it bare as a board, the very fact that he {{probably}} could not buy the things made him hesitate, and try.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} looked out through <b>the</b> narrow <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw,</b> rising {{high above the}} house-tops, like a finger {{pointing}} heavenward, the old gray tower and the gleaming cross. The city's din was far below, and through the summer air the faint coo of the doves and the flutter of their wings came down, like peaceful country sounds.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{all this}} time Prince Asmund and his sister sat in their trees just outside <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> all that was going on.|$|E
60|$|Miss Roxy ran to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{dancing and}} courtesying {{on the blue}} waves the little pinnace, with its fanciful pink pennon fluttered gayly by the indiscreet and {{flattering}} wind.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{looked through}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Geoffrey smoking his pipe--not {{in the back}} garden, as usual, but {{in front of the}} cottage, where he could keep his eye on the gate.|$|E
6000|$|They were in town. They passed Aunt Bessie's house. Aunt Bessie and Mrs. Bogart were at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> Carol <b>saw</b> {{that they}} were staring so intently that they {{answered}} her wave only with the stiffly raised hands of automatons. In the next block Mrs. Dr. Westlake was gaping from her porch. Carol said with an embarrassed quaver: ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a {{detonation}} {{shook the}} building. Maxwell, leaping from his couch, {{ran along the}} veranda and burst, breathless, into Niven's room. Bright moonlight streamed in through <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> sick man lying propped up on one elbow, with a pistol smoking in his hand. Niven appeared perfectly sane, and his voice was steady when he spoke.|$|R
60|$|When he {{was gone}} Tess stood at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>saw</b> his form crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises. He sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared. Then, without a sigh, she {{turned her attention to}} the room, and began clearing the table and setting it in order.|$|R
60|$|Happily, at {{the moment}} the shriek was uttered Andrew Black arrived, and, finding the troop-horses picketed outside, with no one {{apparently}} to guard them, he looked in at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> what was going on.|$|E
60|$|The skipper {{looked out}} of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the unhappy victim of Captain Zingall slowly approaching. His wife drew him away, and, despite his remonstrances, pushed him {{into the next room}} and closed the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's bringin' 'em along," [...] said Mrs. Kittridge, as {{she looked}} out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the tall, lank form of the Captain, with one child seated on either shoulder, and holding on by his head.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{knew how}} one {{pulled out the}} bars, but they baffled him and he knocked down the crossed supports. In {{front of the house}} he stopped, for a {{flickering}} light shone from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> Margaret sewing by the fire. His broken boots and torn clothes embarrassed him, but he braced {{up and went to the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|... "It does not. But I {{look at it}} in this light. As one of {{the detectives}} said, it is {{possible}} that somebody stood outside of <b>the</b> rear <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> you work <b>the</b> combination, but I doubt very much if they could learn the process in that way. There is a glare of light on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> that renders it very difficult to see at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Once at night, when Gertrude withdrew to her {{chamber and}} before seeking her pillow, {{prepared}} to retire as a preliminary to disrobing--in other words, {{before going to}} bed, she flung wide the casement (opened <b>the</b> <b>window)</b> <b>and</b> perceived (<b>saw)</b> <b>the</b> face of Lord Ronald. He {{was sitting on a}} thorn bush beneath her, and his upturned face wore an expression of agonised pallor.|$|R
6000|$|... "The othah naght Ah woke up {{and looked}} oat of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> all the roofs covered with snow, and it turned oat to be nothing but moonlaght. Ah was never so {{disappointed}} in mah lahfe," [...] said Miss Woodburn.|$|E
6000|$|... "But she can't--" [...] William exclaimed, as {{the door}} shut, [...] "not without any gloves and bread and butter in her hand!" [...] They ran to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> her walking rapidly along the street towards the City. Then she vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help that, Andy. It was Werner just {{as sure as}} I am {{standing}} here. I just happened to glance out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him crossing the roadway. He turned his face straight toward me, and I couldn't help but recognize him." ...|$|E
60|$|Ann Veronica {{for some}} indefinable reason {{did not want}} to lunch with him, a reason indeed so indefinable that she {{dismissed}} it, and Ramage went through the outer office with her, alert and attentive, to the vivid interest of the three clerks. The three clerks fought for <b>the</b> only <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> her whisked into a hansom. Their subsequent conversation is outside the scope of our story.|$|R
6000|$|It {{became evident}} that Redwood had still imperfectly apprehended {{the fact that}} an iron curtain had dropped between him and the outer world. They heard him go to the door, try the handle and rattle the lock, and then the voice of the officer who was {{stationed}} on the landing telling him it was no good to do that. Then afterwards they heard him at <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> men outside looking up. [...] "It's no good that way," [...] said the second officer. Then Redwood began upon the bell. The senior officer went up and explained very patiently that it could do no good to ring the bell like that, and if it was rung for nothing now it might have to be disregarded presently when he had need of something. [...] "Any reasonable attendance, Sir," [...] the officer said. [...] "But if you ring it just by way of protest we shall be obliged, Sir, to disconnect." ...|$|R
6000|$|With this {{remarkable}} explanation, old Mazey {{led the way}} to {{the lower end of the}} Hall, opened more doors, and showed Magdalen through another suite of rooms, four in number, all of moderate size, and all furnished in much the same manner as the rooms in the northern wing. She looked out of <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> neglected gardens of St. Crux, overgrown with brambles and weeds. Here and there, at no great distance in the grounds, the smoothly curving line of one of the tidal streams peculiar to the locality wound its way, gleaming in the sunlight, through gaps in the brambles and trees. The more distant view ranged over the flat eastward country beyond, speckled with its scattered little villages; crossed and recrossed by its network of [...] "back-waters"; and terminated abruptly by the long straight line of sea-wall which protects the defenseless coast of Essex from invasion by the sea.|$|R
