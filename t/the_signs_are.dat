5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. <b>The</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E

25|$|In September 2015, a 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian portion of <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> protested by ASIMDER who demanded its removal.

5000|$|An early {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> put on <b>the</b> {{hillside}} in 1923 and <b>the</b> current, permanent <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> created in 1929. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> cited as {{a prime example of}} [...] "civic boosterism"; the intention was to advertise the city's welcoming attitude toward industry. Its location was chosen so as to be visible from the main north-south highways El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway, {{as well as from the}} train and the nearby Mills Field airfield (now San Francisco International Airport). <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> originally proposed, and <b>the</b> first <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> placed, by <b>the</b> South San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.

25|$|Fougères {{participates in}} the contest of flowery cities and villages and has the label of four flowers (220 cities rewarded in France) and five in Ille-et-Vilaine {{for the quality of}} its {{planning}} and management of the landscaped areas. <b>The</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> located at all entrances of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} {{ovulation}} {{can be detected}} by signs. Because <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> not readily discernible by people other than the female, humans {{are said to have}} a concealed ovulation. In many animal species there are distinctive signals indicating the period when the female is fertile. Several explanations have been proposed to explain concealed ovulation in humans.|$|E

2500|$|The city {{permit for}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> received on September 19, 1940. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> built soon afterward by Ramsay Signs, who also owned it, and was first illuminated {{around the end}} of October 1940. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> read [...] "White Satin Sugar" [...] inside an outline of the state of Oregon, advertising a brand of sugar. In 1950, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> animated to show the state filling with sugar.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> approximations―each {{may be used}} to {{represent}} a variety of about 70 distinct combinations of sounds, within rules and conventions. The grid presents a system of monosyllabic signs of the type V/CV. Clarification of the 14 or so special values tested the limits of the grid model, but Chadwick in the end concluded that even with the ramifications, the syllabic signs can unexceptionally be considered monosyllabic.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{treatment}} for tick paralysis is the careful administration of anti-tick serum. The effectiveness of anti-tick serum is most dependent on how early it is administered. Early treatment {{offers the best}} chance of full recovery. Unlike snake bite, tick envenoming has a relatively slow onset. Despite this slow onset the fatality rate can be very high (even higher than snake bite) if antiserum is not given sufficiently early, before <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> advanced.|$|E
25|$|The Phaistos Disc {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} amateur and professional archaeologists, and many {{attempts have been made to}} decipher the code behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted decipherments assume that it is; most additionally assume a syllabary, others an alphabet or logography. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.|$|E

50|$|The Bekins Storage Co. Roof <b>Sign</b> <b>is</b> {{a rooftop}} <b>sign</b> in Pasadena, California, which {{originally}} advertised the Bekins Storage Company. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> erected in 1926 and {{converted to a}} neon sign in 1929.

Similar <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> now banned by Pasadena law, though signs from before 1960 are exempted and listed on a city register. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> later renovated to promote the A. American Storage Co. and now advertises Public Storage.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} stage which is called non-proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy (NPDR) there are no symptoms, <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> not visible to the eye and patients will have 20/20 vision. The only way to detect NPDR is by fundus photography, in which microaneurysms (microscopic blood-filled bulges in the artery walls) can be seen. If there is reduced vision, fluorescein angiography {{can be done to}} see the back of the eye. Narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen clearly and this is called retinal ischemia (lack of blood flow).|$|E
25|$|Baby Signing Time! is {{a sister}} series to Signing Time! It started in 2005 and is geared towards {{children}} aged 2 and younger; it {{is similar to}} the early volumes of Signing Time where <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> introduced one at a time. It is much more musical than regular Signing Time and teaches basic ASL signs for a baby's needs and environment. Coleman hosts this series as well, but instead of having a real Alex and Leah on the show, Alex, Leah, and Hopkins are featured as animated babies.|$|E
25|$|Road {{signs in}} Gibraltar and the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus are {{controlled}} by the Ministry of Defence. In the SBA road signs are modelled on Cypriot road signs rather than British Road signs {{including the use of}} metric speed limits while in Gibraltar <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> similar in appearance to the UK, but in line {{with the rest of the}} Iberian Peninsula, road signs use metric units and traffic drives on the right.

5000|$|The {{building}} is probably most {{known for the}} large neon red [...] "1st" [...] <b>sign</b> atop <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> has three sides and rises four stories to a height of fifty feet. In 1973 <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> turned off {{in response to the}} energy crisis. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> relighted ten years later after a major renovation. The original [...] "vermillion vitreous porcelain edged sign with a double row of red neon tubes" [...] was replaced with solely red tubes. Around four thousand feet of neon tubing was used in <b>the</b> renovation. <b>The</b> <b>sign</b> can <b>be</b> seen from almost 75 miles away from the air at night and 20 miles away on a clear day.After renovation in 2016 due to wind damage, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> relit, with a color changing LED <b>sign.</b> For <b>the</b> Winter Carnival in 2017, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> changed color from neon red to icy blue.

25|$|The first {{generation}} of the current signage system, introduced in 1977, {{can also be seen}} in on some national roads (and also on the oldest stretch of the M1). This is similar to the current system, but <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> simpler, a different shade of green is used, and the Irish place names are not in italics. These signs were directly based on the Worboys Committee designs which had been adopted in the UK in 1965. These signs were replaced by the current system on 1 January 1989. The design of signs has continued to evolve with the introduction of patching under the Guildford Rules in 1994 and the introduction of cantilever directional signs in 2005, as well as the expansion in gantry signage since then.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} and expression in Roman script of Mandarin and Hokkien into pīnyīn helps non-Mandarin and non-Hokkien speakers with the pronunciation {{of the name}} of a place whilst remaining in tandem with the use of English and Roman script in Singapore. The repackaging of the original names of Lau Pa Sat in Roman script, and inclusion of the appearance of an English translation as a secondary title {{can be seen as a}} way of heightening the sense of authenticity and heritage of the attraction as it is marketed as a culturally-rich area in Singapore, similar to Chinatown and Little India; both of which were formerly cultural enclaves of the distinctive races. Similarly in places that bear cultural significance, <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> printed in the language associated with the culture, such as The Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall which has an entirely Chinese sign without any translations.|$|E
