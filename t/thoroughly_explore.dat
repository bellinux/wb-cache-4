5|$|The {{outright}} {{cancellation of}} the Boeing contract on 11 December 1947 was staved off by a plea from its president William McPherson Allen to the Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington. Allen reasoned that the design was capable of being adapted to new aviation technology and more stringent requirements. In January 1948 Boeing was instructed to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>explore</b> recent technological innovations, including aerial refueling and the flying wing. Noting stability and control problems Northrop was experiencing with their YB-35 and YB-49 flying wing bombers, Boeing insisted on a conventional aircraft, and in April 1948 presented a US$30million (US$ today) proposal for design, construction, and testing of two Model 464-35 prototypes. Further revisions during 1948 resulted in an aircraft with {{a top speed of}} 513miles per hour (445kn, 825km/h) at 35,000feet (10,700m), a range of 6,909miles (6,005nmi, 11,125km), and a 280,000pounds (125,000kg) gross weight, which included 10,000pounds (4,500kg) of bombs and 19,875USgallons (75,225L) of fuel.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} of simulated annealing, by which an existing MSA produced by another method is refined {{by a series}} of rearrangements designed to find better regions of alignment space than the one the input alignment already occupies. Like the genetic algorithm method, simulated annealing maximizes an objective function like the sum-of-pairs function. Simulated annealing uses a metaphorical [...] "temperature factor" [...] that determines the rate at which rearrangements proceed and the likelihood of each rearrangement; typical usage alternates periods of high rearrangement rates with relatively low likelihood (to explore more distant regions of alignment space) with periods of lower rates and higher likelihoods to more <b>thoroughly</b> <b>explore</b> local minima near the newly [...] "colonized" [...] regions. This approach has been implemented in the program MSASA (Multiple Sequence Alignment by Simulated Annealing).|$|E

60|$|Now {{all these}} {{characters}} must be studied. It {{is true that}} the caution given in a preceding part of this chapter, against devoting undue and disproportionate attention to such persons must not be forgotten. Still, these individuals will require, and it is right that they should receive, a far greater degree of attention, so far as the moral administration of the school is concerned, than their mere numbers would appear to justify. This is the field in which the teacher is to study human nature; for here it shows itself without disguise. It is through this class, too, that a very powerful moral influence is to be exerted upon the rest of the school. The manner in which such individuals are managed; the tone the teacher assumes towards them; the gentleness with which he speaks of their faults, and the unbending decision with which he restrains them from wrong, will have a most powerful effect upon the rest of the school. That he may occupy this field, therefore, to the best advantage, it is necessary that he should first <b>thoroughly</b> <b>explore</b> it.|$|E

Focusing on one place has allows students {{to better understand the}} cultural fabric that carries the objects we study. In this way two things are accomplished: first, generating knowledge and work that is useful to this particular town and second, learning about patterns of cultural interconnection, an important tool in preserving cultural heritage that can be applied anywhere in the world.|$|E
