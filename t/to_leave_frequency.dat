40|$|Mathematical Theory of Evidence called also Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) {{is known}} as a {{foundation}} for reasoning when knowledge is expressed at various levels of detail. Though much research effort has been committed to this theory since its foundation, many questions remain open. One of the most important open questions seems to be the relationship between frequencies and the Mathematical Theory of Evidence. The theory is blamed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>frequencies</b> outside (or aside of) its framework. The seriousness of this accusation is obvious: (1) no experiment may be run to compare the performance of DST-based models of real world processes against real world data, (2) data may not serve as foundation for construction of an appropriate belief model. In this paper we develop a frequentist interpretation of the DST bringing to fall the above argument against DST. An immediate consequence of it is the possibility to develop algorithms acquiring automatically DST belief models from data. We propose three such algorithms for various classes of belief model structures: for tree structured belief networks, for poly-tree belief networks and for general type belief networks.

50|$|In 1997, TV2, a {{commercial}} channel {{was to be}} launched on the frequency where m2 used to be. However, MTV argued that by doing this, its audience would {{be given to the}} new channel as a present, which would mean severe disadvantage to both MTV and RTL Klub, the other debutee commercial channel. The authorities decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the <b>frequency</b> empty, and allocate a new frequency to TV2. m2, however, was still moved to satellite and cable reception only, which, at the time was quite rare. The programming available on MTV-2 was aimed at audiences which were most unlikely to receive the channel, so this meant a severe handicap for the company. Currently the company is recuperating from the decline earlier.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To explore {{regional}} {{differences in the}} effects of the sick <b>leave</b> <b>frequency</b> determinants between two homogeneous groups of workers from two comparable socio-economic regions in the Netherlands, namely Utrecht and South Limburg. Materials and Methods: Data on sick <b>leave</b> <b>frequency</b> for 137 cleaning workers in the regions of Utrecht (mean sick leave frequency: 0. 89 spells) and South Limburg (mean sick leave frequency: 1. 66 spells) were obtained from a Dutch social fund, and the data regarding their job, and health-related and individual characteristics were elicited by an interview. Results: A statistical analysis of the sick <b>leave</b> <b>frequency</b> in the two regions showed little differences, except for the determinant 'perceived physical workload' which was associated with the sick <b>leave</b> <b>frequency</b> in South Limburg but not in Utrecht. Conclusion: A regional difference in the sick <b>leave</b> <b>frequency</b> was noted with respect to 'perceived physical workload' as the study parameter. This would indicate that the findings of our earlier studies performed in the nineties of the last century. are still relevant.

40|$|Abstract Background Lebanon is {{perceived}} to be suffering from excessive nurse migration, low job satisfaction, poor retention and high turnover. Little is known about the magnitude of nurse migration and predictors of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the extent of nurses' intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and examine the impact of job satisfaction on intent <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> was explored <b>to</b> differentiate between nurses who intend <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their current hospital and those intending <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to survey nurses currently practicing in Lebanese hospitals. A total of 1, 793 nurses employed in 69 hospitals were surveyed. Questions included those relating to demographic characteristics, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and the McCloskey Mueller Satisfaction Scale. Univariate descriptive statistics were conducted on sample's demographic characteristics including gender, age, marital status and educational level. Bivariate associations between intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and demographic characteristics were tested using Pearson Chi-square. Differences in satisfaction scores between nurses with and without intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> were tested using t-test and ANOVA f-test. A multinomial logistic regression model was created to predict intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital and intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country. Results An alarming 67. 5 % reported intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> within the next 1 to 3 years, many of whom disclosed intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country (36. 7 %). Within nurses who reported an intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital but stay in Lebanon, 22. 1 % plan to move to a different health organization in Lebanon, 29. 4 % plan <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the profession and 48. 5 % had other plans. Nurses reported being least satisfied with extrinsic rewards. A common predictor of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital and the country was dissatisfaction with extrinsic rewards. Other predictors of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> (country or hospital) included age, gender, marital status, degree type, and dissatisfaction with scheduling, interaction opportunities, and control and responsibility. Conclusion Study findings demonstrate linkages between job satisfaction, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and migration in a country suffering from a nursing shortage. Findings can be used by health care managers and policy makers in managing job satisfaction, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and nurse migration. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNonlinear (large amplitude) {{vibrations}} of thin elastic plates can exhibit strongly nonlinear regimes {{characterized by}} a broadband Fourier spectrum and a cascade of energy from the large to the small wavelengths. This particular regime can be properly described {{within the framework of}} wave turbulence theory. The dynamics of the local kinetic energy spectrum is here investigated numerically with a finite difference, energy-conserving scheme, for a simply-supported rectangular plate excited pointwise and harmonically. Damping is not considered so that energy is left free to cascade until the highest simulated frequency is reached. The framework of non-stationary wave turbulence is thus appropriate to study quantitatively the numerical results. In particular, numerical simulations show the presence of a front propagating <b>to</b> high <b>frequencies,</b> <b>leaving</b> a steady spectrum in its wake, which has the property of being self-similar. When a finite amount of energy is given at initial state to the plate which is then left free to vibrate, the spectra are found to be in perfect accordance with the log-correction theoretically predicted. When forced vibrations are considered so that energy is continuously fed into the plate, a slightly steeper slope is observed in the low-frequency range of the spectrum. It is concluded that the pointwise forcing introduces an anisotropy that have an influence on the slope of the power spectrum, hence explaining one of the discrepancies reported in experimental studies...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of the local kinetic energy spectrum of an elastic plate vibrating in a wave turbulence (WT) regime is investigated with a finite difference, energy-conserving scheme. The numerical method allows the simulation of pointwise forcing together with realistic boundary conditions, a set-up which is close to experimental conditions. In the absence of damping, the framework of non-stationary wave turbulence is used. Numerical simulations show {{the presence of a}} front propagating <b>to</b> high <b>frequencies,</b> <b>leaving</b> a steady spectrum in its wake. Self-similar {{dynamics of}} the spectra are found with and without periodic external forcing. For the periodic forcing, the mean injected power is found to be constant, and the frequency at the cascade front evolves linearly with time resulting in a increase of the total energy. For the free turbulence, the energy contained in the cascade remains constant while the frequency front increases as t^{ 1 / 3 }. These self-similar solutions are found to be in accordance with the kinetic equation derived from the von Kármán plate equations. The effect of the pointwise forcing is observable and introduces a steeper slope at low frequencies, as compared to the unforced case. The presence of a realistic geometric imperfection of the plate is found to have no effect on the global properties of the spectra dynamics. The steeper slope brought by the external forcing is shown to be still observable in a more realistic case where damping is added...|$|R
