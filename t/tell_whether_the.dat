5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Court is applying that principle.

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of an n-ary predicate symbol {{is a set}} of n-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and n elements of the domain of discourse, one can <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation I(P) of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than the second.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the two books dealing with Gaia, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, Galaxia is {{conceived}} as a living organism which contains all the lifeforms and other non-living material in the galaxy. It is a utopia; the successor of Gaia. R. Daneel Olivaw founded Gaia with the purpose of Galaxia in mind, {{in order to be able}} to alter humanity for the better. However, since he could not tell whether this move would eventually hurt humanity, itself of almost unpredictable nature, and he therefore could not <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Zeroth Law permitted it, he could not by himself make the decision to implement Galaxia. Hari Seldon's Psychohistory Project was a 'backup' initiated by R. Daneel Olivaw in the event that Galaxia was not determined to be the ideal course of action.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have claimed}} that, without avian air sacs, modest {{improvements}} {{in a few}} aspects of a modern reptile's circulatory and respiratory systems would enable the reptile to achieve 50% to 70% of the oxygen flow of a mammal of similar size, and that lack of avian air sacs would not prevent the development of endothermy. Very few formal rebuttals {{have been published in}} scientific journals of Ruben et al.s claim that dinosaurs could not have had avian-style air sacs; but one points out that the Sinosauropteryx fossil on which they based much of their argument was severely flattened and therefore it was impossible to <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> liver was the right shape to act as part of a hepatic piston mechanism. Some recent papers simply note without further comment that Ruben et al. argued against the presence of air sacs in dinosaurs.|$|E

25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
25|$|Endowments are {{transferred}} with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast {{of a rare}} material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, {{is part of the}} duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, the facilitator invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The facilitator touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused.|$|E

500|$|The {{determinant}} [...] of {{a square}} matrix [...] is a scalar that <b>tells</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> associated map is an isomorphism or not: {{to be so}} it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.

25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot <b>tell</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E

[...] Although he was not completely convinced he wrote, [...] " [...] the vocals are more processed than a cheese string [...] the combination of a playful nursery rhyme hook and Dr Luke's bubblegummy electro production make this a pretty irresistible little dancefloor ditty." [...] He went on to give the single three out of five stars. Fraser McAlpine of BBC met the song with a mixed review giving the song three out of five stars. Fraser criticized the choice of the song commenting, [...] "there's a fear that if Kesha reveals that she's a sensitive young flower after all, with real feelings and a good, pure heart, her appeal with disappear like a soap bubble on a cactus, can it?". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was negative in his review of the song, calling it [...] "outright stupid" [...] and noted it would be something commonly heard on a playground. Adams wrote that the song touched on opposite-sex objectification, but wrote that the theme became wearisome on the album, using the song as one of the examples where the theme was overused.|$|E
