The population was observed and interviewed through a session, with positive results noted throughout. The conclusions suggested that it has positive effect on group dynamic and morale, as well as therapeutic benefits. An interesting perspective made by the researchers was the cost effective nature of group therapy.

25|$|Research {{continues}} on saturation decompression modelling and schedule testing. In 2015 a concept named Extended Oxygen Window {{was used in}} preliminary tests for a modified saturation decompression model. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>allows</b> a faster rate of decompression {{at the start of}} the ascent to utilise the inherent unsaturation due to metabolic use of oxygen, followed by a constant rate limited by oxygen partial pressure of the breathing gas. The period of constant decompression rate is also limited by the allowable maximum oxygen fraction, and when this limit is reached, decompression rate slows down again as the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced. The procedure remains experimental as of May 2016. The goal is an acceptably safe reduction of overall decompression time for a given saturation depth and gas mixture.|$|E

2500|$|The {{binary state}} {{speciation}} and extinction model (BiSSE) is a discrete-space model {{that does not}} directly follow the framework of those mentioned above. [...] It allows estimation of ancestral binary character states jointly with diversification rates associated with different character states; {{it may also be}} straightforwardly extended to a more general multiple-discrete-state model. [...] In its most basic form, this model involves six parameters: two speciation rates (one each for lineages in states 0 and 1); similarly, two extinction rates; and two rates of character change. [...] <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>allows</b> for hypothesis testing on the rates of speciation/extinction/character change, at the cost of increasing the number of parameters.|$|E

[...] Olson then argues [...] " [...] {{that these two}} types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness." [...] She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with trustworthiness and ends with unreliability. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>allows</b> for all shades of grey in between the poles of trustworthiness and unreliability. It is consequently up to each individual reader to determine the credibility of a narrator in a fictional text.|$|E
2500|$|The {{important}} {{concept of}} the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby {{from the work of}} the philosopher Kenneth Craik, who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a [...] "small-scale model" [...] consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>allows</b> a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>allows</b> for the {{existence}} of three or more partitions of node classes. However, including more classes makes modifications to the discrete model more difficult.

Nevertheless, the threshold of what constitutes a high ‘coreness’ value must be justified theoretically.|$|E
