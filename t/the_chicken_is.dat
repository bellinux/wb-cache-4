5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. <b>The</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} {{widespread}} domesticated species and {{one of the}} human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400 BCE in the Levant. Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species. The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.|$|E
40|$|Ascaridia galli {{populations in}} {{intestine}} of chickens treated with combination of excretory/secretory L 3 and immunoglobulin yolk ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine the presence of worm populations in intestine of chickens vaccinated and combined with egg yolk to experimental Ascaridia galli infection. Amount of 18 head <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> devided into six groups (A – F). Group A, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> not vaccinated. Group B, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3. Group C, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3, challenged with dose 1000 L 2, and treated ten times with 0, 875 mg egg yolk with an interval of one day intra orally. Group D, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3 and challenged with dose 1000 L 2. Group E, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> challenged with dose 1000 L 2 and treated ten times with 0, 875 mg egg yolk with an interval of one day intra orally. Group E, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> challenged with dose 1000 L 2. Intestinal worm burdens of infected groups were recorded. The result showed that excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3 combined with egg yolk decreased significantly A. galli survival in intestine of laying hens. Vaccinations were positively correlated with worm burden at 12 weeks after chalanged. The results suggest that A. galli L 3 excretory/secretory product contain potential antigen and that antibody-mediated mechanisms contribute to immune protection...|$|R

25|$|Despite its humble ubiquity {{among the}} poor, {{it is also}} popular as a main entrée when cooked {{with a variety of}} meats. For example, cháo gà is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger. The rice {{porridge}} is cooked in the broth in which a whole chicken had been boiled, and once <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> cooked, the meat is sliced and layered on a bed of shredded raw cabbage and sliced scallions and drizzled with a vinegar-based sauce, to be eaten as a side dish to the porridge. Other combinations include cháo vịt (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same fashion as the chicken porridge, but with duck. Cháo lòng heo is made with lòng heo, a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. Cháo is typically served with quẩy on the side.|$|E
500|$|Generally, {{chickens}} are not fried whole; instead, <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} its constituent pieces. The two white meat sections are the breast and the wing {{from the front}} of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thigh and leg or [...] "drumstick", are from the rear of the chicken. These pieces are usually subdivided into the wings, the breasts (the wishbone is often cut out first in home cooking), the legs, and the thighs. The ribs are sometimes left on the breast, but commercially they and the back are usually discarded.|$|E
500|$|KFC's {{core product}} {{offering}} is pressure fried, on-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with Colonel Harland Sanders' [...] "Original Recipe" [...] of 11 herbs and spices. The product is typically available in either {{two or three}} piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 chicken pieces. Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone-based breast cut divided into 2 pieces). The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two- to four-minute process. It is then pressure fried for between seven and ten minutes (the timing differs between countries) in oil at 185 degrees Celsius. Following this, <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> left to stand for 5 minutes in order for it to sufficiently cool before it {{is placed in the}} warming oven. It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. The frying oil varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil. A KFC executive stated that the taste of the chicken will vary between regions depending on the oil variety used, and whether the chicken has been corn-fed or wheat-fed.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

60|$|Not {{that this}} righteousness, by being {{bestowed}} upon us, is severed from Jesus Christ; {{for it is}} still his and in him. How then, may some say, doth it become ours? I answer, by our being put into him. For of God are we in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us, of him, 'righteousness.' And again, we are made 'the righteousness of God in him.' So then, the righteousness of Christ covereth his, as a man's garments cover {{the members of his}} body, for we are 'the body of Christ, and members in particular' (1 Cor 12:27). The righteousness therefore is Christ's; resideth still in him, and covereth us, as the child is lapped up in its father's skirt, or as <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> covered with the feathers of the hen. I make use of all these similitudes thereby to inform you of my meaning; for by all these things are set forth the way of our being made righteous to justification of life (Matt 23:37; Eze 16:8; Psa 36:7).|$|E

60|$|Miss Tox {{emerges from}} behind the cherubim's leg, when all is quiet, and comes slowly down from the gallery. Miss Tox's eyes are red, and her pocket-handkerchief is damp. She is wounded, but not exasperated, and she hopes they may be happy. She quite admits to herself {{the beauty of the}} bride, and her own {{comparatively}} feeble and faded attractions; but the stately image of Mr Dombey in his lilac waistcoat, and his fawn-coloured pantaloons, is present to her mind, and Miss Tox weeps afresh, behind her veil, on her way home to Princess's Place. Captain Cuttle, having joined in all the amens and responses, with a devout growl, feels much improved by his religious exercises; and in a peaceful frame of mind pervades the body of the church, glazed hat in hand, and reads the tablet to the memory of little Paul. The gallant Mr Toots, attended by the faithful Chicken, leaves the building in torments of love. <b>The</b> <b>Chicken</b> <b>is</b> as yet unable to elaborate a scheme for winning Florence, but his first idea has gained possession of him, and he thinks the doubling up of Mr Dombey would be a move in the right direction. Mr Dombey's servants come out of their hiding-places, and prepare to rush to Brook Street, when they are delayed by symptoms of indisposition on the part of Mrs Perch, who entreats a glass of water, and becomes alarming; Mrs Perch gets better soon, however, and is borne away; and Mrs Miff, and Mr Sownds the Beadle, sit upon the steps to count what they have gained by the affair, and talk it over, while the sexton tolls a funeral.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate whether the presence of light or different colors of light would influence the energy expenditure and behavior of broiler chickens. Eight 8 -week-old broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> adapted to a respiration chamber (Length, 28. 5 cm; Height, 38. 5 cm; Width, 44. 0 cm) for one week prior to the initiation of the experiment. In experiment 1, energy expenditure and behavior of <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> analyzed in <b>the</b> presence or absence of light for four days. <b>Chickens</b> <b>were</b> exposed to 6 cycles of 2 h light/ 2 h dark period per day. In experiment 2, <b>the</b> broiler <b>chickens</b> that had <b>been</b> used in experiment 1 were used to evaluate the effect of 4 different wavelength light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the energy expenditure and behavior of broiler <b>chickens.</b> <b>The</b> LEDs used in this study had the following wavelength bands; white (control), red (618 to 635 nm), green (515 to 530 nm) and blue (450 to 470 nm). <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> randomly exposed to a 2 -h LED light in a random and sequential order per day for 3 days. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production of <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> recorded using an open-circuit calorimeter system, and energy expenditure was calculated based on the collected data. The behavior of <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>was</b> analyzed based on following categories i. e., resting, standing, and pecking, and closed-circuit television was used to record these behavioral postures. The analysis of data from experiment 1 showed that the energy expenditure was higher (p< 0. 001) in chickens under light condition compared with those under dark condition. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> spent more time with pecking during a light period, but they frequently exhibited resting during a dark period.
