5|$|Before {{deciding}} on Capital Waterside {{as the site}} of the National Assembly, Davies announced on 13 March 1998, that an international competition would be held to select the design of the building for the debating chamber. Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Competitions would oversee the competition and a design panel would recommend a design to the Secretary of State for Wales. The Design Competition Advisory Panel was made up of seven members and was chaired by Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, the former MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The chair and four members were appointed by Davies and the remaining two members were appointed by the RIBA. The competition was advertised in the Official Journal of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> on 13 June 1998.|$|E
40|$|The {{relations}} between the United States and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> under <b>the</b> Nixon Administration (1969 - 1974) were considerably changing. Post- 1945 cooperation and dependence increasingly gave way to economic competition and division in military and foreign policies. Yet, the United States and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> {{knew that they were}} strategically important to each other, thus they had to continue cooperation and coordination to defend and advance their economic and strategic interests. With a documentary research approach, this paper aims to examine how the United States and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> their partnership evolved between 1969 and 1974. It explores the ties that the Nixon Administration designed to bind <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community’s</b> responses. It also puts forth that despite their efforts to continue cooperation; the {{relations between}} the United States and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> were on a downward course. It will be concluded that the United States and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> experienced a difficult time in their relations between 1969 and 1974, but both sides showed certain efforts to maintain the partnership...|$|R

5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>communities</b> of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain. The region was also called the Queanbeyan/Yass district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established town with a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.|$|E
5|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E

50|$|Monnet {{resigned}} on Europe day 1955 {{following the}} failure of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Defence <b>Community</b> and was succeeded by the Mayer Authority.

5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} a single Council of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> by 1987.|$|E
25|$|Membership in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities,</b> {{achieved}} in 1986, contributed to stable {{economic growth and}} development, largely through increased trade ties and an inflow of funds allocated by the European Union (and before that <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities)</b> to improve the country's infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|The Treaty of Rome, the {{original}} full name {{of which was}} the Treaty establishing <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Economic <b>Community</b> has been amended by successive treaties significantly changing its content. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht established <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union, <b>the</b> EEC becoming one of its three pillars, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community.</b> Hence, <b>the</b> treaty was renamed the Treaty establishing <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> (TEC).|$|R

25|$|Prior to {{the entry}} into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union {{comprised}} a system of three legal pillars, of which only <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> pillar had its own legal personality. The Treaty of Lisbon abolished this pillar system, and as a consolidated entity, the European Union succeeded the legal personality of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> Therefore, the EU is now able to sign international treaties in its own name. The European Union gained for example membership of the World Trade Organization immediately after the {{entry into force}} of the Treaty of Lisbon, since <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> was already {{a member of that}} organisation.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} five years, {{regional}} policy in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> has been characterized by radical changes in the policies of individual Member States {{as well as the}} regional policy of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> (EC) itself. Particularly in northern Europe, traditional regional policy has come under considerable strain with the rise of competing policy priorities and public expenditure constraints. The increasing independence of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> in <b>the</b> exercise of its own regional policy, as well as interventions in regional aid by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Commission under EC competition policy, have contributed to the pressures on Member States.
