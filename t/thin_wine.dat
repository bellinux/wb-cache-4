60|$|There {{had been}} earlier {{drinking}} than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six {{o'clock in the}} morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> {{at the best of}} times, but it would seem to have been an unusually <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{took him}} {{on board the}} Estremedura, {{and when he had}} removed most of the {{coal-dust}} from his person they sat down with a bottle of <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> before them in the sobrecargo's room. Jefferson was lean in face and person, though he was largely made, and had dark eyes that could smile and yet retain a certain intentness and gravity. His voice had a little ring in it, and, big as he was, he was seldom altogether still. When he filled his glass his long fingers tightened on it curiously.|$|E
60|$|Defarge had {{described}} himself, that day, as {{the keeper of}} a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For {{the first time in}} many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light <b>thin</b> <b>wine,</b> and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it.|$|E
25|$|Blaufränkisch is {{considered}} a high productive vine capable of producing high yields fairly easily. In some parts of Europe {{it is not uncommon}} to see it harvested at 100 hectoliters/hectare (approx 5.3 ton/acre). However over-cropping the vine has a tendency to produce <b>thin</b> <b>wines</b> with lots of green, weedy notes.|$|R

6000|$|Then Clement {{tried the}} priest of the curious little {{church on the}} hill-side, a memory of Elijah and the convents on Mount Carmel. The Parrocco was a courteous man, quite a peasant, and {{too young to know}} much about the past generation. He gave Clement a refection of white bread, goats' milk cheese, and coffee, and held up his hands on the declining of his <b>thin</b> <b>wine.</b> There was a kind of {{register}} of baptisms, and Giovanni Batista Benista was hunted out, and it was found that if alive he would be over seventy years old. But no more was known, and there was no proof that he was dead twenty-two years before! ...|$|E
60|$|Underneath the balcony, when we return, the {{inferior}} servants {{of the inn}} are supping in the open air, at a great table; the dish, a stew of meat and vegetables, smoking hot, and served in the iron cauldron it was boiled in. They have a pitcher of <b>thin</b> <b>wine,</b> and are very merry; merrier than the gentleman with the red beard, who is playing billiards in the light room on {{the left of the}} yard, where shadows, with cues in their hands, and cigars in their mouths, cross and recross the window, constantly. Still the thin Cure walks up and down alone, with his book and umbrella. And there he walks, and there the billiard-balls rattle, long after we are fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|Soft and summery, fertile and reposeful, was the scene; and {{the busy}} peasants at their work {{added to the}} charm. Pretty English {{children}} with Breton nurses, each in the costume of her native town, played under the lindens all abloom with odorous flowers and alive with bees. Workmen came to these green places to eat the black bread and drink the <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> that was all their dinner. Invalids strolled here after their baths at the little house in the rose-garden below. Pretty girls walked there in the twilight with long-haired lovers in knee breeches and round hats. Nuns in their grey gowns went to and fro from hospital and the insane asylum or charity school; and the beautiful old priest sometimes went feebly by, smiling paternally on his flock, who rose and uncovered reverently as he passed.|$|E
500|$|From the 4th century {{through the}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the Languedoc had a {{reputation}} for producing high quality wine. In Paris during the 14th century, wines from the St. Chinian area were prescribed in hospitals for their [...] "healing powers". During the advent of the Industrial Age in the late 19th century, production shifted towards mass-produced le gros rouge — cheap red wine that could satisfy the growing work force. The use of highly prolific grape varieties produced high yields and <b>thin</b> <b>wines,</b> which were normally blended with red wine from Algeria to give them more body.|$|R

60|$|One {{afternoon}} he was {{returning from a}} foraging trip to the lower world, with bread and curds {{and a bottle of}} <b>thin</b> <b>wine.</b> Halfway up his dark stairway he met--or rather came upon, for she rested on the stair--a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet's imagination. A loose, dark cloak, flung open, showed a rich gown beneath. Her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought. Within one moment they would be round and artless like a child's, and long and cozening like a gypsy's. One hand raised her gown, undraping a little shoe, high-heeled, with its ribbons dangling, untied. So heavenly she was, so unfitted to stoop, so qualified to charm and command! Perhaps she had seen David coming, and had waited for his help there.|$|E
60|$|And when I reached Mairena it was {{the most}} cheerless place I had come across on my journey, merely a poverty-stricken hamlet that did not even boast a bad inn. I was {{directed}} from place to place before I could find a stable; I was soaked to the skin, and there seemed no shelter. At last I discovered a wretched wine-shop; but the woman who kept it said there was no fire and no food. Then I grew very cross. I explained with heat that I had money; it is true I was bedraggled and disreputable, but when I showed some coins, to prove that I could pay for what I bought, she asked unwillingly what I required. I ordered a brasero, and dried my clothes as best I could by the burning cinders. I ate a scanty meal of eggs, and comforted myself with the <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> of the leaf, sufficiently alcoholic to be exhilarating, and finally, with aguardiente regained my equilibrium.|$|E
60|$|If Diogenes {{coming to}} life again could have rolled himself, tub and all, into Mr Pecksniff's parlour {{and could have}} seen Tom Pinch as he sat on Mercy Pecksniff's stool with his plate and glass before him {{he could not have}} faced it out, though in his surliest mood, but must have smiled good-temperedly. The perfect and entire {{satisfaction}} of Tom; his surpassing appreciation of the husky sandwiches, which crumbled in his mouth like saw-dust; the unspeakable relish with which he swallowed the <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> by drops, and smacked his lips, as though it were so rich and generous that to lose an atom of its fruity flavour were a sin; the look with which he paused sometimes, with his glass in his hand, proposing silent toasts to himself; and the anxious shade that came upon his contented face when, after wandering round the room, exulting in its uninvaded snugness, his glance encountered the dull brow of his companion; no cynic in the world, though in his hatred of its men a very griffin, could have withstood these things in Thomas Pinch.|$|E
6000|$|... “Ave Maria!” he said softly, {{and taking}} a small loaf from the basket broke it into two pieces. One he held out {{with a bottle of}} <b>thin</b> red <b>wine,</b> while he glanced at {{the other half of the}} loaf deprecatingly.|$|R
60|$|Appleby made no answer, {{but it was}} by {{an effort}} that, feeling his comrade’s eyes upon him, he sat still, {{when the door opened}} and a cazadore came in. He laid down a piece of bread and a bottle of <b>thin</b> red <b>wine,</b> and then glanced at them compassionately.|$|R
60|$|The innkeeper set food before them—beans and oil, an omelet, and {{a bottle}} of <b>thin</b> red <b>wine</b> from the Canaries.

60|$|Such was {{the fate}} of the poor gentle folk who for unknown ages had swung their hammocks to the stems of these Moriches, {{spinning}} the skin of the young leaves into twine, and making sago from the pith, and <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> from the sap and fruit, while they warned their children not to touch the nests of the humming-birds, which even till lately swarmed around the lake. For--so the Indian story ran-- once on a time a tribe of Chaymas built their palm-leaf ajoupas upon the very spot where the lake now lies, and lived a merry life. The sea swarmed with shellfish and turtle, and the land with pine- apples; the springs were haunted by countless flocks of flamingoes and horned screamers, pajuis and blue ramiers; and, above all, by humming-birds. But the foolish Chaymas were blind to the mystery and the beauty of the humming-birds, and would not understand how they were no other than the souls of dead Indians, translated into living jewels; and so they killed them in wantonness, and angered 'The Good Spirit.' But one morning, when the Guaraons came by, the Chayma village had sunk deep into the earth, and in its place had risen this lake of pitch. So runs the tale, told some forty years since to M. Joseph, author of a clever little history of Trinidad, by an old half-caste Indian, Senor Trinidada by name, who was said then to be nigh one hundred years of age.|$|E
60|$|The {{proprietor}} of the vineyard stood by; a man with the most purple face and hugest and reddest nose that I ever beheld in my life. It must have taken innumerable hogsheads of his thin vintage to empurple his face in this manner. He chuckled much over the statue, and, I suppose, counts upon making his fortune by it. He is now awaiting a bid from the Papal government, which, I believe, has the right of pre-emption whenever any relics of ancient art are discovered. If the statue could but be smuggled out of Italy, it might command almost any price. There is not, I think, any name of a sculptor on the pedestal, as on that of the Venus de' Medici. A dolphin is sculptured on the pillar against which she leans. The statue is of Greek marble. It was first found about eight days ago, but has been offered for inspection only a day or two, and already the visitors come in throngs, and the beggars gather about {{the entrance of the}} vineyard. A wine shop, too, seems to have been opened on the premises for the accommodation of this great concourse, and we saw a row of German artists sitting at a long table in the open air, each with a glass of <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> and something to eat before him; for the Germans refresh nature ten times to other persons once.|$|E
60|$|Its abiding {{place was}} {{in all things}} fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a {{brooding}} look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air {{of the people there}} was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of <b>thin</b> <b>wine</b> and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran {{down the middle of the}} street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of <b>thin</b> red <b>wines</b> produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|R

50|$|Wine is {{a primary}} {{ingredient}} in wine sauce. Wine sauce may be prepared using various wines, such as red wines, white wines, Burgundy wines, and port wines, among others. Ingredients in addition to wine may include stock, mushrooms, butter or shrimp butter, tarragon vinegar, shallot, chervil, tarragon, spices, onion, garlic and others. Some wine sauces are prepared using a reduction, which may intensify their flavor or make the flavor sharper. Reduced wine {{may be used to}} prepare thicker wine sauces, while those lacking a reduction are generally <b>thin.</b> Some <b>wine</b> sauces are creamy, prepared with the addition of cream or milk.|$|R
5000|$|In making tocino in the Philippines, {{the pork}} belly meat is first sliced into <b>thin</b> strips.

5000|$|The wine {{produced}} was undistinguished, but it {{was produced}} cheaply and in huge quantities. The simple reds of Languedoc initially competed with equally simple reds made closer to Paris, in areas {{where most of the}} wine production disappeared in the early 20th century due to the combined effect of competition and phylloxera. Thus, the wines were not made in a mold that wine consumers of the late 20th and early 21st century would have recognised as a typical [...] "warm climate" [...] style, but rather outmatched other <b>thin</b> red <b>wines</b> by means of sheer volume and lower production costs.

60|$|We devoured our meal of cold {{meats and}} pickled fish, fruit and junket {{and a kind}} of harsh cheese, as if in contest for a wager. And copious was the <b>thin</b> spicy <b>wine</b> with which we swam it home.

Then a great vacancy would overspread his face turned to the window, as {{suddenly}} to gather to a cheerful smile, and light, irradiated, once more on me.

60|$|Mr. Vizetelly is {{of opinion}} that the pure juice was apt to grow harsh, or become ropy, with age. They {{remedied}} the former defect by adding a little gloria, a <b>thin,</b> sweet <b>wine</b> kept in store from the preceding vendange; this was done in April or in May, when the vintage was received at headquarters. Ropiness was cured by repeated rackings and by brandying, eight gallons per pipe being the normal ratio. That distinguished connoisseur found in an old malmsey of 1859 all the aroma and lusciousness of a good liqueur; the 'London particular' of 1865 tasted remarkably soft, with a superior nose; an 1871-72, made for the Russian market, had an oily richness with a considerable aroma; an 1872 was mellow and aromatic, and an 1875 had a good vinous flavour.|$|R
60|$|There were nuts also--green, coral, and cinnamon, {{long and}} little, hairy, smooth, crinkled, rough, in pairs, dark and double, round-ribbed and nuggeted--every kind of nut the pouch of Mulgar knows.

And while they ate and drank and made merry, lifting their cups, {{cracking}} their nuts, hungrily supping, a distant and beautiful music clashed {{in the air}} around the feasting travellers, like the music of cymbal and dulcimer. Nod sat silken-silvery, with every hair enlustred, his wrinkles gone, his small right hand feeding him, while with his woman-hand he clasped his Wonderstone, his little face bright as a child's, with topaz eyes.
