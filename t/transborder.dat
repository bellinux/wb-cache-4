40|$|This paper {{tries to}} resolve the puzzle firstly: how can Korean pop (K-Pop) become <b>transbordering</b> since Korean is not the main {{language}} in the world? It {{can be attributed to}} the policy input and capital integration, the textual circulation through emerging audio-video platform on-line, as well as the specific textual form with intensive visuality and embodiment. This paper applies not only traditionally visual-textual analysis but also the new methodology called “following the object” by the British sociologists Scott Lash and Celia Lury. The researcher regards K-Pop as an object of cross-cultural consumption and tracks its circulation from local production to “glocal” consumption. Through the interview to the K-Pop professionals, review of the relevant articles, textual analysis of the music videos and the ethnographic fieldwork of local fans community, this paper tries to answer the two questions: (1) how does K-Pop produce itself by the strategies of visualization and embodiment, as well as gendered performance; (2) how do the fans appropriate the K-Pop texts to re-perform and re-shape their gender identities in their everyday life...|$|R
40|$|This book, <b>Transbordering</b> Latin Americas: Liminal Places, Cultures, and Powers (T) Here, explores transbordering/transnational Latin American sociocultural {{and spatial}} {{conditions}} {{across the globe}} and across scales—from the gendered and racialized body to the national and transnational arena. What do we mean by “transbordering Latin Americas”? When we use the plural Latin Americas, we purposefully implode {{the notion of a}} unified, cohesive, and static Latin America and a corresponding singular identity—a way of being or being perceived as Latin American. The phrase “transbordering Latin Americas” thus comprises instances of that which can be defined as “Latin American” (which is, in turn, open to debate and transformation), which occurs through plurilocal societal relations—existing within, between, and above the traditional container spaces of national and continental societies without clear or stable “motherlands” (Pries 2004; Irazábal, 2012). Latin Americas in plural aims to push further the problematization of “methodological nationalism,” or the tendency to liken society to the nation-state. Indeed, despite its continuous undeniable importance in framing social dynamics, the nation-state has been debunked as the “natural” unit of the modern world and particularly as a useful one for the study of migration and diasporic phenomena (Duany 2011; Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). This book suggests the need to go beyond not only “methodological nationalism” but also “methodological continentalism” to effectively deconstruct and reconstruct the notion of multiple and fluxing Latin Americas...|$|R
40|$|My PhD {{research}} {{focuses on}} Greek- and Turkish-speaking Cypriots, their musical performances and Mediterranean <b>transbordering</b> tropes, and their diaspora to Birmingham (UK). It introduces a new spatial construction in diaspora which I term "The Mediterranean Imaginary"—an informed, playful, and re-structured space in the triangle of Cyprus, Turkey and Greece, defined by {{the history of the}} Cypriot di-ethnos, assessed in modern life through ethnographically-informed lived realities, yet geographically determined in the not-so- Mediterranean UK. After describing the ethnos in question (Preface) and orienting the reader to the methodological and theoretical approaches employed (Chapter 1), focus turns to the notion of nostalgic musical ends in Chapter 2, which via performance avenues foregrounds emotionality and a gender-play with feminine undertones alongside the diasporic masculine imperative. Part II, ‘Extending Our Senses’, analyses four YouTube videos. Chapter 3, ‘Zorba’, takes us to the Bullring Shopping Centre and a dance flash-mob; and in Chapter 4, a father-son duo (Stavros Flatley) reprises the famous neo-Celtic performances of Michael Flatley for Britain’s Got Talent. Chapter 5 examines Lil Maaz’s music-video Eat Kebabs and its effect on Turkishspeaking Cypriot migrants, while Chapter 6 looks into a parody of 50 Cent’s Candy Shop named Kebab Shop, dubbed with lyrics from the Cypriot YouTube user hasandinho 95. Part III compares native and diasporic practices against the background of Cyprus’ Mediterranean appeal. Following the construction of the Mediterranean imaginary, Mediterranean ethnomusicologies are advanced with the analysis of a set of versions of the Cypriot traditional tune Tillirka. Tillirka’s timeline traces a distant ecumenical past and a translocal native modern with fragmented censorial claims, peaking in diaspora where it recapitulates to the ecumenical and Mediterranean, turning into a contemporary paradigm of pan-Mediterranean culture and performance in diaspora...|$|R

40|$|Este trabalho discute experiÃncias transfronteiriÃas de brasileiros retornados de migraÃÃes no Paraguai, conhecidos como, na cidade de Marechal CÃndido Rondon, na regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ. Tais sujeitos, em busca de terra farta e barata, se lanÃaram em massa pelo Paraguai entre as dÃcadas de 1970 e 1980. Embora nÃo se tenha um nÃmero preciso, estima-se que em meados da dÃcada de 1980 havia cerca de quinhentos mil brasileiros ocupando as regiÃes fronteiriÃas do Paraguai com o Brasil. No entanto, com mais intensidade a partir da dÃcada de 1990, iniciou-se o retorno desses sujeitos em razÃo de um conjunto de situaÃÃes econÃmicas e polÃticas que os afetaram diretamente naquele paÃs. Muitos dos quais se incorporaram ao Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem TerraâMST. Nas Ãltimas dÃcadas, de forma expressiva, esses migrantes tÃm regressado aos municÃpios brasileiros fronteiriÃos com as regiÃes em que viviam no Paraguai. O modo como experimentam e se relacionam no meio urbano, assim como, o modo como lidam e atravessam tais fronteiras geogrÃficas, sociais e culturais sÃo questÃes abordadas neste trabalho. As narrativas sobre esses percursos revelaram trajetÃrias que vem se fazendo no âestando aquiâ e no âestando lÃâ, negociando e convivendo com valores, identificaÃÃes e pertencimentos sociais. Tais homens e mulheres buscam no urbano novos espaÃos de trabalho, assistÃncia mÃdica, previdenciÃria e escolarizaÃÃo. O retorno muitas vezes Ã motivado pelas mulheres, cujas expectativas ultrapassam as necessidades materiais. Desse modo vÃem na cidade um campo de possibilidades de reverem suas posiÃÃes frente Ãs prÃticas, costumes e cÃdigos estabelecidos entre as relaÃÃes de gÃnero vividas em situaÃÃes de fronteira. Suas memÃrias tambÃm expressam a existÃncia de redes de sociabilidades construÃdas no tempo diante das muitas carÃncias enfrentadas. Entre as quais, a necessidade de trabalho, que atualmente tem sido, no caso dos homens, como pedreiros e ajudantes de construÃÃo, e, das mulheres, como empregadas domÃsticasThis work {{is focused}} on <b>transbordering</b> {{experiences}} from Brazilian people that returned from migrations in Paraguay, known as Brasiguaios, {{in the city of}} Marechal CÃndido Rondon, in the West of the ParanÃ State. These people, looking for large and cheap lands, went in big groups to Paraguay between the 1970 s and 1980 s. Although there is not an accurate number, it is estimated that there were about five hundred thousand migrants {{in the middle of the}} 1980 s occupying the bordering regions of Paraguay with Brazil. However, in the 1990 s, it started an intensive return of these migrants because of a set of economic and political situations that directly affected them in that country. Many of them joined the Landless Worker Movement - MST. The last few decades, in an expressive way, these migrants have returned to the Brazilian cities bordering the regions where they lived in Paraguay. The way how they experiment and relate to the urban context, as well as, the way how they deal and cross such geographic, social and cultural borders are issues approached by this work. The narratives about these experiences reveal trajectories that are being made by the fact of âbeing hereâ and âbeing thereâ, negotiating and coexisting with different social values, identifications and belongings. These men and women look for, in the urban context, new spaces for work, medical assistance, social security and education. The return is many times motivated by the women, whose expectations surpass the material necessities. Therefore they see in the city a possible field to review their position in front of the performance, customs and codes established between genders relations lived in the border situations. Their memories also expressed the existence of sociability nets constructed in a distant time in front of the many needs. Among the needs, there is the necessity of work that has currently been, in the case of the men, the occupation of masons and construction assistant and the women work as house servant...|$|R
40|$|Anhand von Novellen, Romanen, Gedichten, Erzählungen und Dramen wird die Migrantenliteratur in Dänemark, Norwegen und Schweden beschrieben, Um nur eine kleine Auswahl der besprochenen Texte zu nennen, führe ich einige Titel auf: Michael Konupeks I sin tid, Adil Erdems Fremmedord, Janina Katz‘ Min moders datter, Gabriela Melinescus Hemma utomlands, Theodor Kallifatides Utlänningar oder Kirsten Thorups Projekt Paradis. Der Begriff „Migrantenliteratur“ erweist sich für das Vorhaben der vorliegenden Arbeit als der bestgeeignete, denn bloß durch die Anspielung auf die grenzüberschreitende Bewegung der Figuren oder der Sprecher, die dieser Begriff inne hat, kann man dem Textkorpus gerecht werden. Um eine holistische Betrachtung der Migrantenliteratur zu ermöglichen, werden gemeinsame Eigenschaften der Texte herausgearbeitet. Anhand von repräsentativen Texten wurden vier Ähnlichkeiten erkannt: die territoriale Grenze, die unbekannte Sprache, die Identitätssuche und die Bedeutung der Räume. Bereiche die in der Dissertation ebenfalls zur Diskussion gestellt werden, sind die Autobiographie und die Intertextualität. Des Öfteren wird Migrantenliteratur mit der autobiographischen Schreibform in Zusammenhang gebracht, ja sogar als Sonderform der Autobiographie betrachtet, doch es verhält sich anders. Unter den Werken der Migrantenliteratur befinden sich Autobiographien und autofiktionale Texte, sie repräsentieren jedoch nur einen Teil des Korpus. Alle Stränge in der Diskussion der Wittgensteinschen „Ähnlichkeiten“ und der einzelnen Texte führen dazu, dass man von Migrantenliteratur als literarischem Modell sprechen kann und es so möglich war, sie als ein Ganzes und Teil des literarischen Systems zu betrachten. In diesem Kontext und zum Zeitpunkt der vorliegenden Untersuchung wird Migrantenliteratur als eine Literatur verstanden, die „viele Grenzen überschritten hat, um die zu werden, die sie nun ist“. Sie ist an einem Punkt angekommen, an der man sie als ein Ganzes beschreiben kann, und sie wird fortgesetzt, denn ihr Potenzial ist noch nicht ausgeschöpft. Mit den Begriffen Itamar Even-Zohars aus Polysystem Theory kann man zusammenfassen, dass sich aus der Migrantenliteratur heraus und auf die Zentren des literarischen Systems Stellung nehmend ein weiteres literarisches Modell entwickelt, das auf ein Zentrum hinsteuert – es ist die Literatur über die Migranten der zweiten Generation. The {{dissertation}} “I crossed many {{borders to}} become who I am”. Main Aspects of the Scandinavian Migrant Literature describes {{on the basis}} of novellas, novels, poems, short stories and dramas the migrant literature in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with the purpose to can talk about this form of literature. I want to mention a few of the works that I used in order to do so: Michael Konupek’s I sin tid, Adil Erdem’s Fremmedord, Janina Katz‘ Min moders datter, Gabriela Melinescu’s Hemma utomlands, Theodor Kallifatide’s Utlänningar or Kirsten Thorup’s Projekt Paradis. The term “migrant literature” proves to be the proper term {{for the purpose of this}} work because only alluding to <b>transbordering</b> movements, which this term implicates, one can cope with the textcorpus. To facilitate a holistic view of the migrant literature common characteristics – and for this purpose Wittgenstein’s term “family resemblance” proves to be adequate for the discussion – of the texts in the corpus have to be elaborated. By means of representative texts four “family resemblances” for the “migrant texts” are identified: the territorial border, the foreign language, the finding of identity and the spaces. Another part of discussion in this dissertation is the autobiography because very often migrant literature is supposed to implicate autobiographical forms of writing, even considered to be one of its subgroups. Among migrant literature both autobiographies and autobiographical texts are indeed to be found, yet they represent only a part of the corpus. All the threads of the discussion prove that migrant literature can be considered a literary model and that is why it becomes possible to consider it an entity and a part of the literary system, using one of Itamar Even-Zohar’s literary terms. In this context and at this moment migrant literature is understood as a form of literature which “has crossed many borders to become what it is right now”, to use a quotation from one of the migrant texts used in the dissertation. It arrived at a point where it can be described as a whole and it is still in process because its possibilities are not exhausted yet. Using the terms borrowed from Itamar Even-Zohar and his Polysystem Theory it can be concluded that from the migrant literature steering to the centre a further literary model develops – it is the literature about the migrant of the second generation...|$|R

25|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement {{has a great}} {{influence}} on <b>transborder</b> trade in the San Diego–Tijuana economy. Of all the goods exchanged to the north 20% transported are destined for San Diego, 60% are destined for other California counties, and the remaining 20% are destined to other American states. The metropolitan economy has become increasingly integrated as the NAFTA process has reduced trade and investment barriers which facilitates the trade and extensive sales services via cross-border exchange. San Diego–Tijuana is a critical commercial link to the United States. In Tijuana, companies that have established assembly plants in industrial parks referred to as maquiladoras include Sony, Toyota, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, Nabisco, Philips, Pioneer, Plantronics, Pall Corporation, Tara Labs, and Sanyo, while San Diego supports the expansion of its own industrial parks in Otay Mesa.

Unlike other jetties, the <b>transborder</b> jetty requires passengers to go through security checkpoint C and then the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and lastly through the duty-free shop before accessing their gates. The gate area contains the same services as the other parts of the airport such as shops, restaurants, rest zones and cafés.

There is free Wi-Fi throughout the airport, luggage trolleys, ATMs and nursing rooms. When passengers arrive at Montréal-Trudeau from an international destination, they are welcomed into a huge and bright arrival complex, before passing through primary customs inspection, then go down one level to the baggage claim area and finally the international arrivals public area.

Works throughout the airport include showcases, illuminated columns, temporary exhibitions in the international arrival complex and permanent collection from various artists from the city.|$|E

Additionally, sections of the domestic area were renovated and expanded in 2007, accompanied with additional retail space. The International part of the Aeroquay satellite was demolished in 2008, leaving the domestic part for regional carriers. The completion of the CAD716 million expansion gives Montréal–Trudeau the ability to serve 15 million passengers a year. This ironically accomplished {{one of the goals}} that was to be met with {{the construction of}} Mirabel. (In the 1970s, the federal government projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal's airports annually by 1985, with 17 million through Mirabel). Aéroports de Montréal financed all of these improvements itself, with no government grants. By the end of 2007, CAD1.5 billion had been spent to upgrade Montréal–Trudeau.|$|E

Many connecting flights to Canadian centres were transferred to Mirabel and 23 international airlines moved their overseas activities there. As a consequence, the mission of Montréal–Dorval was redefined to service domestic flights and <b>transborder</b> flights to the United States. Mirabel's traffic decreased due to the advent in the 1980s of longer-range jets that {{did not need to}} refuel in Montreal before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Montreal's economic decline in the late 1970s and 1980s had a significant effect on the airport's traffic, as international flights bypassed Montreal altogether in favour of Toronto Pearson International Airport. The Trudeau government had developed Mirabel Airport to handle an expected growth in international traffic and eventually, to replace Dorval. The extra traffic never materialized and due to its closer proximity to downtown Montreal all scheduled air services have now returned to Dorval/Trudeau, while Mirabel ceased passenger operations in 2004. In May 2007 it was reported that the International Centre of Advanced Racing had signed a 25-year lease with Aéroports de Montréal to use part of the airport as a racetrack, the Circuit ICAR.
