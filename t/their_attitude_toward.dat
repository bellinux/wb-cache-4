25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how mental health professionals 2 ̆ 7 religiosity and gender related to <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> JSO treatment. Labeling theory provided the theoretical foundation for this study. This theory posits that individuals label certain populations, such as sex offenders, as deviant and this labeling perpetuates a cycle of criminal behavior. Using a quantitative approach, 123 mental health professionals completed an Internet survey that included demographic information, the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire, and the <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Toward</b> Treatment of Sex Offenders survey. These served to identify gender and measure religiosity and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> JSO treatment.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} examine the {{associations}} between prospective science teachers’ values (theoretical, religious, economic, aesthetic, social and political values) and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards science teaching. Cross-sectional research design was used. The adapted versions of Science Teaching Attitudes Scale (STAS-II) and Allport Vernon Lindzey Values Tests (SOV) were applied to 337 prospective science teachers. STAS-II and SOV were used for assessing prospective science teachers’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching and their values respectively. As a result of list-wise deletion, the sample appeared to include 281 prospective science teachers. The data were examined with correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The correlation analysis showed that prospective science teachers’ political, social, economic and aesthetic values were not significantly correlated with <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching at p<. 01 level. On the other hand, prospective science teachers’ theoretical values were positively associated with <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching (r= 0. 155, p<. 01). Moreover, prospective science teachers’ religious values were negatively correlated with <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching (r=- 0. 224, p<. 01). Multiple regression analysis also indicated that religious values of prospective science teachers were significant predictors of <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching (F (2, 280) = 14. 787, p<. 01). It can be concluded {{that there is a}} weak positive association between prospective science teachers’ theoretical values and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching. However, regression analysis reveals that theoretical value is not a significant predictor of <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching. As for significant predictors of prospective science teachers, it is found that religious values of prospective science teachers are significant predictors, which may negatively affect prospective science teachers’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching. So, it is suggested that science teachers must be aware that religion and science are two different ways of knowing. In this respect, the present study emphasizes the importance of explicitly discussing the different ways of knowing in science teacher training programs in order to neutralize the possible negative impacts of religious values of science teachers on <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> science teaching...|$|R
25|$|While repressive {{measures}} were relaxed {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a conversation on religious topics and beginning to proselytize after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. Another strategy was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. The Watchtower was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into Austria and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts. According to British political scientist Tom Gallagher, by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, {{as well as to}} Protestant denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant {{to take care of this}} group's religious needs. In an interview with the World Council of Churches' official magazine, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală of the dominant Romanian Orthodox Church said that gaining official recognition would have been very difficult for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the Communist state and to military service, but it would not have been impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's book is {{identified}} as distinctively English {{not only because of}} its style but also because of its themes of [...] "vigorous common sense", [...] "firm ethical fiber", [...] "serene reason and self-confidence", which are drawn from its Augustan literary roots. The [...] "muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies" [...] is equally a part of its Englishness, along with [...] "arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice". The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English; she alludes to tales from children's literature and others which date back to the medieval period. As Feeley notes, [...] "The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates Spenser and Shakespeare, and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland." [...] In these medieval English stories, the fairies are depicted as [...] "capricious, inconsistent in <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> humankind, [...] finally unknowable", characteristics which Clarke integrates into her own fairies. Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable, amoral fairies from the works of Neil Gaiman.|$|E

[...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label.

2500|$|After {{independence}} from France, young Cambodian intellectuals changed <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the clergy. In describing a general {{shift away from}} Buddhism in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Vickery cites the early work of anthropologist May Mayko Ebihara and his own observations. He suggests that the Khmer Rouge was able to instill antireligious feelings in younger males because the latter were losing interest in becoming monks even during their teenage years, the traditional temporary period of service. The monks themselves had abandoned some of their traditional restrictions and had become involved in politics. At intervals during the colonial period, some monks had demonstrated or had rebelled against French rule, and in the 1970s monks joined pro- government demonstrations against the communists. Anticlerical feelings reached their highest point among the Khmer Rouge, who at first attempted to indoctrinate monks and {{to force them to}} pass anticlerical ideas on to the laity. Under the Khmer Rouge regime, monks were expelled forcibly from the wats and were compelled to do manual labor. Article 20 of the 1976 Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea permitted freedom of religion but banned all reactionary religions, that were [...] "detrimental to the country." [...] The minister of culture stated that Buddhism was incompatible with the revolution and was an instrument of exploitation. Under this regime, to quote the Finnish Inquiry Commission, [...] "The practice of religion was forbidden and the pagodas were systematically destroyed." [...] Observers estimated that 50,000 monks died during the Khmer Rouge regime. The status of Buddhism and of religion in general after the Vietnamese invasion was at least partially similar to its status in pre-Khmer Rouge times.|$|E
