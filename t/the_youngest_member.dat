5|$|Danielle Beaubrun was {{the only}} Saint Lucian swimmer to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics. She was <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>member</b> of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18.

Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez.|$|E
5|$|In 1963–64, Chappell batted {{at number}} three for SA {{for the first}} time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out.

He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner.
