And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> time constraints that come with working with her that push you into different directions. [...] There are countless homages to pop culture of the past in this video. I think we were playing with Mod, and '60's and '80's iconic stuff that [...] responded to and related to." [...] She further said that during the filming Knowles put a lot of energy and made many decisions for the finished product.

2500|$|Gordon Murray {{analysed}} {{the car in}} Motor Trend 07/1990: [...] "It's {{the lack}} of weight that makes the Ferrari so exciting. There's nothing else magic about the car at all...They're asking two- and three-inch-diameter steel tubes at chassis base datum level {{to do all the}} work, and it shows - you can feel the chassis flexing on the circuit and it wobbles all over the place on the road. It really does shake about. And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one's like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it." [...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It's only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and rollbar. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> marketing Kevlar glues in with a quarter inch of rubber." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the game's release, PC Gamer writer Stefan Dorresteijn {{contacted}} professional eSports players and hosts for their opinions. Longtime eSports host Paul Chaloner stated that [...] " [...] needs a much better spectator system," [...] going on to elaborate, [...] "Right now, it's incredibly difficult for commentators and viewers to see {{the skills of the}} players: who used their ultimates and how did they interact? Who is on cooldown and who has changed hero?" [...] Fellow eSports player Seb Barton and Michael Rosen criticized the game's map designs and game modes; Barton remarked that [...] "the game modes are a little hit and miss," [...] adding that [...] "King of the hill [...] is super exciting and fast paced but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> payload [...] maps, which are just a snoozefest for everyone involved." [...] Rosen expressed a need for tweaking to the maps used for the control game mode, as they are [...] "just too prone to the snowball effect. The moment the attacking team captures the first control point they don't just have the momentum but also the last advantage for the second and final capture point." ...|$|E

5000|$|Wu Garden {{was built}} in the eighth or ninth year of the Daoguang Emperor (1828 or 1829).

Because at that time, the wealth of the Wu family was considered the greatest in Fucheng, so there was a local saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> wealth of lâu-á lāi, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> lâu-á lāi estate; If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> lâu-á lāi estate, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> wealth of lâu-á lāi 「有樓仔內的富，也無樓仔內的厝；有樓仔內的厝，也無樓仔內的富」".|$|R

60|$|That {{is another}} point to remember: all the Wood Folk are more curious about you {{than you are}} about them.

60|$|The majestic bluffs that {{overlook}} the river, along through this region, charm {{one with the}} grace and variety of their forms, and the soft beauty of their adornment. The steep verdant slope, whose base is at the water's edge is topped by a lofty rampart of broken, turreted rocks, which are exquisitely rich and mellow in color--mainly dark browns and dull greens, but splashed with other tints. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> shining river, winding {{here and there and}} yonder, its sweep interrupted at intervals by clusters of wooded islands threaded by silver channels; and you have glimpses of distant villages, asleep upon capes; and of stealthy rafts slipping along {{in the shade of the}} forest walls; and of white steamers vanishing around remote points. And it is all as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about it--nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon.|$|E

You precipitated the big closed-shop strike. Farburg betrayed that strike. You won, and the old American Federation of Labour crumbled to pieces. You follows destroyed it, and by so doing undid yourselves; for right on top of it began the organization of the I.L.W.--the biggest and solidest organization of labour the United States has ever seen, and you are responsible for its existence and for the present general strike.

6000|$|A {{period of}} supreme effort lies before you. The {{election}} with which this Parliament will close, and towards {{which we are}} moving, is one which is different in notable features from any other which we have known. Looking back over {{the politics of the}} last thirty years, we hardly ever see a Conservative Opposition approaching an election without a programme, on paper at any rate, of social and democratic reform. There was Lord Beaconsfield with his policy of [...] "health and the laws of health." [...] There was the Tory democracy of Lord Randolph Churchill in 1885 and 1886, with large, far-reaching plans of Liberal and democratic reform, of a generous policy to Ireland, of retrenchment and reduction of expenditure upon naval and military armaments--all promises to the people, {{and for the sake of}} which he resigned rather than play them false. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> elections of 1892 and 1895. In each the Conservative Party, whether in office or opposition, was, under the powerful influence of Mr. Chamberlain, committed to most extensive social programmes, of what we should call Liberal and Radical reforms, like the Workmen's Compensation Act and Old-Age Pensions, part of which were carried out by them and part by others.|$|E
6000|$|To begin with, {{there are}} various {{different}} attitudes that may be taken towards the same content. Let us suppose, {{for the sake of}} argument, that you have a visual image of your breakfast-table. You may expect it while you are dressing in the morning; remember it as you go to your work; feel doubt as to its correctness when questioned as to your powers of visualizing; merely entertain the image, without connecting it with anything external, when you are going to sleep; desire it if you are hungry, or feel aversion for it if you are ill.

[...] Philip was melted by kindness; {{it had never occurred}} to him that it mattered really to Mr. Perkins whether he went or stayed. He was touched and immensely flattered. It would be pleasant to end up his school-days with glory and then go to Oxford: in a flash there appeared before him the life which he had heard described from boys who came back to play in the O.K.S. match or in letters from the University read out in one of the studies. But he was ashamed; he would look such a fool in his own eyes if he gave in now; his uncle would chuckle at the success of the headmaster's ruse. It was rather a come-down from the dramatic surrender of all these prizes which were in his reach, because he disdained to take them, to the plain, ordinary winning of them. It only required a little more persuasion, just enough to save his self-respect, and Philip would have done anything that Mr. Perkins wished; but his face showed nothing of his conflicting emotions. It was placid and sullen.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Lightnings {{here are}} to be taken for the illuminations of the Spirit in the gospel (Heb 10:32). As it is said {{in the book of}} Psalms, 'They looked unto him,' on the throne, 'and were lightened' (Psa 34:5). Or, as it is said in other places, 'The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven, the {{lightnings}} lightened the world' (Psa 77:18). And again, 'His lightnings enlightened the world, the earth saw and trembled' (Psa 97:4). This lightning therefore communicates light to them that sit in darkness. 'God,' saith the apostle, 'who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ' (2 Cor 4:6). It was from this throne that the light came that struck Paul off his horse, when he went to destroy it and the people that professed it (Acts 9:3). These are those lightnings by which sinners are made to see their sad condition, and by which they are made to see the way out of it. Art thou then made to see thy condition how bad it is, and that the way out of it is by Jesus Christ? for, as I said, he is the throne of grace. Why then, come orderly in the light of these convictions to the throne from whence thy light did come, and cry there, as Samuel did to Eli, 'Here am I, for thou has called[13] me' (1 Sam 3:8). Thus did Saul by the light that made him see; by it he came to Christ, and cried, 'Who art thou, Lord?' and, 'What wouldst thou have me do?' (Acts 9:5,6). And is it not an encouragement to thee to come to him, when he lights thy candle that thou mightest see the way; yea, when he doth it on purpose that thou mightest come to him? 'He gives light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,' what to do? 'to guide our feet into the way of peace' (Luke 1:79). This interpretation of this place seems to me most to cohere with what went before; for first you have here a throne, and one sitting on it; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> elders, and in them presented to you the whole church, sitting round about the throne; then you have in the words last read unto you, a discourse how they came thither, and that is, by the lightnings, thunderings, and voices that proceed out of the throne.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> child's {{character}} in these four things--Humility, Faith, Charity, and Cheerfulness. That's {{what you have}} got to be converted to. 'Except ye be converted and become as little children'--You hear much of conversion now-a-days; but people always seem to think they have got to be made wretched by conversion,--to be converted to long faces. No, friends, {{you have got to}} be converted to short ones; you have to repent into childhood, to repent into delight, and delightsomeness. You can't go into a conventicle but you'll hear plenty of talk of backsliding. Backsliding, indeed! I can tell you, on the ways most of us go, the faster we slide back the better. Slide back into the cradle, if going on is into the grave--back, I tell you; back--out of your long faces, and into your long clothes. It is among children only, and as children only, that you will find medicine for your healing and true wisdom for your teaching. There is poison in the counsels of the men of this world; the words they speak are all bitterness, 'the poison of asps is under their lips,' but, 'the sucking child shall play by the hole of the asp.' There is death in the looks of men. 'Their eyes are privily set against the poor;' they are as the uncharmable serpent, the cockatrice, which slew by seeing. But 'the weaned child shall lay his hand on the cockatrice den.' There is death in the steps of men: 'their feet are swift to shed blood; they have compassed us in our steps like the lion that is greedy of his prey, and the young lion lurking in secret places,' but, in that kingdom, the wolf shall lie down with the lamb, and the fatling with the lion, and 'a little child shall lead them.' There is death in the thoughts of men: the world is one wide riddle to them, darker and darker as it draws to a close; but the secret of it is known to the child, and the Lord of heaven and earth is most to be thanked in that 'He has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them unto babes.' Yes, and there is death--infinitude of death in the principalities and powers of men. As far as the east is from the west, so far our sins are--not set from us, but multiplied around us: the Sun himself, think you he now 'rejoices' to run his course, when he plunges westward to the horizon, so widely red, not with clouds, but blood? And it will be red more widely yet. Whatever drought of the early and latter rain may be, there will be none of that red rain. You fortify yourselves, you arm yourselves against it in vain; the enemy and avenger will be upon you also, unless you learn that it is not out of the mouths of the knitted gun, or the smoothed rifle, but 'out of the mouths of babes and sucklings' that the strength is ordained which shall 'still the enemy and avenger.' ...|$|E
