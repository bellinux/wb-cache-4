50|$|The TSPS system {{utilized}} special analog trunks {{that originated}} at Class 5 end office circuit switch systems and Class 4 toll access circuit switch systems that {{were connected to}} Class 3 primary <b>toll</b> <b>circuit</b> switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and 4ESS switch systems. The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end office switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.|$|E
50|$|On July 16, 1920 the world's first {{commercial}} wireless radiotelephone <b>toll</b> <b>circuit</b> was {{opened to the}} public between San Pedro and Avalon. Designed by and installed under the direction of Western Electric Company/Bell Labs engineer Lewis M. Clement (1892-1979), the system drew other engineers {{from all over the world}} to study it. The Avalon telephone directory in 1920 listed 52 subscribers serviced by a manual switchboard. People stood for hours to use this new technology the only drawback of which was that all conversations could be monitored by anyone listening to their radio. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. solved that problem with the installation of two submarine cables running 23 miles from Avalon to San Pedro in 1923. Another communication first touched Catalina when the world's {{first commercial}} microwave telephone system was installed in 1946. Although microwave telephones had been used for wartime applications, this was the first peacetime use of this technology.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous complex {{dialling}} instructions {{appeared in}} the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to dial subscribers in local [...] "free calling" [...] areas, and in a few cases for short distance toll calls (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read meters in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were [...] "free", and still are for residential customers. Long distance or toll calls required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to <b>toll</b> <b>circuits,</b> either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling 0.|$|R

The integration of solar and mechanical energy harvesters along with the appropriate conditioning circuit into the main location system, {{are the key to}} reduce the dependence of batteries. Also, a <b>toll</b> detection <b>circuit</b> was added to provide information about crossing toll stations...|$|R
50|$|BTC has a {{telecommunications}} infrastructure {{that is one}} of the most modern in Africa. Its network, composed of an all-digital microwave and fibre optic system with digital exchanges at the main centres, provides a high quality service. The current network comprises 7 300 kilometers of microwave radio and fibre optic links between 12 main processors, each serving a specific area of the country. The switching units have a capacity of about 117 000 lines. Current services provided include national and international telephony, managed and data networks, very small aperture terminal (VSAT), private wires, leased <b>circuits,</b> <b>toll</b> free services, Internet, paging, public telephones, voice messaging, telex, packet switching, telegraph and customer premises. International access is provided from Botswana to almost every country in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The class 1 {{office was}} the Regional Center (RC). Regional centers served three {{purposes}} in the North American toll network (a) their connections were the [...] "last resort" [...] for final setup of calls when routes between centers {{lower in the}} hierarchy were not available (b) they were initially staffed by engineers who {{had the authority to}} block portions of the network within the region in case of emergencies or network congestion - although these functions were transferred after 1962 to the Network Control/Operations Center and the distributed Network Management Centers (see below) (c) they provided collection points (until the development of more advanced computer hardware and software for <b>toll</b> operators) for <b>circuits</b> that would be passed along to one of the international overseas gateways (which operated as special centers outside the formal North American hierarchy). The regional centers updated each other on the status of every circuit in the network. These centers would then reroute traffic around the trouble spots and keep each informed at all times. There were twelve Regional Centers in North America, ten in the United States, nine of which were operated by AT&T (White Plains, NY, Wayne, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Norway, IL rural crossroads west of Chicago at the intersection of US highway 52 and IL highway 71 - an underground office built with hardened construction to withstand nuclear attack, Conyers, GA in Rockdale County, St Louis, MO, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, and Sacramento, CA), one by GTE (San Bernardino, CA). Two centres in Canada were operated on behalf of the Trans-Canada Telephone System, one by Bell Canada (Montr√©al, PQ), and one by Saskatchewan Telephone, (Regina, SK).|$|R
