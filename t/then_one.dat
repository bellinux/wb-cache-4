2500|$|Chiricahua cousins are not {{distinguished}} from siblings through kinship terms. Thus, {{the same word}} will refer to either a sibling or a cousin (there are not separate terms for parallel-cousin and cross-cousin). Additionally, the terms are used according to {{the sex of the}} speaker (unlike the English terms brother and sister): -kʼis [...] "same-sex sibling or same-sex cousin", -´-ląh [...] "opposite-sex sibling or opposite-sex cousin". This means if one is a male, <b>then</b> <b>one's</b> brother is called -kʼis and one's sister is called -´-ląh. If one is a female, <b>then</b> <b>one's</b> brother is called -´-ląh and one's sister is called -kʼis. Chiricahuas in a -´-ląh relationship observed great restraint and respect toward that relative; cousins (but not siblings) in a -´-ląh relationship may practice total avoidance.|$|R

5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, <b>then</b> <b>one</b> of them will win.|$|E

50|$|After being {{virtually}} unbeatable in 2007, the Piranhas {{slumped in}} 2008; their unbeaten home record {{was taken in}} {{the first game of the}} new season following their shock 1-0 loss to Northern Virginia Royals, and they lost their second home game 2-0 to the Fredericksburg Gunners before finally notching up their first win, 3-0 over New Jersey Rangers at the end of May. Inconsistency plagued the Piranhas, who would win <b>one,</b> <b>then</b> lose <b>one,</b> <b>then</b> win <b>one,</b> <b>then</b> lose <b>one,</b> all year long. The high points were the victories over Richmond Kickers Future in the James River Cup - 3-1 away and 2-0 at home - whereas the low points included a disappointing 1-0 loss to bottom-of-the-table New Jersey Rangers in early June, and a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Fredericksburg Gunners in the penultimate game of the season. Having defeated all-comers in 2007, the Piranhas finished 2008 a disappointing third in the Mid Atlantic Division, out of the playoffs; Tom Woolard was the team's top scorer, with 5 goals, while Daniel Haywood and Josh Nolz each contributed three assists.|$|R

5|$|Work {{to improve}} the radar continued. An {{improved}} array was designed which covered 60 degrees rather than 30. The first Dnepr radar was built at Balkhash as a new radar, cell 5. It entered service on 12 May 1974. The second was a new early warning station at Sevastopol. New Dneprs were also built at Mishelevka and another at Skrunda, and <b>then</b> <b>one</b> at Mukachevo. The remaining radars were all converted to Dnepr {{with the exception of}} cells 3 and 4 at Balkhash and Mishelevka which remained space surveillance radars.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, and <b>then</b> <b>one</b> of the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece {{of one of the}} spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, <b>then</b> <b>one</b> of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, <b>then</b> <b>one</b> of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits.
