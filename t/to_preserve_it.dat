5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it</b> for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{there were}} 19 {{fatalities}} nationwide. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly threatened {{to shut down}} the game if drastic changes were not made. However, the threat by Roosevelt to eliminate football is disputed by sports historians. What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was, in fact, actually a fan of the sport and wanted <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it.</b> The President's sons were also playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Beachfields Park {{project was}} {{organised}} to publicise Beachfields' heritage and <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it</b> for future generations.

As {{part of the}} project, students wrote a book, Tales of Beachfields Park, which won the Historical Association Young Historian Primary School Award for Local History.|$|E

5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the Kuomintang, Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it</b> as a historical site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it {{and turned it into a}} national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} was uncertain whether {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it</b> intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it</b> in an animated film.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
