5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> as their fans and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head {{as a stage}} prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E

25|$|The Communist {{began on}} 5 August 1920, {{just four days}} after the {{completion}} of the conference (the Congress of London) which founded the CPGB. The publication continued without interruption until its 131st issue, dated 3 February 1923. The paper was in many ways a direct continuation of The Call, retaining <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> and style, the same editor, and even continuing the serialization of articles begun in the earlier publication.|$|E
25|$|An {{update to}} the BBC's {{graphics}} and playout systems in January 2007 also introduced new graphics for BBC News 24 {{and the news}} bulletins on BBC One. The new titles had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look,</b> feel and background reasoning as the previous but had been filmed again with new effects, while the graphics used maintained the previously introduced colour scheme. The new idents featured glossier graphics and rendering, with the ribbons being seen formed from different angles on the globe.|$|E

500|$|Herman Bang's {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Skørping Station {{in the north of}} Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her pale face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: [...] "For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> over Egnens Lyng — over the dreary plain." ...|$|E
500|$|In Resident Evil 5, Chris' {{increased}} {{muscle mass}} {{was to show}} that he had trained heavily in order to fight the series' powerful villain Albert Wesker bare-handed. Modeler Yosuke Yamagata added that they [...] "made a new design that retained their signature color—green for Chris, blue for Jill—to carry over <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> from the past. The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the GameCube version, and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure." [...] For the sixth main game, Chris has been redesigned slightly; he now has a slightly disheveled look due to his alcoholism and post-traumatic amnesia. In 2016, IGN made a video focusing on his evolution throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was {{directed}} by Mark Romanek over a course of six days at Universal Studios, Universal City, California. Madonna had first approached Romanek to direct the music video of her Erotica single, [...] "Bad Girl" [...] (1993). Romanek recalled in the DVD, The Work of Director Mark Romanek, that [...] "Bad Girl" [...] was ultimately directed by David Fincher, but he got later approached by the singer's team for [...] "Bedtime Story". Romanek contacted storyboard artist Grant Shaffer to create the storyboards for the video. He met with Romanek the next day, who played [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] for Shaffer and also showed him some photographs of Madonna, which {{were supposed to be}} used as the album cover. The surrealism inspired images portrayed a mystical looking Madonna, with white hair billowing behind her. Romanek wanted to have the music video capture <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look.</b> Madonna called from Florida and together with Romanek they described to Shaffer every aspect of the video, including budget and their concepts. For the next few days, Shaffer sketched the storyboards and faxed them to Romanek for review. About 20 days later, Shaffer dropped the final sketches at Propaganda Films, who were producing the video.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970). Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from [...] "the other side" [...] (death) echoes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked [...] "I see dead people" [...] in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{said that}} Tatsumi's art style and {{character}} designs reinforce {{the stories and}} that they linger in the reader's mind long after being read. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network found [...] "greater depth and variety" [...] than in The Push Man and Other Stories due to the larger amount of pages available, complimenting their simple layouts and executions, but disliked the endings {{as well as the}} repetitive character designs. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics praised Tatsumi's characterization and found the stories to be memorable, but found fault in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>look</b> of the characters. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called the stories [...] "a bit more ambitious and sure-footed" [...] than those in The Push Man and Other Stories. Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast felt that the longer stories in the manga allowed for more development than Tatsumi's earlier stories. Ng Suat Tong of The Hooded Utilitarian was critical of Tatsumi—feeling that the stories marked his transition into a rigorous artist, but disliking his repetitive themes and characters, concluding: [...] "These tales are neither close enough, true enough, sad enough nor vile enough to shock us from our modern stupor". In , Jason Thompson did not find the collection as powerful as The Push Man and Other Stories, but remarked that [...] "Tatsumi is a great storyteller and his pessimism is profound." [...] Dan Polley of Manga Life noted a departure by Tatsumi from his previous stories in The Push Man and Other Stories and called the stories [...] "Abandon the Old in Tokyo" [...] and [...] "Beloved Monkey" [...] the [...] "shining stars of the volume", concluding that his stories are timeless and have substance. Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the manga as [...] "remarkable, amazing", adding that [...] "the style is spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power". Austin Ramzy of Time Magazine noted that the manga remains relevant, calling it [...] "a revealing time capsule and a strangely moving portrait of survival in a land where everything is changing". Kirkus Reviews felt that the strong illustrations made the manga relatable and that it did not feel dated. Gordon Flagg of Booklist said that Tatsumi's [...] "powerful drawing style depicts the characters with a starkness and simplicity that matches what is presented of their lives and conjures a convincing urban milieu through detailed backdrops".|$|E

50|$|The Super Punch-Out!! arcade {{inspired}} {{the development and}} release of Super Punch-Out!! for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console in 1994. Several elements, such as opponents, were slightly changed for this version. Characters from both Punch-Out!! arcade games were featured in the game with basically <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>looks</b> and attacks. This version is the closest arcade-to-home console translation in the series; however, it isn't a direct port.|$|R
