5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected as men.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} {{brothers}} Christopher Arepa and Cru Omeka Kahui (20 March 2006 – 18 June 2006), two New Zealand infants from a Māori family {{who died in}} Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries, highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die {{as a result of}} abuse than non-Māori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report.|$|E
25|$|The {{data show}} that the Kohanim were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> belong to Haplogroup J than the average non-Cohen Jew. Of those who did belong to Haplogroup J, the Kohanim were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have an STR pattern close to the CMH-6, {{suggesting}} a much more recent common ancestry {{for most of them}} compared to an average non-Kohen Jew of Haplogroup J.|$|E
5000|$|A joint US-UK {{study shows}} that {{children}} are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> adults <b>to</b> catch H1N1.|$|R

5000|$|An exaggerated, phobic fear of {{mice and}} rats has {{traditionally}} been depicted as a stereotypical trait of women, with numerous books, cartoons, television shows, and films portraying women screaming and jumping onto chairs or tables {{at the sight of}} a mouse [...] - [...] for example, Mammy Two Shoes in Tom and Jerry. Despite the gender-stereotype portrayal Western murophobia has always been experienced by individuals of both sexes, however women are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> suffer from specific phobias, such as musophobia.|$|R
25|$|Men are 89% {{more likely}} than women to be {{diagnosed}} with, and are almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die of, these cancers.|$|E
25|$|People with {{diabetes}} who have neuropathic {{symptoms such as}} numbness or tingling in feet or hands are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be unemployed as those without the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Australians were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{report their}} health as fair/poor and 1.5 {{times more likely}} to have a {{disability}} or long-term health condition (after adjusting for demographic structures).|$|E
50|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} {{and school}} dropout {{are a significant}} problem in Canada. In 2010 37% of youth self-reported engaging {{in one or more}} delinquent behaviors such as acts of violence, acts against property, and the sale of drugs. Canadian boys are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> girls <b>to</b> engage in violent behavior but about equal in crimes against property. In 2010 the rate of those accused of a crime peaked at 18 years of age and generally decreased with age.School dropout rates between 2009 and 2010 were around 10% of young males and 7% of young women. Only 44% of children in foster care graduate from high school compared to 81% of their peers.|$|R
2500|$|Self-report surveys {{suggest that}} half of all 15- to 19-year-olds have had oral sex. That {{percentage}} rises to 70% {{by the time they}} turn 19, and equal numbers of boys and girls participate. Research indicating that oral sex is less risky to teens' emotional and physical well being than vaginal sex has been advanced; researchers at the University of California do not believe this conclusion is warranted. They found that oral sex, as well as vaginal sex, was associated with negative consequences. Of adolescents engaging in oral sex only, girls were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> boys <b>to</b> report feeling bad about themselves and nearly three times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> feel used. Despite their behaviors, 90% of adolescents [...] "agree that most young people have sex before they are really ready." ...|$|R
50|$|Youth who {{reported}} {{having sex with}} {{both males and females}} are at the greatest risk for disordered eating, unhealthy weight control practices compared to youth who only have same- or other-gender sex. Bisexual women are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> lesbians <b>to</b> have an eating disorder and, if they are out, <b>to</b> be <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> heterosexual women <b>to</b> have an eating disorder.|$|R
25|$|Those {{who have}} already had a {{fracture}} are at least <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have another fracture compared to someone {{of the same age}} and sex. Early menopause/hysterectomy is another predisposing factor.|$|E
25|$|Preterm birth. Low {{birth weight}} and preterm birth are {{strongly}} associated with many health problems, such as visual impairment and cerebral palsy, and children born after IVF are roughly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have cerebral palsy.|$|E
25|$|People with {{vaginismus}} are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have {{a history}} of childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Girls are [...] "at {{particular}} {{risk for}} experiencing negative {{social and emotional}} consequences of having any type of sex," [...] including oral sex. Girls are more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> boys <b>to</b> say they felt bad about themselves and {{more than three times}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> say they felt used as a result of engaging in sex or hookups.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Patients {{presenting}} to an Emergency Department {{were assessed}} by a standard questionnaire and clinical examination {{as to the}} contribution that alcohol made to their presentation {{and the perception of}} their alcohol use. Patients {{under the influence of alcohol}} are more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> not <b>to</b> fill in simple questionnaires and not to perceive their alcohol consumption as different from non-drinking fellows. Emergency Departments are not the optimal site for the education and motivation of drinking patients to alter their future habits...|$|R
50|$|Males are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> females <b>to</b> {{have this}} characteristic, and {{it tends to}} run in {{families}}. In its non-symptomatic form, it is more common among Asians and Native Americans than among other populations, and in some families {{there is a tendency}} to inherit the condition unilaterally, that is, on one hand only.|$|R
25|$|APD {{can affect}} both {{children}} and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It {{has been suggested that}} males are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected by the disorder as females, but there are no good epidemiological studies.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that tobacco smokers who are exposed to residential radon are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop lung cancer as non-smokers. As well, {{the risk of developing}} lung cancer from asbestos exposure is twice as likely for smokers than for non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|A {{few cases}} of maternal-fetal {{transmission}} (a baby acquires leukemia because its mother had leukemia during the pregnancy) have been reported. Children born to mothers who use fertility drugs to induce ovulation {{are more than}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop leukemia during their childhoods than other children.|$|E
50|$|Some older {{analyses}} {{have claimed}} that non-smokers are up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> smokers <b>to</b> develop Alzheimer's disease. However, a more current analyse found {{that most of the}} studies, which showed a preventing effect, had a close affiliation to the tobacco industry. Researches without tobacco lobby influence have concluded the complete opposite: Smokers are almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> non smokers <b>to</b> develop Alzheimer's disease.|$|R
5000|$|Jenny Earle, {{director}} of Prison Reform Trust’s programme for reducing women’s imprisonment in response said, [...] "The evidence {{is not that}} women are treated more leniently. In fact they are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> receive a custodial sentence for a first offence, and the main offence for which women are imprisoned is theft and shoplifting".|$|R
40|$|The UN Development Report[2] just {{published}} provides ample statistical proof, as Paul Vallely of the British daily Independent points out, {{that for many}} ―well beyond those affected by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina― the great American Dream is an ongoing nightmare. It reveals for instance that the infant mortality rate has been rising in the US {{for the past five}} years - and is now the same as Malaysia, whereas America's black children are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> whites <b>to</b> die before their first birthday. It is therefore clear that even the UN —not exactly a radical organization— recognizes now that a system which relies on private business will create huge inequalities depriving millions of people, in the only superpower left, from full access to health, education and other social provision...|$|R
25|$|A British {{study of}} almost 10,000 men {{found that those}} who gave up meat were almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suffer from {{depression}} as people on a conventional balanced diet. The study found that the 350 committed vegetarians studied had a higher average depression score compared to others.|$|E
25|$|In the US, men {{are over}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use {{marijuana}} as women and 18-29 year-olds are six {{times more likely}} to use as over 65-year-olds. In 2015, a record 44% of the US population has tried marijuana in their lifetime, an increase from 38% in 2013 and 33% in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifetime}} risk of suicide {{among people with}} BPD is between 3% and 10%. There is evidence that men diagnosed with BPD are approximately <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die by suicide as women diagnosed with BPD. There is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who die by suicide may have undiagnosed BPD.|$|E

50|$|In the US, 6.8% {{of adults}} will {{experience}} PTSD in their lifetimes with women <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> experience it (10.4% to 5%) frequently {{as a result}} of sexual trauma. Veterans are another group highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience PTSD during their lives, with Vietnam War veterans at 30%, Gulf War veterans at 10%, and Iraq War veterans at 14%.|$|R
50|$|Mark Avrum Ehrlich of The Encyclopedia of the Jewish diaspora: origins, experiences, {{and culture}} writes that as Jews find {{themselves}} in Canada's contemporary wealthy elite, as 20 percent of the wealthiest Canadians were listed as Jewish. La Griffe du Lion cites the 23% of the top 100 wealthiest Canadians are Jewish. In 2004, Nadav ʻAner, author of The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute cited that Canadian Jews are better educated and more financially off {{than the general population}} and have high political influences in the Canadian parliament. Jews are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> non-Jews <b>to</b> get a bachelor's degree and are three times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> in the aged 25-34 cohort. This translates into a higher standard of living and they are financially better off than overall Canadian population. Canadian Jews are also three times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> earn over $75,000 compared to their non-Jewish counterparts.|$|R
25|$|Alcoholism in {{ancestors}} was a factor. Men {{with several}} alcohol-abusing ancestors (i.e. {{not members of}} immediate family) were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become alcoholics as those with none. The presence of an alcoholic parent increased the risk of alcoholism by three times, {{although it was not}} clear from the data if the factors were genetic or environmental.|$|E
25|$|According to Hartmann (1982), {{the women}} who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time {{suggests}} that financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> seek jobs.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{fraternity}} men {{are three times}} more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses. Fraternities have often been accused of fostering rape-supportive attitudes by promoting male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation has been found to be a significant predictor of sexually predatory behavior in retrospective research. Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience rape than other college women.|$|E
50|$|Students' {{aspirations}} to pursue careers {{in mathematics and}} science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas {{and the level of}} effort they put forth in these courses. A report by the U.S. Department of Education found that the gap in the career aspirations of boys and girls in STEM fields exists as early as eighth grade. Among the eighth grade class of 1988, boys were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> girls <b>to</b> aspire to be scientists or engineers (9 and 3 percent, respectively), although girls were more <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> aspire to professional, business, or managerial occupations (38 and 20 percent respectively). While male and female high school seniors are equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> expect a career in science or mathematics, male seniors are much more likely than their female counterparts to expect a career in engineering.|$|R
50|$|Both {{genes and}} hormones affect the {{formation}} of human brains before birth, {{as well as the}} behavior of adult individuals. Several genes that code for differences between male and female brains have been identified. In the human brain, a difference between sexes was observed in the transcription of the PCDH11X/Y gene pair, a pair unique to Homo sapiens. It has been argued that the Y chromosome is primarily responsible for males being more susceptible to mental illnesses. Several psychological studies contradict this however, as it has been found that women are actually more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> be susceptible to depressive episodes and generalized anxiety, and additionally that progesterone levels in females actually stall the body's ability to turn off stressor hormones resulting in women entering depressive episodes at even lower levels of stress than men.|$|R
50|$|Bladder {{symptoms}} affect {{women of}} all ages. However, bladder problems are most prevalent among older women. Women {{over the age of}} 60 years are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> experience incontinence; one in three women over the age of 60 years are estimated to have bladder control problems. One reason why women are more affected is the weakening of pelvic floor muscles by pregnancy.|$|R
