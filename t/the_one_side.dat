5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions {{to the war in}} Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Caseros the San Nicolás Agreement was signed. It {{was meant to}} comply with the {{constitutional}} mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation, convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe. This agreement was not accepted by the province of Buenos Aires, since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces. Buenos Aires thereupon seceded from the confederation, thus Argentina got divided into two rival, independent states which fought to establish dominance. On <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. On the other, the Autonomists of Buenos Aires. The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory of Buenos Aires over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón. The bonaerense liberal leader Bartolomé Mitre was elected the first President of a united Argentine Republic in 1862.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} contact is <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> most primary elements {{to affect the}} reliability of the electric systems. Gold finish can maintain high contact reliability but increase the manufacture cost. In this paper, <b>the</b> effects of <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold plated contacts with various thickness of gold finish on the contact reliability were investigated. The failure mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold plated contacts under fretting conditions was analyzed. The contact life and the optimum thickness of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold finish under fretting conditions was achieved and compared. The effect of the curvature of the probes on the contact life was also discussed...|$|R

5|$|When US-89 {{was created}} in 1926, it only went {{as far north as}} Spanish Fork, where {{travelers}} could continue to Salt Lake City via US-91. The highway was extended north to the Canada–US border near Glacier National Park in the mid-1930s, though a dispute between Utah and Idaho on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and Wyoming on the other was not settled until 1938. The American Association of State Highway Officials decided in favor of Utah and Idaho, placing US-89 on or near US-91 between Spanish Fork and Logan, where it split northeasterly to Yellowstone National Park. (US-89 only left US-91 twice: between Farmington and Ogden, where it still travels today, and via an all-weather route from Brigham City into the Cache Valley, now SR-38 and SR-30.) Wyoming's preferred routing, which left US-91 at Provo, instead became US-189. Beginning in the 1950s, Interstate 15 was constructed, replacing US-91 for through traffic south of Brigham City, and leading to that route's truncation there in 1974. On the other hand, US-89 follows independent corridors south of Spanish Fork and north of Logan. It has not been truncated, and mostly follows US-91's final alignment, except between Farmington and Ogden (where old US-91 is now I-15, SR-126, and SR-26).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>One</b> of <b>the</b> corollaries of Ornstein’s {{isomorphism}} theorem {{is that if}} (Y, S, ν) is an invertible measure preserving {{transformation and}} (Y, S 2, ν) is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift then (Y, S, ν) is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift. In this paper we show that noninvert-ible transformations do not share this property. We do this by exhibiting a uniformly 2 - 1 endomorphism (X, σ, µ) which is not isomorphic to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> Bernoulli 2 shift. However (X, T 2, µ) is isomorphic to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> Bernoulli 4 shift. 1...|$|R
