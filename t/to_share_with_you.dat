6000|$|... "Heaven help me, sir!--I was far, just then, from {{thinking}} {{of any such}} thing! I was fancying how little I should have thought it probable, when we were together in the Calypso, that I should ever be thus standing at your bed-side. Really, Admiral Bluewater, I would rejoice <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> the remnant of life that is left me." ...|$|E

My father has been long noted a worthy and honourable man; and for Tressilian, if we can pardon ourselves the ill we have wrought him, I will wager the coronet I am <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> one day that he is incapable of returning injury for injury." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Well, if our {{calculations}} as to {{the value}} of the cargoes and ships are correct, you will get more than ten times that amount now. And as there are only the flag and one other officer <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> the men’s portion will be something like £100 apiece. A few more captures like this,” and he laughed, “and you will become a rich man.” ...|$|E

"Mr. Ledsam," [...] he said, [...] "I told you, {{some little}} time ago, {{that so far}} as this {{particular}} case was concerned I had no confidences <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I am sorry that you saw that letter. Since you did, however, I hope you will not {{take it as a}} liberty from one in my position if I advise you most strenuously to do nothing which might impede the course of the law. Good day, sir!" ...|$|E

'It was my desire, is my desire, <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> what I {{have that}} is best; and that, I take it, {{is not the}} least {{valuable}} of my possessions, such as they are! And why not? You have given to me all that makes life sweet; without which it would be unbearable. That child who came to {{my wife and me}} when I was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to us both. Had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments when my child was quivering between life and death, I would have cheerfully purchased them with not half but all! Sir, I should have given my soul! I can say this now, for gratitude is above all barter; and surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of his child!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "With {{regard to}} myself, I find that {{traveling}} at twenty and forty {{are very different}} things. I set out with all my confirmed habits about me, and can find nothing on the Continent so good as when I formerly left it. One of our chief amusements here is scolding at everything we meet with, and praising everything and every person we left at home. You may judge, therefore, whether your name is not frequently bandied at table among us. To tell you the truth, I never thought I could regret your absence so much as our various mortifications on the road have often taught me to do. I could tell you of disasters and adventures without number; of our lying in barns, and of my being half poisoned with a dish of green peas; of our quarreling with postilions, and being cheated by our landladies; but I reserve all this for a happy hour which I expect <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> upon my return.|$|E
60|$|The {{photograph}} is wonderful and beautiful--and a mockery! I mean encompassed {{with such an}} ache and such a pang that it sets up for one's vision a regularly accepted, unabated pain. And now you have another of like sort, the fruit of this horrible time--which I presume almost <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{as a sign of}} the tenderness I bear you. I wish indeed that for this I might once have seen D. B., kind brothering D. B., the reading by you of whose letter last night, under the pang of his extinction, the ghost telling of the ghost, moved me more than I could find words for. He brothered you almost as much as he had brothered Rupert--and I could almost feel that he practically a little brothered poor old me, for which I so thank his spirit! And this now the end of his brothering! Of anything more in his later letter that had any relation you will perhaps still some day tell me....|$|E

"Ladies {{and gentlemen}} of the Sixteenth Ward, there is one who cannot be with us here to-night, a man than whom there is no more stalwart Trojan in all the {{political}} arena--I refer to our leader, the Honorable Lucas Prout, standard-bearer of the city and county of Zenith. Since he is not here, I trust that you will bear with me if, as a friend and neighbor, as one who is proud <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> the common blessing of being a resident of the great city of Zenith, I tell you in all candor, honesty, and sincerity how the issues of this critical campaign appear to one plain man of business--to one who, brought up to the blessings of poverty and of manual labor, has, even when Fate condemned him to sit at a desk, yet never forgotten how it feels, by heck, to be up at five-thirty and at the factory with the ole dinner-pail in his hardened mitt when the whistle blew at seven, unless the owner sneaked in ten minutes on us and blew it early!
