September 20, 1943 Dear friends, Just a {{few lines}} to {{acknowledge}} your letter enclosing a list of my classmates who are now serving their country. It is good to hear about them and to know they are doing well. As for yours truly, I am still fighting the “battle of the Elizabeth River” in Norfolk, but now have my wife with me and we are living at the above address. My work as Operation’s Officer and Military Duty Officer is very interesting, and they are adding more and more work from day to day. The Operation’s Officer is responsible for berthing, unberthing, docking and undocking of ships. The pilots and <b>tugmasters</b> take orders from the Captain of the Yard’s Office of which I am a member. A Military Duty Officer {{is part of the}} Security Group and the duties are similar in scope to an Officer of the Deck on board ship. He is called an Officer of the Day in Army terminology. Mr. Shors was in the office the other day and has since had leave visiting Bryant, I believe. We have an invitation to visit his home in Portsmouth in the near future and are looking forward to talking over old times at Bryant. He taught my nephew, George Scothon, now a member of the Finance Group in Australia and a recent Bryant Graduate. Undoubtedly you have heard about Lt. Wesley Crawley, Class of 1936, who was taken prisoner by Germans and dropped on an island. He was picked up by the British and is now safe. He was listed as missing in action, and has since been made a 1 st Lieutenant. Remember me to all, and keep the letters coming. I am not a cigarette smoker so send my share to some of the other boys. Sincerely,J. B. Howarth P. S. Forgive the hint—I do smoke a pipe and cigars. [Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) -technology has {{received}} increased industrial interest {{during the last}} three decades. This is because utilisation of RFID is related to opportunities to increase logistical efficiency (in terms of reduced time and costs) in logistics operations, reduce risk of theft, control goods-characteristics (temperature, humidity), and in tracking and tracing of goods to ensure and preserve the safety and quality of goods in supply chains. In addition, previous studies in the area present logistics benefits in implementing the Electronic Product Code Information Service framework. This report focuses on potential impacts on logistics operations and opportunities in implementation of RFID technology and the EPCIS-framework to ensure unique identification of trailers at DFDS Seaways. The purpose is to investigate how RFID and EPCIS can be used for handling of trailers in port-areas. The report presents findings from literature reviews and a case study that investigated four research questions. The first question embraces potential logistics operations affected by implementation of EPCIS framework. The second question explores RFID-technology, suitable for unique identification of trailers in the two harbours Rotterdam and Immingham. The third question concerns the potential physical location of RFID technology on trailers and in the two port-areas. Finally, the fourth question explores potential business benefits in implementing a RFID-based identification system of trailers at DFDS terminals in Rotterdam and Immingham. The results show that logistics operations of identification, inspection, registering, picking, loading, un-loading, storage, and distribution of trailers are affected by implementation of the EPCIS framework, which is important for DFDS in management of trailers. RFID-tags suitable in identification of trailers are either passive or active. Similarly, the variety of RFIDreaders ranges from hand-held RFID-scanners to RFID-portals. The choice of RFIDtechnology should be based on the use of communication standards, presence of metal, and costs. The results show several potential physical locations on trailers, <b>tugmasters,</b> and in the Rotterdam and Immingham port-areas to place RFID-technology. Business benefits of implementing a RFID based identification system in Rotterdam and Immingham can be drawn from more effective logistics operations and reducing errors and problems occuring such as forbidden parking of trailers, language problems, service in self-service files, inspection and labelling of trailers. The report also examines the knowledge about RFIDtechnology among employees working with handling of trailers in the two ports Rotterdam and Immingham. The results presented contribute to the understanding of implementation of RFID-technology and the EPCIS-framework in handling of trailers within port-areas from a managerial point of view. This is useful for DFDS as well as for academia, since it shows that RFID-based and standardised solutions should be prioritised to influence future setups and theoretical development of the logistics research area...|$|R

50|$|When the Auster AOP.9 was {{introduced}} into British Army service from 1959 Auster Aircraft bought all the surviving and now surplus Auster AOP.6 and T.7s. Most were converted as three-seater touring aircraft for civilian use as the Auster 6B, later Beagle A.61 Terrier, {{but a number}} of airframes were modified for glider towing as the Auster 6A <b>Tugmaster.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hoga was moored {{with other}} yard service craft near the drydocks at 1010 Dock when Pearl Harbor was {{attacked}} by Japanese forces {{on the morning of}} 7 December 1941. Ten of Hogas eleven-man crew were aboard; the cook was ashore. As the planes swooped in over the harbor, Assistant <b>Tugmaster</b> Robert Brown, sleeping in the pilothouse, was awakened by the dropping bombs. [...] "I raised up and looked out and all hell was breaking loose. I saw planes all over the place. Japanese planes and several ships on fire." [...] Chief Boatswain's Mate Joseph B. McManus, the <b>Tugmaster,</b> was shaving in his cabin. [...] "I heard the noise and I looked out the porthole...and the first sight I saw was the Oklahoma which had quite a list. She had been hit ... The Chief Engineer was standing on the dock and I heard him say, 'My God! This is war! ...|$|E
50|$|The Auster <b>Tugmaster</b> is a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with a fixed tailwheel {{landing gear}} and {{powered by a}} de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. The Tugmasters had their engines modified to civilian standards as the Gipsy Major 10 and they were also fitted with larger tail surfaces. Because of the original radio fit had been removed the second passenger sat in a sideways-facing seat behind the pilot and not side-by-side although three aircraft were fitted with dual controls and side-by-side seating.|$|E
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{touched off}} {{oil from the}} ruptured tanks of the Arizona which in turn caused fires on board Vestal, aft and amidships. At 08:45 men forward cut Vestals mooring lines with axes, freeing her from the Arizona, and she got underway, steering by engines alone. The naval tug Hoga, the <b>tugmaster</b> had served aboard the Vestal {{just a few months}} before the attack, pulled Vestals bow away from the inferno engulfing Arizona and the repair ship, and the latter began to creep out of danger, although she was slowly assuming a list to starboard and settling by the stern. At 09:10, Vestal anchored in 35 ft of water off McGrews Point.|$|E
5000|$|From Nevada, Hoga {{returned}} to Battleship Row, fighting fires on , , and finally Arizona. Hoga worked the Arizona fire from 16:00 hours on Sunday until 13:00 hours on Tuesday, 9 December. [...] "We didn't recover any bodies", said Assistant <b>Tugmaster</b> Brown, [...] "We {{were not in}} a position to do that. We had more important work to do.... There were dead bodies on there. We could see them up on the mainmast." [...] Following 72 continuous hours of firefighting, Hoga remained on active duty through the rest of the week, patrolling the harbor, assisting in body removal, and searching for Japanese submarines believed to be hiding in the harbor. The actions of the tug's skipper and crew did not go unrecognized. On February 1942, Admiral Chester Nimitz, CINCPAC, commended McManus, his men, and their tug for a job well done: ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the result of}} a graduation project on the behaviour of a harbour <b>tugmaster</b> and his tug. First, research is described which has been conducted into the behaviour of a <b>tugmaster.</b> Based on this study a model has been developped to generate realistic tracks of a tugboat. This can be used to generate automatic tugboat assistence of a vessel simulated on a "Full Mission Bridge Simulator". The model is described in detail and simulation results are discussed. The results have been validated by expert judgement of tugmasters. It is concluded that the model generates realistic manoeuvres. It is capable of avoiding collisions with objects in its environment.
