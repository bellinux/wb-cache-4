5|$|In 1954, {{six months}} after the battle at Điện Biên Phủ ended, <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> War started, and by 1956, both the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates had gained independence. A French board of inquiry, the Catroux Commission, later {{investigated}} the defeat.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the Barbary states took {{advantage}} of the weakness of the United States Navy to again capture American merchant ships and sailors. After the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the United States looked at ending the piracy in the Mediterranean which had plagued American merchants for two decades. On 3 March 1815, the U.S. Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, beginning the Second Barbary War. Two powerful squadrons under the command of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge, including the 74-gun ships of the line , , and , were dispatched to the Mediterranean. Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur's squadron encountered <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> flagship Meshuda, and, in the Action of 17 June 1815, captured it. Not long afterward, the American squadron likewise captured <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos. By June, the squadrons had reached Algiers and peace was negotiated with the Dey, including a return of captured vessels and men, a guarantee of no further tributes and a right to trade in the region.|$|E

She was hulked in 1936 and scrapped in 1941–44.|$|E
5|$|For Vendetta, {{stores were}} stockpiled in Algerian ports and Allied troops were given maps for the {{supposed}} landing zones. A naval exercise, involving sixty ships, was run between 9 and 11 June which included embarking {{thousands of men}} and vehicles from the US 91st Infantry Division. On 11 June, <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> borders were closed, a natural precursor to invasion.|$|E
5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France.

5|$|Andry Rajoelina {{was born}} on 30 May 1974 to a {{relatively}} wealthy family in Antananarivo.

At the age of 13, Rajoelina became the 1987 junior-class national karate champion. While still in high school, Rajoelina began working as a disc jockey at parties and clubs in Antananarivo to earn pocket money. Although Rajoelina's family could afford a college education for their son, he opted to discontinue his studies after completing his baccalaureat to launch a career as an entrepreneur.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were directly involved in the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt's {{acceptance}} by the Qadiriyya, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration {{that she was}} a spy or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901 the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her long-time partner, <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General Hubert Lyautey. In 1904, at the age of 27, she was killed by a flash flood in Aïn Sefra.|$|E

50|$|Lutaud {{declared}} that <b>the</b> <b>Algerians</b> were not essentially {{inferior to the}} French, but were backward, and the French had a duty to educate them. He used this backwardness {{as an excuse for}} discriminatory policies. He said that he had a profound confidence in the unity of the human race, and expected that by progressive steps <b>the</b> <b>Algerians</b> would be able to receive the same rights as the French. The steps would be slow but sure. Their children would eventually receive the same education as the French, and they would eventually receive the franchise. Any resistance by <b>the</b> <b>Algerians</b> to becoming French was just evidence of their backwardness.Once the indigenous people had become French, they would cease to be indigenous.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country was satisfied with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abu Ali Iyad {{was born}} in Qalqilyah in the modern-day West Bank when Palestine was under the British Mandate.

A year later, he moved to Baquba, Iraq where he {{enrolled}} in a teacher training program. He left Iraq the same year, moving to Saudi Arabia to teach there afterward. In 1962, he had a job as a teacher in Algeria. However, he soon sought and received training by <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> Army, graduating from its training course in the summer of 1964.|$|E

5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris {{became one}} front of <b>the</b> <b>Algerian</b> War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN {{targeted}} and killed 11 Paris policemen, {{leading to the}} imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|Other postcolonial {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} Shakespeare's audiences would have connected Sycorax {{with the threat of}} Islamic expansionism. Islam had successfully conquered and colonised much of the Middle East and some of southern Europe during the Middle Ages. <b>The</b> <b>Algerian</b> Sycorax may represent Christian Europe's fear of Islam and its growing political power. This interpretation inverts the traditional postcolonial interpretations of The Tempest, however. If Sycorax is viewed as an Islamic expansionist, then she herself is the coloniser, not Prospero (who becomes merely a re-colonizer of the island). However, Sycorax's portrayal as an absent, silent woman still allows the play to solidify the idea of European over Islamic power.|$|E
