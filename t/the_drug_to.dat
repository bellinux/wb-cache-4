5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. Broken down into ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be a chimeric monoclonal antibody {{used on the}} cardiovascular system. This {{and the following two}} names would look the same if the new convention were applied.|$|E
5|$|Grant Ellis {{is taken}} to Susanne Modeski by Scully so she can confront him about why he gave <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> the {{government}}. She is furious as {{she could have been}} killed had she not checked Langly the night before. Ellis admits that he only betrayed her because the government threatened his own life. Timmy arrives, guns down Grant Ellis, and takes Susanne to the Lone Gunmen's suite.|$|E
5|$|Rozrolimupab is a {{polyclonal}} antibody. Broken {{down into}} rozro-lim-u-pab, its name shows <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> {{be a human}} polyclonal antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab shows it is a polyclonal antibody.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and {{encouraging them to}} publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E

5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> the troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

50|$|After leaving office, Gomes faced a {{legal issue}} {{regarding}} 734 kilograms {{of drugs that}} disappeared while he was Prime Minister. According to Gomes, he had ordered <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> be stored by the Treasury for safekeeping.|$|R
25|$|Artemisinins are {{not used}} for malaria {{prophylaxis}} (prevention) because of the extremely short activity (half-life) of <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> <b>To</b> be effective, {{it would have to}} be administered multiple times each day.|$|E
25|$|In the deposition, Cosby {{denied any}} sexual assault of any women but {{admitted}} that he had used sedatives to help gain their cooperation. He testified that he had obtained Quaaludes from gynecologist Leroy Amar, who knew that Cosby had no intention of taking the drugs himself. Cosby instead intended to give them to women he wanted to have sexual relations with and {{admitted that he}} had given <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> at least one woman and other people. Cosby admitted knowing it was illegal at the time to dispense <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> other people. Amar would later have his medical license revoked in California and New York; he died in 2002.|$|E

25|$|General {{anesthesia}} is not maintained with barbiturate drugs. An induction dose of thiopental {{wears off}} {{after a few}} minutes because the thiopental redistributes from the brain {{to the rest of the}} body very quickly. However, it has a long half-life, which means that a long time is needed for <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated from the body. If a very large initial dose is given, little or no redistribution takes place (since the body is saturated with the drug), which means that recovery of consciousness requires <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated from the body, which is not only slow (taking many hours or days), but unpredictable in duration, making barbiturates very unsatisfactory for maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The i.m. {{administration}} of 75–500mg of synephrine did not relieve acute asthma attacks, contradicting an earlier claim. However, the topical application of 1–3% solutions of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> the nasal mucosa {{of patients with}} sinusitis did produce a beneficial constriction without local irritation.|$|E
25|$|He {{goes on to}} {{lament the}} fact that as of his writing, little to no {{research}} has been done on apomorphine or variations of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> study its effects on curing addiction, and perhaps the possibility of retaining the positive effects while removing the side effect of vomiting.|$|E

25|$|Mescaline has a {{wide array}} of {{suggested}} medical usage, including treatment of alcoholism and depression. However, its status as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances limits availability of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> researchers.
