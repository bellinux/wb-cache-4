40|$|The {{monitoring}} of air quality to develop meaningful air programs and policies {{has been an}} on-going initiative {{in the province of}} Ontario, Canada. Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on air quality throughout the province since the 1970 s. In 1993 the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) embarked on its first effort to inventory Ontario’s point source emissions {{through the use of a}} voluntary survey. This survey was distributed annually to industrial facilities throughout the province, requesting annual activity data for the estimation of Ontario facility air emissions. This exercise consistently yielded a low response from Ontario point sources. In January of 2000, the MOE proposed an air quality initiative that would consist of a regulation requiring the mandatory monitoring and reporting of air emissions from point sources. This proposal became reality when Ontario Regulation 227 (O. Reg. 227 / 00 - "Electricity Generation- Monitoring and Reporting") came into effect in May of 2000. <b>This</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>applied</b> to certain Ontario electricity generation facilities and regulated 28 airborne contaminants. The goal of a regulated air emissions inventory program applicable to a wide spectrum facilities was realized when the MOE promulgated Ontario Regulation 127 (O. Reg. 127 / 01) regulating air emissions from industrial, commercial, institutional, and municipal point sources in the province. Facilities are able to report their air emissions under O. Reg. 127 / 01 via the MOE’s web-based reporting and registration site titled “OnAIR”. This study will chronicle the evolution of air emissions inventories in the province of Ontario, describing the progression from voluntary to mandatory point source air emissions reporting, provide observations of the air emissions reports submitted by Ontario point sources, and discuss the future direction of air emissions reporting in the province...|$|R
