At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who attacks Mark.|$|E
5|$|Borat seeks {{advice from}} an {{etiquette}} coach who suggests Borat attend a private dinner at an eating {{club in the}} South. During the dinner, he (unintentionally) insults or otherwise offends <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests.</b> When he lets Luenell, an African-American prostitute, {{into the house and}} shows her to the table, they both get kicked out. Borat befriends Luenell, and she invites him into a relationship with her, but he tells her that he is in love with someone else. Borat then visits an antique shop with a display of Confederate heritage items, and clumsily breaks various items.|$|E
5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not attend for a second day's racing, they asked all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E

5|$|The police {{return in}} force but are {{overwhelmed}} and repelled by the guests. They decide {{to let the}} party end naturally before moving in. T-Rick arrives armed with a flamethrower {{in an attempt to}} reclaim his gnome. He begins setting fire to the trees and cars in search of Costa, forcing the guests to flee and the party to end. The police shoot his flamethrower pack and it explodes. Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> as Thomas' house burns and the SWAT team moves in to retake the neighborhood. The neighborhood is left aflame.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer and some of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> {{who happen to be}} above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests,</b> {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E
5|$|Tom {{is arrested}} {{by the police and}} the guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he would be the one to do it.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{tradition}} {{exists in}} France, where the fève (originally a dried bean, but often now a small china or metal trinket) {{is placed in}} the galette des rois; the person who finds it in their slice becomes the king or queen of the meal, and is often expected to serve <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> to drink.|$|E
50|$|Mixing Styles: One guest {{suggests}} a musical style, and other a singer/band, and styles are combined, e.g. Roll with It by Oasis {{in the style}} of Jerry Lee Lewis. The roles are then reversed, with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest</b> performing.|$|R
50|$|The Ghostown {{recording}} {{sessions in}} London were overseen and produced by Tony Visconti. Visconti also provides piano, synthesizer, organ, mandolin and string arrangements..

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest,</b> {{who sat on}} {{my young}} lady's right hand, was an eminent public character--being no <b>other</b> than <b>the</b> celebrated Indian traveller, Mr. Murthwaite, who, at risk of his life, had {{penetrated}} in disguise where no European had ever set foot before.|$|R
25|$|The evening gatherings at Swieten's {{home had}} a marked effect on Beethoven, {{for it was}} here that he first became acquainted with the music of Handel and Bach. He {{generally}} had to stay long after <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> had departed, for his elderly host was musically insatiable and would not let the young pianist go until he had 'blessed the evening' with several Bach fugues.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} cremation, {{which is a}} mock {{ceremonial}} burning, the king lights the cremation fire and lays the first —artificial flowers made of sandalwood and used ceremonially in cremations. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> then follow suit, laying flowers one by one. The ritual is repeated later in the night, with a smaller group of guests, when the actual cremation takes place. On the first lighting a 21-gun salute and a three-volley salute are fired in the Sanam Luang field.|$|E
25|$|Florence Parbury was {{interested}} in aviation from its early days in England. In 1910 she attended the Blackpool Flying Carnival where she was a passenger in the Henry Farman biplane flown by Claude Grahame-White. She attended his first marriage in June 1912, where almost all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> were eminent {{in the world of}} aviation. Parbury also described how she flew over Stonehenge in a biplane piloted by Howard Pixton, an early British aviator who won the 1914 Schneider Trophy air race held in Monaco.|$|E

25|$|Encolpius and his companions, by now wearied and disgusted, try {{to leave}} as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests</b> proceed to the baths, but are {{prevented}} by a porter (72). They escape only after Trimalchio holds a mock funeral for himself. The vigiles, mistaking the sound of horns for a signal that a fire has broken out, burst into the residence (78). Using this sudden alarm {{as an excuse to}} get rid of the sophist Agamemnon, whose company Encolpius and his friends are weary of, they flee as if from a real fire (78).|$|E
25|$|The artists on the Ships and Dip cruises have sailed {{on board}} {{with the rest of}} the {{passengers}} for the duration of the cruises; this contrasts some music cruises on which the artist or artists travel separately to one of the cruise destinations and perform there, or join the cruise for only a portion of the trip. Band members have enjoyed other artists' shows and the ship's amenities freely with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests.</b> Barenaked Ladies have performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly have sat in with other artists at their shows.|$|E
25|$|On 25 October 2009, Emina Jahović gave a huge {{concert at}} the Sava Centar in New Belgrade, Serbia.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest</b> was so {{thoroughly}} a colonist, and {{had so little}} idea of anything but primitive hospitality, {{that he had had}} no notion of writing beforehand to announce his coming, and accident had delayed the letters by which Norman and Meta had announced their decision of sending home their eldest boy under his care.|$|R
5000|$|On the show, James said, [...] "Well, I don't {{know who}} he was talking about for sure, Chris, but if he wasn't talking about Barack Obama, he should have been talking about Barack Obama, I hope he was talking about Barack Obama." [...] <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest,</b> Air America Radio {{president}} and Democratic politician Mark J. Green, denounced Bush's comparison.|$|R
5000|$|The band's {{debut album}} That's What I Like was {{released}} on 12 September 2008.

25|$|Together {{with many}} other leading figures from the Bolton area, {{including}} those from the Black Horse Club, Hick was a promoter and with Peter Rothwell an original shareholder of the Bolton and Leigh Railway that opened 1 August 1828 with the naming of the locomotive Lancashire Witch by Mrs Hulton, wife of the vilified William Hulton JP, High Sheriff of Lancashire and collier. Robert Stephenson was driver of the engine he designed and built with chief engineer George Stephenson, who was a passenger with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests.</b> Following the occasion that gathered crowds of 40-50 thousand people, in October 1828, Hick and Rothwell received Robert Peel, then home secretary, as a guest at their foundry.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he got up to some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silvio informs Tony that he {{eliminated}} Burt {{after learning}} {{he was a}} double agent for the Lupertazzis. Tony, Silvio and Bobby convene at Nuovo Vesuvio, where Tony breaks the news to them about Phil's plans to kill them and of his decision to preemptively kill Phil first, using the Italian hitmen who performed the hit on Rusty Millio. Meanwhile, {{at a dinner party}} with colleagues, Dr. Melfi hears again of the study claiming sociopaths take advantage of talk therapy, leading to a confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guests.</b> Melfi's psychiatrist, Dr. Kupferberg, indifferently breaks the doctor–patient confidentiality by revealing that Tony is Melfi's patient, embarrassing her. Later at home, she thoroughly reads the study herself and is convinced of its findings.|$|E
60|$|As to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest</b> now {{present in}} Mr. Yorke's parlour, Mr. Helstone, {{between him and}} his host there existed a double {{antipathy}}--the antipathy of nature and that of circumstances. The free-thinker hated the formalist; the lover of liberty detested the disciplinarian. Besides, it was said that in former years they had been rival suitors of the same lady.|$|R
5000|$|After Buck Owens {{left the}} show, a {{different}} country music artist would accompany Roy Clark {{as a guest}} co-host each week, who would give the episode's opening performance, participate with Clark in the [...] "Pickin' and Grinnin'" [...] sketch, and assist Clark in introducing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guest</b> stars' performances. <b>The</b> show's final season (Hee Haw Silver) was hosted by Clark alone.|$|R
