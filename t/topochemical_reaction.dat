40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{energy-efficient}} oil shale pyrolysis process {{triggered by a}} <b>topochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> {{that can be applied}} in horizontal oil shale formations. The process starts by feeding preheated air to oil shale to initiate a <b>topochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> and the onset of self-pyrolysis. As the temperature in the virgin oil shale increases (to 250 – 300 °C), the hot air can be replaced by ambient-temperature air, allowing heat to be released by internal topochemical reactions to complete the pyrolysis. The propagation of fronts formed in this process, the temperature evolution, and the reaction mechanism of oil shale pyrolysis in porous media are discussed and compared with those in a traditional oxygen-free process. The results show that the self-pyrolysis of oil shale can be achieved with the proposed method without any need for external heat. The results also verify that fractured oil shale may be more suitable for underground retorting. Moreover, the gas and liquid products from this method were characterised, and a highly instrumented experimental device designed specifically for this process is described.

In streptavidin-peptide cocrystals of space group 1222, cyclic peptide monomers are bound on adjacent streptavidin tetramers related by a crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis. We {{set out to}} determine whether the disulfide bonds of the peptide, presented close to one another in the crystal, could undergo disulfide interchange to form a dimer. Results: When juxtaposed, the disulfides of neighboring peptides undergo disulfide interchange, breaking and forming covalent disulfide bonds, to produce a peptide dimer adopting the symmetry of the crystal. This is the first example of a chemical transformation mediated by a protein crystal lattice. The structure of the streptavidin-bound monomer, and that of the dimer that was eventually produced from it in the crystal, were both determined from the same single crystal studied at different times. The two-fold symmetric peptide dimer was independently synthesized and shown to form crystals of dimerized streptavidin. Conclusions: We have shown that formation of a covalently linked peptide dimer can be mediated by a protein crystal lattice. The dimer thus produced dimerizes its target, streptavidin, suggesting that solid-state (or <b>topochemical)</b> <b>reactions</b> of this kind may be broadly useful for the preparation of ligands that can dimerize other protein targets...|$|R

Two distinct γ-type structures of 3 -ClCA/ 3 -BrCA solid solutions and two distinct β-type structures of 3 -ClCA/ 3 -BrCA solid solutions are reported and structurally characterized. One of the γ-type structures is isostructural with the known γ polymorphs of pure 3 -ClCA and pure 3 -BrCA, whereas the other γ-type structure has not been observed previously for either pure 3 -ClCA or pure 3 -BrCA (representing a rare case in which the structure of the solid solution is not known for the pure phases of either of the constituent molecules). One of the β-type structures of the 3 -ClCA/ 3 -BrCA solid solutions is similar to the β polymorph of pure 3 -ClCA, whereas the other β-type structure is similar to the β polymorph of pure 3 -BrCA.

Using two {{different kinds of}} reactive templates with core−shell structure obtained using colloidal chemistry methods, we fabricated {{for the first time}} Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 nanorods and nanotubes by means of solid-state reactions. The intimate contact of the parent compounds in the core−shell template resulted in low reaction temperatures (500 − 600 °C), overcoming the morphological instability problem of one-dimensional (1 D) templates. As the formation of bismuth titanate is dominated by the coupled ambipolar diffusion of Bi 3 + and O 2 − ions through the titanate layer, the final morphology, nanorod or nanotube, is determined by the relative arrangement of the parent compounds in the core−shell template. When the bismuth precursor is located in the shell region and the core is a single-crystal TiO 2 nanowire, formation of a single-crystal Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 nanorod occurs by a <b>topochemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> Opposite, when the shell corresponds to nanocrystalline TiO 2 and the core to the bismuth precursor, the reaction leads to a porous nanorod or a nanotube depending on the template thickness.

This replenishing process of empty sites, coupled with the dissolution of tetrahedral sites is likely to be observed for the first time due to the presence of well separated, polymer intercalated platelets. TEM pictures vision crystal growth arising from the zone of the LSH edge-slab and by using solid state kinetics formalism the associated high activation energy of the first-order reaction agrees well with a plausible dissolution re-precipitation mechanism. The conversion of LSH into LDH platelets may be extended to others cations as Co 2 +, Cu 2 +, as well as the aluminum source (AlCl 3) and the water-soluble polymer (NVP), thus indicating it is a new prevalent facet of LDH...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of complex metal-oxide phases is typically performed at high temperature {{to overcome the}} considerable energetic barriers to solid-solid diffusion. However, these ceramic synthesis strategies often struggle to prepare homogeneous samples free from impurity phases, and in general cannot be utilized to prepare metastable phases. By applying low-temperature 'soft chemistry' via the use of precursor phases or solvothermal and flux synthesis routes, more homogeneous samples can be prepared. In addition by utilizing the high mobility of particular chemical species within extended metal-oxide lattices, low-temperature <b>topochemical</b> (structure-conserving) <b>reactions</b> can be performed to yield metastable product phases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A new soft-chemical {{transformation}} of layered perovskite oxides is described wherein K 2 O is sequentially {{extracted from the}} Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phase, K 2 La 2 Ti 3 O 10 (I), yielding novel anion-deficient KLa 2 Ti 3 O 9. 5 (II) and La 2 Ti 3 O 9 (III). The transformation occurs in <b>topochemical</b> <b>reactions</b> of the R-P phase I with PPh 4 Br and PBu 4 Br (Ph = phenyl; Bu = n-butyl). The mechanism involves the elimination of KBr accompanied by decomposition of PR 4 + (R = phenyl or n-butyl) that extracts oxygen from the titanate. Analysis of the organic products of decomposition reveals formation of Ph 3 PO, Ph 3 P, and Ph-Ph for R = phenyl, and Bu 3 PO, Bu 3 P along with butane, butene, and octane for R = butyl. The inorganic oxides II and III crystallize in tetragonal structures (II: P 4 /mmm, a = 3. 8335 (1) angstrom, c = 14. 334 (1) angstrom; III: / 4 / mmm, a = 3. 8565 (2) angstrom, c = 24. 645 (2) angstrom) {{that are related to}} the parent R-P phase. II is isotypic with the Dion-Jacobson phase, RbSr 2 Nb 3 O 10, while III is a unique layered oxide consisting of charge-neutral La 2 Ti 3 O 9 anion-deficient perovskite sheets stacked one over the other without interlayer cations. Interestingly, both II and III convert back to the parent R-P phase in a reaction with KNO 3. While transformations of the R-P phases to other related layered/three-dimensional perovskite oxides in ion-exchange/metathesis/dehydration/reduction reactions are known, the simultaneous and reversible extraction of both cations and anions in the conversions K 2 La 2 Ti 3 O 10 reversible arrow KLa 2 Ti 3 O 9. 5 reversible arrow La 2 Ti 3 O 9 is reported here for the first time...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three parts. The first part concerns {{the investigation of the}} topochemical reduction of LaSrNiRuO 6 in order to prepare LaSrNiRuO 4 via anion deintercalation. The second part discusses the oxide-for-hydride anion exchanges performed in SrV 1 -x Ti x O 3, and the resulting SrV 1 -x Ti x O 2 -y H 1 +y reduction products. Finally, the results from redox-neutral <b>topochemical</b> cation exchange <b>reactions</b> conducted in the three-dimensional perovskite structure of NaTaO 3 are presented along with the characterisation of a novel product of composition Ni 0. 5 TaO 3. The topochemical reduction of LaSrNiRuO 6 using CaH 2 was carried out to produce a novel extended oxide phase with composition LaSrNiRuO 4. This phase is composed of sheets of apex-linked Ni 1 + O 4 and Ru 2 + O 4 squares in a checkerboard ordered arrangement. To the best of our knowledge, this material is the first example of a B-cation ordered infinite-layer oxide phase. The low oxidation states of the transition-metal cations are confirmed by DFT calculations from which a spin moment S = &frac 12; is determined for the nickel while the ruthenium centres adopt an intermediate-spin S = 1 configuration. LaSrNiRuO 4 behaves paramagnetically at room temperature. However, upon cooling (T < 250 K) a phase transition is observed in which the nickel spins interact ferromagnetically, while the ruthenium cations appear to undergo a change in spin configuration to a diamagnetic spin state. A possible explanation is given for this observation based on an ordered arrangement of local Jahn-Teller distortions. While investigating the preparation of LaSrNiRuO 4, it was observed that different samples of the LaSrNiRuO 6 starting materials exhibited markedly different reactivity. The observed differing reactivity is inconsistent with the crystal structure and composition of the LaSrNiRuO 6 samples, from which all the materials are identical. Careful investigation of the X-ray diffraction data collected from the LaSrNiRuO 6 materials revealed that the reactivity of the samples is a consequence of the microstructure. By quenching or slow-cooling the materials during their synthesis, the size of the crystalline domains formed is affected and this in turn is observed to define {{the extent to which the}} topochemical deintercalation of oxide anions takes place. A mechanism to explain this effect is presented in which the greater 'plasticity' of small crystalline domains helps to limit the influence of lattice strain during the reaction. Similar with the observations for the LaSrNiRuO 6 phases, it was found that the reactivity of SrV 0. 95 Ti 0. 05 O 3 samples towards topochemical oxide-for-hydride exchange is also determined by the characteristics of the starting materials. The cooling rate can lead to phase segregation in SrV 0. 95 Ti 0. 05 O 3 samples which in turn affects the reduction behaviour. A modification of the energy profile for the oxide-for-hydride exchange in SrV 1 -x Ti x O 3 phases is proposed on the basis of the electronic configuration that the transition-metal cations adopt upon reduction (d 2,V 3 + and d 1,Ti 3 +). Finally, <b>topochemical</b> exchange <b>reactions</b> can also be carried out between cations in complex transition metal oxides when the mobility of the species to be exchanged is sufficiently greater with respect to the host lattice. The preparation of Ni 0. 5 TaO 3 from exchange of Na + by Ni 2 + in NaTaO 3 represents a synthetic approach not yet widely explored in the long-standing challenge that the preparation of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials represents. The <b>topochemical</b> <b>reactions</b> studied in this work highlight the possibility of directing and modifying the product phases, by tuning features of the reagents. This is in contrast with the limited control available in thermodynamic processes. </p...|$|R
