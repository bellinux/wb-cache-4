[...] She added {{that she was}} [...] "so grateful" [...] for the storyline and {{described}} her departure episode as [...] "complex, moving, wretched". She described Babe as [...] "vengeful", [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "a bit of a witch". Badland {{expressed an interest in}} reprising the role and said a potential return had been allowed for, before adding that she believes Babe will return. Badland said she would continue to watch the show as her on-screen family [...] "are all part of [...] now" [...] and she [...] "will always be their auntie." [...] She described the Carter family as the highlight during her time on the show. She added, [...] "We all came together and formed this brilliant family which is pretty astounding – we are all very different but that bond <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> all together was extraordinary." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E

500|$|The deal ended a {{diplomatic}} deadlock <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>US</b> {{relations with the}} nuclear-armed South Asian nation to a near standstill and hindered counter-terrorism operations against Pakistan-based militants. Because of the supply lines closure the United States has spent at least an additional $100 million a month because it was instead forced to move supplies by air, rail or truck through Russia and other countries north of Afghanistan at much longer and more expensive routes. The closure of the supply lines complicated the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, cost the United States more than $1 billion in extra shipping fees {{as a result of}} having to use the alternative routes through Central Asia and also held up delivery of thousands of armoured vehicles and other equipment meant for the fledgling Afghan army and police, slowing US efforts to build Afghan forces that can stand up to the Taliban insurgency as foreign troops withdraw. The reopening of the supply lines means that the US will save {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in the run-up to the withdrawal of NATO forces from the Afghanistan and also that it would help the US and NATO to complete its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan [...] "at a much lower cost" [...] according to Clinton. Despite the reopening of critical supply routes from Pakistan, the US military confronts a giant logistical challenge to wind down the war in Afghanistan because it must withdraw till the end of 2014 nearly 90,000 troops and enormous depots of military equipment accumulated over a decade of war which includes 100,000 shipping containers stuffed with materiel and 50,000 wheeled vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{retreated to}} a [...] "less synth and more guitar based" [...] sound than their {{previous}} album, reminiscent of, and effectively reverting to, their debut album, Conditions.

He also stated that the album's lengthy production had aided in the writing and recording of the songs, saying that the band [...] "had the time and space to develop tracks in a way which allowed them to take on a new life during the process." [...] Lead vocalist Dougy Mandagi additionally described the tracks on the album as [...] "more upbeat, up-tempo songs compared to the last record [...] faster songs with a few sombre moments here and there." [...] Additionally, Thick as Thieves is also the first time the band had invited songwriting personnel outside of the band to work on the album, which included producer Pascal Gabriel, who co-wrote most of the songs with the band, and Justin Parker, who co-wrote [...] "Fall Together" [...] with Mandagi.
