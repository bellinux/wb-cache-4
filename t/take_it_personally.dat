5|$|Don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>personally</b> is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game {{where the majority}} of the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

500|$|After Digital, Love {{worked on}} her first {{commercial}} game project, Love and Order, a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso. She did writing and design work for the game, set in the Crown attorney's office in Montreal, which was released in February 2011. Love describes the game as [...] "not really my best work", as dating simulations are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while, and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full-time profession. In 2011, she spent the month of March working on another visual novel: Don't <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>Personally,</b> Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story, which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011.

500|$|Don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>personally</b> was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} a month, and was released as a free download on April 4, 2011. It was written and developed by Christine Love, with artwork made for the game by Auro-Cyanide, artwork licensed from Tokudaya and Kimagure After, and with music licensed from Rengoku Teien and propanmode. It was created using the Ren'Py engine. It was Love's longest game to date, and her first attempt at a game with a branching storyline. It was intended as [...] "a spiritual sequel of sorts" [...] to , a 2010 game by Love. The game was made for NaNoRenO (National Ren'ai Game Writing Month), a month-long contest in the vein of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month.

500|$|Don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>personally</b> {{was chosen}} as a [...] "freeware game pick" [...] by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who {{said that it was}} worth playing through {{multiple}} times in order to see the different paths the story takes depending on the player's choices. The Daily Telegraph gave the visual novel the award for [...] "Best Script" [...] in its video game awards of 2011, stating that [...] "Love's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student's worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn't dare." [...] Pete Davidson of GamePro noted the game {{as an example of the}} [...] "creativity" [...] missing in many large-budget titles, and praised the story, calling Love [...] "a writer first and a game developer second." [...] Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as [...] "a game about love, sex and the internet" [...] that was [...] "capable of being profoundly moving" [...] and was about [...] "what it is to feel like someone's kicked me straight in the heart". He praised Love's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the [...] "12chan" [...] threads as a Greek chorus was [...] "perhaps a meta-layer too far".|$|E
500|$|That summer, Love {{began working}} on a larger, {{commercial}} game. She was beginning to believe that her games could be successful commercially, a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works. The game, , was released in February 2012. Love dropped out of university during the game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She {{felt that she was}} [...] "not really learning a whole lot" [...] and was unable to balance school and work on the game. Set centuries after Digital: A Love Story, the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after [...] "going dark". The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on [...] "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay." [...] The release of Analogue, Love's first commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially. Although Analogue is a sequel [...] "of sorts" [...] to Digital, the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between Digital and Don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>personally.</b> Analogue sold over 30,000 copies by August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a commercial expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus, which is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and the ship. In 2016, Love released a new visual novel, Ladykiller in a Bind. She described the game as [...] "an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls".|$|E

[...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
