40|$|Child {{sex tourism}} {{is a growing}} problem and a {{relatively}} new challenge for the Dutch national police, which is faced {{with the task of}} combatting child sexual abuse by Dutch citizens abroad. Little is known about <b>travelling</b> child <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> In this literature review, information from (international) scientific research, Dutch policy reports, and other documents is analyzed to investigate the characteristics, motives and techniques (modus operandi) of (Dutch) child sex tourists. We conclude that this offender group is not homogeneous, and that different motivations (preferential/situational) and modus operandi (short stay/long stay/online) apply. The diversity of the offender group requires a variety of initiatives which are well-adjusted to the different offender types. The scarcity of research on this topic furthermore illustrates the necessity to gather more intelligence and conduct follow-up research...|$|R

50|$|A {{study by}} professors from Columbia University and the University of Michigan found that having police-only <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> {{registries}} (e.g., Britain, Canada, Australia) significantly reduces <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> recidivism, but making information about <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> publicly available significantly increases recidivism rates. This is because making <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> information public increases offender stress and {{also makes the}} thought of returning to prison less threatening, as some <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> may feel returning to prison is not significantly worse than being on the public registry. Some <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> may come to view their central identity as being that of a <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> due to the registry, and the more a <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> views themselves as being a criminal {{the more likely they}} are to reoffend. However, the study also found that making <b>sex</b> <b>offender</b> registration publicly available may deter some potential first time <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> from committing an offense that would get them on the registry in the first place.

40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>offender</b> {{registration}} and community notification requirements are universally ap-plied to all <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> irrespective of their type.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} predictors {{of attitudes toward}} <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> focusing on Belief in a Just World (BJW) and religiosity as variables that {{were likely to be}} related to attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> based on previous research. Predictors of attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> may facilitate better understanding of recidivism rates among <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and may aid professionals who work with <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> such as probation and parole officers. Hypotheses were that Religiosity would be negatively correlated with attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and BJW would be positively correlated with attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Responses from 252 participants were collected using a Qualtrics survey. The order of the surveys was randomized. There was no significant correlation between Religiosity and attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> BJW and attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> were significantly positively correlated, possibly because attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> differ between survey conditions. It is possible that attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are influenced by the measurement in the same study of attitudes toward other groups, such as victims of sex offenses. These findings could have significant implications for future research done within the Belief in a Just World theory, as the current study suggests data on attitudes should be controlled for the known presence of other groups in study designs.

40|$|Topics {{related to}} sexual {{offending}} and <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> can provoke {{a great deal}} of fear and anxiety in society. <b>Sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are {{a group of people who}} are considered to be especially unpleasant and harmful compared to other types of offenders. Over the past two decades, academic researchers and clinical professionals have developed a variety of assessment methods and treatment programmes to reduce recidivism rates of <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Public attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are proposed to play an important role in the effectiveness of treatment for <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Thus, general community members’ attitudes have been widely studied in western countries.

The study yielded results which indicate that the Pe subscale was not effective in discriminating pedophiles from non-pedophile <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> or from the control group. The results also indicated that the Ic subscale was not effective in discriminating incest perpetrators from non-incest <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> or the control group.
