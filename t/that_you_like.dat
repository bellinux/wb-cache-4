25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
500|$|I am {{very much}} pleased <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that coin. [...] I shall {{have all kinds}} of trouble over it, but I do feel what you say is true: [...] that is, that it is the best coin that has been struck for two {{thousand}} years, and that no matter what is its temporary fate, it will {{serve as a model for}} future coin makers, and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is based on the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Directed by Ben Coughlan, Del Rey filmed {{a second}} video for the song, titled [...] "Video Games (Live At The Premises)". Uploaded to her {{official}} VEVO account on October 18, 2011, the song features Del Rey in jean {{shorts and a}} white T-shirt, singing into a microphone barefoot, while accompanied by a pianist. The Huffington Post wrote that the video was [...] "loaded", indicating that the title was a contradiction and not, in fact, a live performance whatsoever. Additionally, they wrote: [...] "we understand the takedowns of her hype (there {{is a lot of}} hype), but that doesn't change the fact that [...] "Video Games"—the tune Lana's singing live this time—is one helluva song." [...] Aside from criticizing her pillowy lips and long fingernails, The Guardian applauded Del Rey for amping up on the coquettish glances and hushed vocals as she devastatingly delivers the line, [...] "I heard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the bad girls, honey, is that true?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the show's broadcast, it {{was stated}} that the set for the show, {{designed}} by the same designer of Conan's previous sets, John Shaffner, would be inspired by The Legally Prohibited Tour, adopting more of a [...] "theatre" [...] appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on {{the choice of the}} show's chair, stating, [...] "You find one <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> and then you build it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer [...] But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they’ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'" [...] The rest of the set has been described as being [...] "filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens," [...] and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on The Tonight Show. The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean. [...] In keeping with a change made during The Tonight Show, Andy Richter joins O'Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set rather than remaining behind a lectern after the monologue.|$|E
