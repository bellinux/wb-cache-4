5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> between {{wheel and axle}} (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across <b>the</b> <b>interface.</b> In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across <b>the</b> <b>interface,</b> a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E

40|$|Diffusion in an {{evolving}} environment is studied by continuos-time Monte Carlo simulations. Diffusion is modelled by continuos-time random walkers on a lattice, in a dynamic environment provided by bubbles between two one-dimensional interfaces driven symmetrically towards each other. For one-dimensional random walkers constrained by <b>the</b> <b>interfaces,</b> <b>the</b> bubble size distribution domi- nates diffusion. For two-dimensional random walkers, {{it is also}} controlled by the topography and dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>interfaces.</b> <b>The</b> results of the one-dimensional case are recovered in the limit where <b>the</b> <b>interfaces</b> are strongly driven.
