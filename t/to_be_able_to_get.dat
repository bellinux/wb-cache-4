25|$|A Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. The nearest Axis bases were on Rhodes, and so the aircraft had to stage through somewhere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Iraq. The only possible place was Vichy-controlled Syria. This overtly hostile action could not be tolerated. Consequently, after victory in Iraq, British forces invaded Syria and Lebanon to remove the Vichy officials from power there. Vigorous resistance was put up by the French against British and Australian forces moving into Lebanon from Palestine. However, pressure there eventually overwhelmed, and when this combined with an advance on Damascus from Iraq, the French surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{production}} model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50in (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns {{mounted in the}} fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two 165US Gallon (1,204 litre) drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by 1,000lb (454kg) bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, {{this was due to}} the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{in and out of the}} aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.|$|E
