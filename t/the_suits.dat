5|$|Darby {{eventually}} brought {{suit for}} libel against Kendall and Eliza Sharp, {{as well as}} Senator Beauchamp and Sharp's brother Leander. Numerous delays and changes of venue prevented any of <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> from ever going to trial. Darby died in December 1829.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004 the South Carolina Supreme Court {{dismissed}} <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> against Thompson and Meyer, but {{allowed the}} suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. The court stated that South Carolina's long-arm jurisdiction {{did not apply}} to Thompson and Meyer, but did to W. W. Norton.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, the California {{lawsuit was}} dropped {{in order to}} merge with the Minnesota lawsuit. Boies hoped that the move would {{speed up the process}} since the courts will likely merge <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> as they are similar {{complaints}} seeking the same outcome.|$|E
50|$|Recently, Michael Anton, {{author of}} <b>The</b> <b>Suit,</b> has {{advocated}} {{for the return}} of <b>the</b> drape <b>suit.</b> <b>The</b> American Zoot <b>suit</b> is an extreme exaggeration of <b>the</b> sack <b>suit.</b> Although <b>the</b> drape <b>suit</b> and <b>the</b> sack <b>suit</b> are similar, they are not the same cut and style.|$|R
50|$|Technologies {{evaluated}} with <b>the</b> second generation <b>suit</b> include electronic textiles {{for use as}} buttons incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>suit,</b> a heads-up display, GPS capability, and speech recognition software to allow <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> occupant to receive information from <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> and external hardware.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>the</b> old <b>suit</b> {{names were}} {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> new <b>suits</b> - {{this is the reason}} why Portuguese names for <b>suits</b> don't match <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> drawings. In Portuguese, <b>the</b> Hearts <b>suit</b> is called Copas ("cups"), <b>the</b> Spades <b>suit</b> is called Espadas ("swords"), <b>the</b> Diamonds <b>suit</b> is called Ouros ("gold coins"), and <b>the</b> Clubs <b>suit</b> is called Paus ("clubs" [...] or [...] "sticks").|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob {{has been}} up to. Edna {{activates}} a beacon she built into <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome shoots down Helen's plane, but she and the children survive and reach the island. When Bob is informed that his family is dead, he grabs and threatens to kill Mirage, but relents when Syndrome calls his bluff.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{involved}} {{more than}} 1300 {{individuals who had}} won several separate judgments against Iran for its supportive role in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, several other bombings, an assassination, and a kidnapping. After winning judgments by default, based on a clear evidentiary basis for Iran's liability, they sought writs of execution against a Citibank account in New York connected with Iran's central bank. <b>The</b> <b>suits</b> for execution against the Citibank account were consolidated into one case through various procedural mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. <b>The</b> <b>suits</b> themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Suit</b> of Cups or Suit of Goblets {{is one of}} <b>the</b> four <b>suits</b> of Latin-suited playing cards. These {{are used}} in Spain ("Copas"), Italy ("Coppe") and in tarot. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> of hearts is derived from <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> of cups. These are {{sometimes}} referred to as chalices as well as cups.|$|R

5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. <b>The</b> <b>suits</b> were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suit</b> was {{designed}} to be worn over a liquid cooling garment. The inner fabric of <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> was gray nylon canvas. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> was insulated with waffle-textured foil. The outer layer was an off-white satin-weave fabric with orange trim.|$|R
25|$|Attachment rings allow {{separate}} neck seals, gloves, and (less commonly) {{boots to}} be joined to <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> with a watertight seal. The older style attachment ring system uses a support ring inside <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> and a clamping band outside <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> to tightly hold <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> and <b>the</b> separate hood/boot/glove together. They were also used with the neck seals of some old British frogman-type dry suits.|$|R

5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue <b>the</b> <b>suits.</b> The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

40|$|A {{device is}} {{reported}} for regulating the pneumatic pressure in a ventilated space <b>suit</b> relative to <b>the</b> pressure imposed on <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> when being worn {{by a person}} underwater to simulate space environment for testing and experimentation. A box unit located on the chest area of <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> comprises connections for suit air supply and return lines and carries a regulator valve that stabilizes the air pressure differential between the {{inside and outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>suit.</b> <b>The</b> valve and <b>suit</b> pressure is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> occupant and <b>the</b> valve includes a mechanism for quickly dumping <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> pressure in case of emergency. Pressure monitoring and relief devices are also included in the box unit...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the wide}} variety of patterns, <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> show a {{uniformity}} of structure. Every suit contains twelve cards with the top two usually being the court cards of king and vizier and the bottom ten being pip cards. Half <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> use reverse ranking for their pip cards. There are many motifs for the suit pips but some include coins, clubs, jugs, and swords which resemble later Mamluk and Latin suits. Michael Dummett speculated that Mamluk cards may have descended from an earlier deck which consisted of 48 cards divided into four suits each with ten pip cards and two court cards.|$|E
25|$|Shareholders filed {{class action}} {{lawsuits}} against Netbank and its executives claiming misrepresentation {{of the company}} before it was shutdown by regulators. <b>The</b> <b>suits</b> were settled in November 2011 for $12.5 million.|$|E
25|$|They pointed, in particular, to Section 5 of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955, {{which they}} claimed implied 'reciprocity'. This was contested by others and {{eventually}} <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> were dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Suit</b> of Coins {{is one of}} <b>the</b> four <b>suits</b> used in Latin suited playing cards, such as Spanish, Italian and tarot decks. It {{corresponds}} to <b>the</b> <b>Suit</b> of Diamonds in standard decks.|$|R
