25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.|$|E

Mercedes informed Tony about the pregnancy, despite their dislike for each other, {{because she felt}} he had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> According to Metcalfe, Mercedes considered giving her baby to her sister, since Jacqui was unable to have children but {{wanted to become a}} mother, but did not tell Jacqui the baby's paternity. Metcalfe also felt that Mercedes decided against giving Jacqui the baby because Mercedes was unable to [...] "cope" [...] with the baby's paternity, and would be more willing to give Jacqui the baby if Tony was not the father. When asked if Mercedes would keep the baby herself, Metcalfe said, [...] "She would if it was Russ' or maybe even the product of a one-night stand. But Tony's baby and all the baggage that comes with that? No thanks!" [...] Mercedes decided to terminate the pregnancy. When asked how she thought Jacqui would react if she found out that Tony was the father, Metcalfe said Jacqui would [...] "go a bit psycho". She also said that it would take a long time for Jacqui to forgive Mercedes if she discovered the truth.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2016, {{the company}} sued the U.S. government, arguing that secrecy orders were {{preventing}} {{the company from}} disclosing warrants to customers {{in violation of the}} company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit {{as a result of a}} policy change by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had “changed data request rules on alerting internet users about agencies accessing their information.” [...] The new policy mandated defined periods of time for secrecy orders from the government.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the right}} to the {{communication}} of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether {{it is appropriate to}} reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it. [...] The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. The sacrament of confession is inviolable.|$|E

2500|$|On January 7, 2009, {{supporters}} of Proposition 8 filed a federal lawsuit to block public disclosure of their donations. Alleging threats against {{their lives as}} well as other forms of harassment, the lawsuit also requested a preliminary injunction that ordered the California Secretary of State to remove information about donations posted on its website. Opponents of Proposition 8 called it [...] "hypocritical" [...] that its supporters would refer to their support of the measure as the [...] "will of the people" [...] while seeking to overturn voter-approved campaign disclosure laws. U.S. District Judge Morrison England, Jr. denied that request on January 29; he said that the public had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about donors of political causes, that he did not agree that the plaintiffs had a probability of success in court, and that they had not proven they would suffer [...] "irreparable injury" [...] if he did not grant the preliminary injunction.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National Organization for Marriage, argue that children do best when {{raised by a}} mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to {{the best interests of}} children. [...] David Blankenhorn cites the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says that a child has [...] "the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents," [...] in support of this argument (before he reversed position on the issue). [...] Some same-sex marriage opponents argue that having and raising children is the underlying purpose of marriage. The opponents {{of same-sex}} marriage assume that same-sex unions implicitly lack the everyday ability of opposite-sex couples to produce and raise offspring by natural means. They also argue that children raised by same-sex partners are disadvantaged in various ways and that same-sex unions thus cannot be recognized within the scope of [...] "marriage." [...] The argument that a child has <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and be cared for by his or her parents leaves a number of issues open to debate involving same-sex marriage, including infertile heterosexual couples or couples not wishing for children, as well as same-sex unions where a family exists with children from previous relationships, [...] adoption, artificial insemination, surrogacy, or co-parenting. Social consequences are also heavily debated, such as whether marriage should be defined in terms of procreation.|$|E
