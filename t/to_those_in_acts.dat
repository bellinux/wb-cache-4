The {{current study was}} designed to pilot test a brief, widely inclusive, local access format of <b>ACT</b> <b>in</b> a UK primary care setting. Seventy-three participants (68. 5 % women) were randomized to either ACT or treatment as usual (TAU). Many of the participants were aged 65 years or older (27. 6 %), were diagnosed with fibromyalgia (30. 2 %) and depression (40. 3 %), and had longstanding pain (median = 10  years). Standard clinical outcome measures included disability, depression, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and rated improvement. Process measures included pain-related and general psychological acceptance. The recruitment target was met within 6 months, and 72. 9 % of <b>those</b> allocated <b>to</b> ACT completed treatment. Immediately post treatment, relative to TAU, participants <b>in</b> <b>ACT</b> demonstrated lower depression and higher ratings of overall improvement. At a 3 -month follow-up, again relative <b>to</b> TAU, <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>ACT</b> demonstrated lower disability, less depression, and significantly higher pain acceptance; d = . 58,. 59, and. 64, respectively.

The narratives of Pentecostals�� preaching and testimony are based upon Biblical tales but they are also accompanied by the same signs and wonders the Bible testifies to.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we argue {{there is a}} need for a formalised {{description}} of musical interaction, which allows reasoning about the musical decisions of human and computational players. To this end, we define a simple model of musical transmission which is amenable to distribution among several musical agents. On top of this, we construct a model of musical perception, based on analysis functions from the musical surface to values on lattices. These values are then used to construct a musical context, allowing for a music-oriented version of concepts such as common ground. This context allows for the interpretation of individual musical output as a stream of discrete actions, with the possibility of constructing sets of performative actions, analogous <b>to</b> <b>those</b> used <b>in</b> Speech <b>Act</b> Theory. This allows musical agent systems to construct output in terms of a communicative dialogue, and should enable more responsive, intelligent participation from these virtual musicians. Finally, we discuss a prototype system which implements these concepts in order to perform piano duets with human performers, and discuss how this theory can be seen as a better defined extension of previous theories...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the passage}} of the Revenue Act of 1964, and while the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was being debated in the Senate, Johnson looked to further bolster his {{legislative}} record in advance of the 1964 election. While the previous two bills had been priorities of Kennedy, Johnson chose to next focus on the War on Poverty based on the advice of economist Walter Heller. In April 1964, Johnson proposed the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which would create the Office of Economic Opportunity to oversee local Community Action Agencies charged with dispensing aid <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> poverty. The <b>act</b> would also create the Job Corps, a work-training program, and AmeriCorps VISTA, a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Johnson was able to win the support of enough conservative Democrats to pass the bill, which he signed on August 20. Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John and Robert Kennedy, became the first head of the Office of Economic Opportunity. He also called upon Congress to make permanent the food stamp pilot programs initiated by President Kennedy in 1961. After much trading of political favors, Congress approved the Food Stamp Act of 1964, which appropriated $75 million to 350,000 individuals in 40 counties and three cities. The president hailed food stamps as [...] "a realistic and responsible step toward the fuller and wiser use of an agricultural abundance." ...|$|R

Participants began the study’s treatment on October 26, 2015, and the study ended on December 12, 2015, when all participants of the study took the regularly nationally scheduled ACT examination. The study’s treatment was comprised of a series of worksheets of mathematical problems constructed similarly <b>to</b> <b>those</b> found <b>in</b> the <b>ACT</b> study guide published by ACT, Inc., and a set of 6 metacognitive relevant questions that were required to be answered after participants of the experimental group completed each worksheet.

The control group did not receive the study’s treatment.

40|$|English honors thesisThe {{essence of}} the {{masquerade}} ball is one of secrecy and fantasy. As a uniquely 18 th century phenomenon, the masquerade was an environment where one can transform into anything imaginable. One of the most prolific female authors during this period, Eliza Fowler Haywood, sought to capture the luxury and imagination of the masquerade within her novels published from 1724 to 1725 : The Masqueraders and Fantomina. For Haywood’s female protagonists, {{the setting of the}} masquerade ball, along with its associated elements such as masks and disguises, grants them sexual power in addition {{to the power of the}} gaze, a privilege previously held by men. As Karin Kukkonen notes in her essay, “The Minds Behind the Mask: Reading for Character in the Masquerade” the “masquerade is a place where Eliza Haywood’s heroines don masks in an endeavor to satisfy their (sexual) curiosity and, at the same time, to escape social censure” (163). In this essay, I will explore how the masquerade promoted this sort of sexual freedom within the 1700 s, and I will analyze how the female protagonists within both of the aforementioned novellas interpret the theme of masquerade as sexual license. Furthermore, I will examine how the tragic and paradoxical endings operate within the narratives – as a moral warning <b>to</b> <b>those</b> participating <b>in</b> licentious <b>acts,</b> a means against the male-dominated romance genre and empowers the female voices in the works, or a realistic outcome based on the patriarchal structures reigning in 18 th century society...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} eight {{neutralizing}} monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for structural proteins of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to protect mice passively against MCMV infection was examined to determine firstly whether a correlation {{existed between the}} neutralization titres of the MAbs in vitro and the protection afforded by the MAbs in vivo and, secondly, {{the contribution of the}} host towards neutralization by the MAbs in vivo. The reduction in MCMV titre in the livers of BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 10 mice by the MAbs closely correlated with their neutralization titres in vitro. However, in the spleens of BALB/c mice, in which MCMV replicates to high titre, almost all of the MAbs tested were ineffective in reducing MCMV replication. Indeed, a significant increase in splenic MCMV replication was observed in mice treated 24 h prior to MCMV replication with either neutralizing MAbs or polyclonal Ig. Each of six MAbs prophylacti-cally protected between 66 and 100 % of mice from an intraperitoneal challenge with 4 LDs 0 MCMV regardless of their neutralization titre in vitro. The persistence of MCMV replication in the salivary gland was not prevented by either polyelonal Ig or MAbs. Despite the absolute requirement for complement for the neutralization of MCMV in vitro, both polyclonal lg and MAb 4 F 9 protected A/J mice, which are deficient in the fifth component of complement, as efficiently as they did complement competent BALB/c mice. These results demonstrate that MAbs specific for single MCMV polypeptides are protective in vivo. In addition, {{the extent to which the}} MAbs protected against MCMV could not be predicted from their immunoreactive or neutralizing titres in vitro or by their effect on splenic MCMV replication in vivo. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the mechanism(s) of neutralization of MCMV in vitro are different <b>to</b> <b>those</b> which <b>act</b> <b>in</b> vivo...|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{argument}} is specious, and I once thought it conclusive. It {{now appears to}} me fallacious. All who are fit to influence electors are not, for that reason, fit to be themselves electors. This last is a much greater power than the former, and those may be ripe for the minor political function who could not as yet be safely trusted with the superior. The opinions and wishes of the poorest and rudest class of laborers may be very useful as one influence among others {{on the minds of}} the voters, as well as on those of the Legislature, and yet it might be highly mischievous to give them the preponderant influence, by admitting them, in their present state of morals and intelligence, to the full exercise of the suffrage. It is precisely this indirect influence of those who have not the suffrage over those who have, which, by its progressive growth, softens the transition to every fresh extension of the franchise, and is the means by which, when the time is ripe, the extension is peacefully brought about. But there is another and a still deeper consideration, which should never be left out of the account in political speculations. The notion is itself unfounded that publicity, and the sense of being answerable to the public, are of no use unless the public are qualified to form a sound judgment. It is a very superficial view of the utility of public opinion to suppose that it does good only when it succeeds in enforcing a servile conformity to itself. To be under the eyes of others--to have to defend oneself to others--is never more important than <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who <b>act</b> <b>in</b> opposition <b>to</b> the opinion of others, for it obliges them to have sure ground of their own. Nothing has so steadying an influence as working against pressure. Unless when under the temporary sway of passionate excitement, no one will do that which he expects to be greatly blamed for, unless from a preconceived and fixed purpose of his own, which is always evidence of a thoughtful and deliberate character, and, except in radically bad men, generally proceeds from sincere and strong personal convictions. Even the bare fact of having to give an account of their conduct is a powerful inducement to adhere to conduct of which at least some decent account can be given. If any one thinks that the mere obligation of preserving decency is not a very considerable check on the abuse of power, he has never had his attention called to the conduct of those who do not feel under the necessity of observing that restraint. Publicity is inappreciable, even when it does no more than prevent that which can by no possibility be plausibly defended--than compel deliberation, and force every one to determine, before he acts, what he shall say if called to account for his actions.|$|R
