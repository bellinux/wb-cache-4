40|$|Sweet" smells <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> are {{perceptually}} similar, {{and physiological}} data indicate some commonality of central processing. However, sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> sweet smells {{do not provide}} interchangeable contexts in psychophysical experiments. The same sweet tastes are perceived as less intense when stronger sweet <b>tastes</b> are present, <b>and</b> they are perceived as more intense when weaker sweet tastes are present, as with sweet smells. However, complementary sets of sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> smells (e. g., weak sweet tastes, strong sweet smells) do not eliminate these differential context effects (DCEs). The present experiments examined, first, whether DCEs between sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> smells arise because of differences between odors <b>and</b> <b>tastes</b> {{in the way that}} sweetness scales with intensity as concentration rises, and, second, whether DCEs may be smaller for sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> smells, when contrasted with sweet <b>tastes</b> <b>and</b> nonsweet smells. The findings were clear: DCEs were consistently present, suggesting they are independent of perceptual similarity. These results imply that DCEs are probably not psychological in origin or centrally based; rather, they may have a subcortical locus. 10 page(s...|$|R
