Comparison of the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the protozoon Trichomonas vaginalis and the pyruvate dehydrogenase {{component of the}} Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex shows that both are inactivated by incubation with pyruvate under aerobic conditions {{in the absence of}} co-substrates. However, only the former is irreversibly inhibited by incubation with hydroxypyruvate, and only the latter by incubation with bromopyruvate. Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity is potently, but reversibly, inhibited by addition of bromopyruvate in the presence of CoA, and it is suggested that the mechanism involves formation of an adduct between CoA and bromopyruvate in the active site of the enzyme.

A graphic presentation of the data allowed comparison of the active-site coupling in the various enzymes, which may differ in their lipoic acid content (one or two residues per E 2 chain).

The results of similar experiments with the E. coli α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex [2 -oxoglutarate:lipoate oxidoreductase (decarboxylating and acceptor-succinylating), EC 1. 2. 4. 2] indicate that its dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase component bears only one lipoyl moiety on each of its 24 chains. Charging of the 48 acetyl acceptor sites on the transacetylase or the 24 succinyl acceptor sites on the transsuccinylase by pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate, respectively, and <b>thiamin</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> was observed in the presence of only a few functionally active pyruvate dehydrogenase or α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase chains.

When the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex was treated with DPNH in the presence of N,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide, only transsuccinylase monomers and crosslinked transsuccinylase dimers were detected. It appears that the 48 lipoyl moieties in the transacetylase and the 24 lipoyl moieties in the transsuccinylase comprise an interacting network that functions as an acyl group and electron pair relay system through thiol-disulfide and acyl-transfer reactions among all of the lipoyl moieties...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Diabetic rats were divided into a control group (IRC) to be exposed to I/R, an ovarian I/R + 2. 2 mg/kg melatonin (IRML) group, an ovarian I/R + famotidine (IRFA) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg mirtazapine (IRMR) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg thiamine pyrophosphate (IRTP) group, and a sham operation (SO) group. Results: In the control group exposed to I/R, the levels of the oxidant parameters Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Myeloperoxidase(MPO) were significantly higher compared with the SO group, while the levels of the antioxidant parameters glutathione (GSH), Glutathioneperoxidase(GPO), Glutathione reductase (GSHRd), Glutathione S - transferase (GST), and[y 1]   Superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly lower.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methods for the analysis of N(epsilon) -(carboxymethyplysine (CML) in glucose bovine serum albumin (BSA) model systems and to investigate the possible inhibitory effect of selected compounds (a-tocopherol, ferulic acid, rutin, thiamin, thiamin monophosphate, and <b>thiamin</b> <b>pyrophosphate)</b> on CML formation. The reported levels of CML detected were dependent upon the method of analysis employed. The highest reported concentrations were obtained with the SPA biosensor, whereas the lowest were found by ELISA. However, a high correlation was observed between these two immunochemical procedures. CML concentrations were dependent upon the type and concentration of the candidate CML inhibitor. All inhibitory compounds investigated, with the exception of a-tocopherol, decreased the level of CML formation in the glucose BSA system...|$|E
