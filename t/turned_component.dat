40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for new and special alloys like nickel alloys, chrome- {{molybdenum}} alloys due to their special properties like high strength, light weight, and corrosive resistance. The present work {{is based on the}} experimental investigation of chrome-molybdenum alloy to study the effect of process parameters like cutting velocity, feed, and depth of cut on the output responses like force, surface roughness, tool wear. A full factorial design with 33 lay out with total 27 numbers of runs were carried out and optimum cutting condition for all three output responses was found out using grey relational analysis method. White layer formed in a hard <b>turned</b> <b>component</b> is mainly influenced by the abrasive wear of the tool. It has immense response on the performance of product so it is necessary to find out the white layer thickness. To investigate the machined surface properties like white layer and micro-hardness, the sliced machined surface was observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM) and micro-hardness tester respectively. It has been found that the as speed increases, the thickness of white layer increases due to increase in flank wear. Finally, a thermo-mechanical 2 D model using finite element method available in Deform 2 D TM has been prepared to investigate the output responses like force. Further, the model has been validated comparing the results of simulation with the measured results...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} investigations into Electrochemical Machining (ECM). The {{aim is to}} develop a computer program to predict the shape of a workpiece machined by the ECM process. The program is able to simulate various applications of EC machining which are drilling, milling, turning and shaped tube electrochemical drilling (STED). The program has been developed in a MATLAB environment. In this present work, EC-drilling, EC-milling and EC-turning are analysed as three-dimensional problems whereas STED is simulated in two-dimensions. Experiments have been carried out to verify the accuracy of the predicted results in the cases of EC-milling and EC-turning. The ECM modeller is based on the boundary element method (BEM) and uses Laplace's equation to determine the current distribution at nodes on the workpiece surface. In 3 D, the surfaces of the tool and the workpiece are discretised into continuous linear triangular element types whereas in 2 D, the boundaries of the tool and workpiece are discretised into linear elements. The ECM modeller is completely self-contained, i. e. it does not rely on any other commercial package. The program contains modules to automatically discretize the surfaces/boundaries of the tool and workpiece. Since the simulation of the ECM process is a temporal problem, several time steps are required to obtain the final workpiece shape. At the end of each time step, the shape of the workpiece is calculated using Faraday's laws. However, the workpiece's shape changes with progressing time steps causing the elements to become stretched and distorted. Mesh refinement techniques are built in the ECM modeller, and these subdivide the mesh automatically when necessary. The effect of time step on the predicted 3 D shape of a hole in EC-drilling is investigated. The effect of discontinuity in the slope between neighbouring elements is also studied. Results obtained from the ECM modeller are compared with 2 D analytical results to verify the accuracy that can be obtained from the ECM modeller. Milling features ranging from a simple slot to a pocket with a complex protrusion were machined {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of the EC milling process. These features were machined on a 3 -axes CNC machine converted to permit EC milling. The effect of tool geometry, tool feed rate, applied voltage and step-over distances on the dimensions, shape and surface finish of the machined features were investigated. A pocket with a human shape protrusion was machined using two different types of tool paths, namely contour-parallel and zig-zag. Both types resulted in the base surface of the pocket being concave and the final dimensions of the pockets are compared with the design drawing to determine the effect of tool path type on the accuracy of machining. The ECM modeller was used to simulate the machining of a thin-walled <b>turned</b> <b>component.</b> The machining parameters, i. e. initial gap, rotational speed, and applied voltage, were specified by the collaborating company. Since only a small amount of material had to be removed from the thin-walled component, the tool was held stationary i. e. a feed in the radial or longitudinal direction was not required. By taking advantage of the axi-symmetric nature of a <b>turned</b> <b>component,</b> only a sector of the component was analysed thereby reducing the computing time considerably. The accuracy of the modeller was verified by comparing the predicted time to machine the thin-walled component with the actual machining time. The initial investigations in STED were both experimental and numerical in nature and they studied the effect of applied voltage, tool feed rate and electrolyte pressure on the dimensions of the holes. Later investigations were numerical and an iterative methodology has been developed to calculate a set of feed rates which could machine a specified turbulator shape.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm to extract machinable volumes {{that need to}} be removed from a stock, given a boundary model of the part. Machinable implies that these volumes are extracted and arranged in a hierarchy such that each volume in the list is accessible for machining after its preceding volume has been machined. These volumes can be used to automate process planning and NC tool path generation. The algorithm identifies the cavity volumes in the part with respect to outermost faces in the part and fills them with the appropriate primitive volume to obtain the stock from which the part can be realized. Unlike the decomposition-based approaches reported, this algorithm directly identifies primitive volumes that when combined form the cavity volumes corresponding to the machining features. Primitive volumes enable handling parts with interacting features and renders redundant the additional processing of machining features required to generate a NC tool path. The primitive machinable volumes are cuboids, wedges and collars. The algorithm handles both prismatic and cylindrical (<b>turned)</b> <b>components.</b> Results of implementation for prismatic and <b>turned</b> <b>components</b> are provided and the extension of the algorithm to handle preformed stock is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Dimensional {{and form}} {{deviations}} {{that arise in}} CNC <b>turned</b> <b>components</b> due to cutting forces and thermal effects have been traditionally compensated by on-line corrections {{even when they were}} not strictly necessary. Machine-tools equipped with multiple sensors must be utilized in order to carry out these compensations what in turn leads to an increment in production costs, the occurrence of undesirable effects such as chatter as well as moving away from optimal conditions. A new approach is proposed in this work for prediction and compensation of deviations in turning by taking them into account at the planning stages prior to machining operations. The proposed model determines the admissible value of deviations in accordance to tolerance limits within the workpiece and utilizes them for setting up the appropriate operation conditions. Initial experimental steps for validating these deviation models are also described...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Biological {{materials}} typically display complex morphologies and hierarchical architectures, {{properties that}} are hardly matched by synthetic materials. Understanding the biological control of mineral properties {{will enable the}} development of new synthetic approaches toward biomimetic functional materials. Here, we combine biocombinatorial approaches with a proteome homology search and in vitro mineralization assays to assess the role of biological determinants in biomimetic magnetite mineralization. Our results suggest that the identified proteins and biomimetic polypeptides influence nucleation in vitro. Even though the in vivo role cannot be directly determined from our experiments, we can rationalize the following design principles: proteins, larger complexes, or membrane components that promote nucleation in vivo are likely to expose positively charged residues to a negatively charged crystal surface. In <b>turn,</b> <b>components</b> with acidic (negatively charged) functionality are nucleation inhibitors, which stabilize an amorphous structure through the coordination of iron. 1...|$|R

Specifically, the present paper focuses on two sequential contexts: (1) parties who have otherwise been playing a marginal role try to make themselves focal, and (2) others incorporate a previously not actively participating party. Close examination of video- and audio-recorded naturally occurring ordinary conversation reveals that one of the linguistic resources recurrently employed in these two contexts is a turn-initial discourse particle plus an additional <b>turn</b> <b>component.</b> The data also show that different particle-plus-other component structures are regularly accompanied by different body movements, which seem to embody the speaker's orientation to the degree of disjunctiveness of {{what is going to be}} projected in the particle-prefaced turn and how it relates to the current organization of interaction and its topic...|$|R

40|$|A new {{generation}} of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, called four-axis turning centers has emerged and has been growing in use due to its versatility. Multiple turrets and spindles, automated material handling, and mill/turn capabilities on these machines enhance their processing capacity and lead to substantial improvement both in quality and productivity for <b>turned</b> <b>components.</b> However, optimal process planning on these machines is considerably complicated by their improved capabilities. No current commercial Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems have considered constraint generation or process plan optimization for this class of machines. In this paper, the optimal process planning problem for four- axis turning centers is formulated as a Mixed- Integer Programming (MIP) model. The formulation is coded in GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) modeling language and the Branch- and- Bound (BB) algorithm is used to solve the problem.

40|$|AbstractNowadaysthe use of {{new high}} {{strength}} alloys is growing, but these alloys are difficult to machine due to the high temperatures generated during cutting.

Nevertheless, in order to accept a new machining process industrially, it must be assured that final structural integrity of the machined part is at least as good as that generated by conventional machining processes. Therefore, in this work it has been compared the surface integrity (roughness, hardness, residual stresses and microstructure) generated in AISI 4150 (50 CrMo 4) steel by dry turning, turning with lubricant (oil based emulsion) and cryogenic turning with LN 2.

A costing system has been evolved for <b>turned</b> <b>components</b> produced {{by a variety of}} machines; the system is based upon a fundamental cost equation which utilises in the main, the manufacturing time of the component, together with its material cost.

The generally accepted setting times for various machines have been corrected to take into account the component complexity. In estimating the material requirements, allowances have been made for material wastage, due to schedule or quantity change, scrap losses and the effect of the operator learning curve on these losses. A graphical presentation of the floor time equation enables the designer to rapidly assess variations in Ft, if he chooses to vary one, or indeed all of the parameters within his control, i. e. material, finish, size, features, etc., etc. in order to meet a certain cost target...|$|R
40|$|Algebraic {{theories}} for modeling {{components and}} their interactions offer abstraction over {{the specifics of}} component states and interfaces. For example, such theories deal with forms of sequential composition of two components in a manner independent {{of the type of}} data stored in the states of the components, and independent of the number and types of methods offered by the interfaces of the combinators. General purpose programming languages do not offer this level of abstraction, which implies that a gap must be bridged when <b>turning</b> <b>component</b> models into implementations. In this paper, we present an approach to prototyping of component-based systems that employs so-called type-level programming (or compile-time computation) {{to bridge the gap between}} abstract component models and their type-safe implementation in a functional programming language. We demonstrate our approach using Barbosa’s model of components as generalized Mealy machines. For this model, we develop a combinator library in Haskell, which uses typelevel programming with two effects. Firstly, wiring between components is computed during compilation. Secondly, the well-formedness of the component compositions is guarded byHaskell’s strong type system.
