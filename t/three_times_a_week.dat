The {{aim of this study}} is to verify if is possible reduce the PWV modifying the <b>three</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> dialysis to daily dialysis. Material and Methods. This is a controlled, randomized, cross-over study. We studied 60 oligo-anuric (urinary output < 200 mL/day) patients on chronic standard bicarbonate HD for at least 6 months. They performed three HD sessions of four hours per week. Patients were classified into three groups: normal PWV before and after dialysis (LL); high PWV before and normal PWV after dialysis (HL); high PWV before and after dialysis (HH). The patients were randomised to <b>three</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> dialysis; and daily dialysis for one month, changing dialysis schedule during second month. Results. 20 patients showed PWV-LL; 20 patients PWV-HL, and 20 patients PWVHH.

5|$|The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, {{known as}} 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669.

The Thoroughbred horse was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the General Stud Book, giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , more than the usual weight of 8–10stone (51–64kg), indicating that horse racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.|$|E

5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E
