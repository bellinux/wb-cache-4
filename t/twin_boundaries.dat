50|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{are partly}} {{responsible}} for shock hardening and {{for many of the}} changes that occur in cold work of metals with limited slip systems or at very low temperatures. They also occur due to martensitic transformations: the motion of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> is responsible for the pseudoelastic and shape-memory behavior of nitinol, and their presence is {{partly responsible for}} the hardness due to quenching of steel. In certain types of high strength steels, very fine deformation twins act as primary obstacles against dislocation motion.

50|$|Nanowires can be also grown {{without the}} help of catalysts, which gives an {{advantage}} of pure nanowires and minimizes the number of technological steps. The simplest methods to obtain metal oxide nanowires use ordinary heating of the metals, e.g. metal wire heated with battery, by Joule heating in air can be easily done at home.The vast majority of nanowire-formation mechanisms are explained through the use of catalytic nanoparticles, which drive the nanowire growth and are either added intentionally or generated during the growth. However the mechanisms for catalyst-free growth of nanowires (or whiskers) were known from 1950s. Spontaneous nanowire formation by non-catalytic methods were explained by the dislocation present in specific directions or the growth anisotropy of various crystal faces. More recently, after microscopy advancement, the nanowire growth driven by screw dislocations or <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> were demonstrated.

50|$|In {{coincident}} site lattice (CSL) theory, {{the degree}} of fit (Σ) between the structures of the two grains is described by the reciprocal of the ratio of coincidence sites to {{the total number of}} sites. In this framework, it is possible to draw the lattice for the 2 grains and count the number of atoms that are shared (coincidence sites), and the total number of atoms on the boundary (total number of site). For example, when Σ=3 there will be one atom each 3 that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary with high Σ might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low Σ. Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by dislocations, are Σ1. Some other low-Σ boundaries have special properties, especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of coincident sites. Examples include coherent <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> (e.g., Σ3) and high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., Σ7). Deviations from the ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the inclusion of dislocations at the boundary.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotation}} of the cells {{is a consequence of}} the large magnetic anisotropy of MSM alloys, and the high mobility of the internal regions. Simply speaking, an MSM element is composed by internal regions, each having a different orientation of the elementary cells (the regions are shown by the figure in green and blue colors). These regions are called twin-variants. The application of a magnetic field or of an external stress shifts the boundaries of the variants, called <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and thus favors one variant or the other. When the element is completely contracted or completely elongated, it is formed by only one variant and it is said to be in a single variant state. The magnetization of the MSM element along a fixed direction differs if the element is in the contraction or in the elongation single variant state. The magnetic anisotropy is the difference between the energy required to magnetize the element in contraction single variant state and in elongation single variant state. The value of the anisotropy is related to the maximum work-output of the MSM alloy, and thus to the available strain and force {{that can be used for}} applications.|$|E

The coherent <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> provides high barrier to slip transmission. The dislocation pile-up modifies the stress field at its intersection with the grain boundary.

30|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthen nanowires regardless of their morphology—that is, the strength of nanowires goes up as twin spacing goes down. This article shows that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> do not always strengthen nanowires. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, the authors show that whether <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthen nanowires depends on the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation, which in turn depends on surface morphologies. When nanowires are circular cylindrical, the necessary stress of dislocation nucleation is high {{and the presence of}} <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> lowers this stress; <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> soften nanowires. In contrast, when nanowires are square cylindrical, the necessary stress of dislocation nucleation is low, and a higher stress is required for dislocations to penetrate twin boundaries; they strengthen nanowires.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{molecular}} dynamics simulations on nano-twinned copper nanowires reveal that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{do not always}} strengthen metallic nanowires. For nanowires with square cross-sections, strength increases as twin spacing decreases. In contrast, strength varies little with twin spacing for nanowires with circular cross-sections; the strength with a <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> is slightly lower than that in single crystals. Whether <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthening metallic nanowires depends on the necessary stress required for dislocation nucleation, which in turn depends on the surface morphology of the nanowires. For nanowires with square cross-sections, the existence of sharp edges makes dislocation nucleation feasible at a lower stress than that needed for dislocation penetration through the <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries,</b> leading to a twin-spacing dependence of strength. For nanowires with circular cross-sections, the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation is high, so penetration requires no additional increase of stress. At the same time, the presence of intersections of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> and surfaces facilitates dislocation nucleation, leading to slight softening because <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> are present.|$|E

The triangular structure appeared to be energetically much more favourable, independent of the various interatomic potentials employed. ...|$|R

30|$|First, we {{analyze the}} {{necessary}} stress for dislocation nucleation at surfaces versus that for dislocation penetration of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries,</b> {{the latter being}} stress for yielding. According to Zhu et al. [24], dislocation nucleation stress or activation volume depends on surface conditions. With square cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is low, and additional stress is necessary for dislocations to penetrate <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Therefore, the presence of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> leads to increase of yield stress, as shown in Fig. 2. With circular cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is high, and this stress suffices for yielding also. Therefore the presence of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> leads no increase of yield stress. In addition, this presence introduces intersections of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> and surfaces and thereby reduces the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation; this necessary stress is the highest for non-twinned nanowire.|$|E

40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>boundary</b> {{motion is}} the {{mechanism}} {{that drives the}} plastic deformation in magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs), and is largely dependent on the twin microstructure of the MSMA. The twin microstructure is established during the martensitic transformation, and can be influenced through thermo-magneto-mechanical training. For self-accommodated and ineffectively trained martensite, twin thickness and magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS) are very small. For effectively trained crystals, a single crystallographic domain may comprise the entire sample and MFIS reaches the theoretical limit. In this paper, a numerical simulation is presented describing the twin microstructures and <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> motion of self-accommodated martensite using disclinations and disconnections (twinning dislocations). Disclinations are line defects such as dislocations, however with a rotational displacement field. A quadrupole solution was chosen to approximate the defect structure where two quadrupoles represent an elementary twin double layer unit. In the simulation, the <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> was inclined to the twinning plane which required the introduction of twinning disconnections, which are line defects with a stress field similar to dislocations.
