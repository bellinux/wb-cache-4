The Leibniz-Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) at Kühlungsborn, Germany (54 ° N, 12 ° E) operates two lidar instruments, using three different temperature measurement methods, optimized for three altitude ranges: (1) Probing the spectral Doppler broadening of the potassium D 1 resonance lines with a tunable narrow-band laser allows atmospheric temperature profiles to be determined at metal layer altitudes (80 ? 105 km). (2) Between about 20 and 90 km, temperatures were calculated from Rayleigh backscattering by air molecules, where the upper start values for the calculation algorithm {{were taken from the}} potassium lidar results. Correction methods have been applied to account for, e. g. Rayleigh extinction or Mie scattering of aerosols below about 32 km. (3) At altitudes below about 25 km, backscattering in the Rotational Raman lines is strong enough to obtain temperatures by measuring the temperature dependent spectral shape of the Rotational Raman spectrum. This method works well down to about 1 km. The instrumental configurations of the IAP lidars were optimized for a 3 ? 6 km overlap of the temperature profiles at the method <b>transition</b> <b>altitudes.</b> We present two night-long measurements with clear wave structures propagating from the lower stratosphere up to the lower thermosphere...|$|R

50|$|Flight levels (FL) {{are used}} by air traffic {{controllers}} to simplify the vertical separation of aircraft and one exists every 1000 feet relative to an agreed pressure level. Above a transitional altitude, which varies from country to country, the worldwide arbitrary pressure datum of 1013.25 millibar or the equivalent setting of 29.92 inches of mercury is entered into the altimeter and altitude is then {{referred to as a}} flight level. The altimeter reading is converted to a flight level by removing the trailing two zeros: for example, 29000 feet becomes FL290. When the pressure at sea level is by chance the international standard then the flight level is also the altitude. To avoid confusion, below the <b>transition</b> <b>altitude,</b> height is referred to as a numeric altitude, for example 'descend 5000 feet' and above the <b>transition</b> <b>altitude,</b> 'climb flight level 250'.|$|E
40|$|The {{aircraft}} energy-climb {{trajectory for}} configurations {{with a sharp}} transonic drag rise is well known to possess two branches in the altitude/Mach-number plane. <b>Transition</b> in <b>altitude</b> between the two branches occurs instantaneously, a 'corner' in the minimum-time solution obtained with the energy-state model.

With a singular-perturbation approach, a 'boundary-layer' correction is obtained for each altitude jump, the transonic jump being a so-called 'internal' boundary layer, different in character from the initial and terminal layers.

40|$|Snow cover maps provide {{information}} of great practical interest for hydrologic purposes: {{when combined with}} point values of snow water equivalent (SWE), they enable estimation of the regional snow resource. In this context, Earth observation satellites are an interesting tool for evaluating large scale snow distribution and extension. MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on board Terra and Aqua satellites) daily Snow Covered Area product has been widely tested and proved to be appropriate for hydrologic applications. However, within a daily map the presence of cloud cover can hide the ground, thus obstructing snow detection. Here, we consider MODIS binary products for daily snow mapping over the Po River basin. Ten years (2003 – 2012) of MOD 10 A 1 and MYD 10 A 1 snow maps have been analysed and processed {{with the support of}} a 500 m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We first investigate the issue of cloud obstruction, highlighting its dependence on altitude and season. Snow maps seem to suffer the influence of overcast conditions mainly in mountain and during the melting period. Thus, cloud cover highly influences those areas where snow detection is regarded with more interest. In spring, the average percentages of area lying beneath clouds are in the order of 70 %, for altitudes over 1000 m a. s. l. Then, starting from previous studies, we propose a cloud removal procedure and we apply it to a wide area, characterized by high geomorphological heterogeneity such as the Po River basin. In conceiving the new procedure, our first target was to preserve the daily temporal resolution of the product. Regional snow and land lines were estimated for detecting snow cover dependence on elevation. In cases when there was not enough information on the same day within the cloud-free areas, we used temporal filters with the aim of reproducing the micro-cycles which characterize the <b>transition</b> <b>altitudes,</b> where snow does not stand continually over the entire winter. In the validation stage, the proposed procedure was compared against others, showing improvements in the performance for our case study. The accuracy is assessed by applying the procedure to clear-sky maps masked with additional cloud cover. The average value is higher than 95 % considering 40 days chosen over all seasons. The procedure also has advantages in terms of input data and computational effort requirements...|$|R

Contrary to the accepted doctrine, the flow separation in sea level mode will not be continuously fixed at the contour inflection.

40|$|The {{effective}} use of cockpit displays of traffic information is largely dependent upon {{the degree to which}} vertical status and trend information can be presented simply and unambiguously to the pilot. The traditional use of plan-view displays has been challenged by other representations, each having its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Although perspective-view displays, for example, may be very useful, they suffer from potential overlaid symbology causing obscuration or clutter along specific viewing vectors. An alternate approach is to use color encoding techniques to represent vertical trend information in a plan-view horizontal situation display. Static and dynamic color coding techniques were used in such a display where stratified vertical sectors were represented by stereotypic colors (greenkafe; yellow/caution; red/danger) with an additional color cue for intruder above/below. The static representation depicted the symbol in the appropriate color or a 50 / 50 combination of colors to represent transitions between zones. The dynamic presentation used a continuously changing ratio of colors within the sym-bol to show this same <b>transition</b> between <b>altitude</b> zones as an attempt to provide rate and depth-of-penetration cues. Perform-ances of nonpilots and pilots using these displays were obtained in a simulation setting and compared with performances ob-tained using numeric/symbolic encoding of the same information.

Energetic particle precipitation results in the lowering of the <b>transition</b> <b>altitude,</b> by 10 km in one case when energetic particles deposited ∼ 20 ergs/cm² s in the atmosphere.

40|$|Abstract. – The Pliocene {{period in}} the Montpellier region, {{considered}} as being emblematic {{since the middle of}} the 19 th century because of its diverse mammal fauna, has not received much innovative treatment over the last 30 years. In par-ticular, there has been no reinterpretation of geological data {{in the light of the}} Messinian-Zanclean double eustasy and related mechanisms. And yet, the increase in the number of urban projects affecting the Pliocene terrains and substra-tum has allowed for a renewed analysis of these areas in conformity with the results obtained in the nearby valley of the Rhône river. Highlighting the discordance, the regressive Messinian erosion has allowed for the Pliocene fluviatile net-work of the Lez to emerge. This in turn has made possible the reconstruction of a digitate network that recorded all of the phases of the filling in of these Pliocene rias. This is particularly clear thanks to the study of the Messinian discor-dance in the hard rocks of the Montpellier fold on the one hand, and on the other, within the Neogene ditches. Since the Messinian, the course of the Mosson and Lez rivers, just as that of the Vidourle river, tracked heavily to the east. This is how the Pliocene Mosson river crossed the Montpellier fold. In fact these modifications of the river courses, made pos-sible by the reuse, until the end of the Pliocene, of the erosion surfaces of the coastal links (the Montpellier fold, the Gardiole), correspond to the accentuation of the deformations of these surfaces. The amplitude and variability of these movements is a result of the altitude of the marine-continental Pliocene <b>transition.</b> This <b>altitude</b> is doubtless often rather approximate, but it differs considerably with respect to the coastal Jurassic ranges (the Montpellier fold to the north, th...|$|R
