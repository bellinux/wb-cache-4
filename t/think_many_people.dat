2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
2500|$|Wales' maiden {{appearance}} in the tournament, {{it was also the}} only time all four of the Home Nations qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and Northern Ireland made it past the group stage. The Welsh FA were pessimistic for their prospects, and before the tournament they arranged for five days of training on some free land at Hyde Park and booked the flights home for before the beginning of the knockout stages. Manager Jimmy Murphy used highly defensive tactics, they would prove highly effective as Wales never conceded more than once in any of their five games in the tournament. Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary, Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. Wales had played well against the Hungarians but played poorly against the Mexicans, though they still came close to recording two victories; in the third match both the Swedes and the Welsh were happy to amble to a draw, as that way both sides remained in the competition. As Hungary also recorded three points in the group, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the Råsunda Stadium to advance with a 2–1 win; however due to dirty play from the opposition John Charles was injured in the match and missed out {{on the rest of the}} tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, thanks to a goal by Pelé in the 66th minute – this was only Pelé's second game for his country, and the goal made him the youngest player ever to score in a World Cup game. Charles later recalled that Pelé miskicked the ball, and even in later life it upset him greatly to remember the ball trickling across the line. Pelé himself said that Charles was the best centre-half of the tournament, and the Brazilian swapped shirts with Charles after the game. The Brazilians went on to win the competition. It was a difficult experience for Wales, who were forced to play five highly competitive games in eleven days. Despite their heroics, the competition received little publicity in Britain at the time – the South Wales Evening Post's back page headlined a Glamorgan cricket match – and Charles said in his autobiography that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in Wales even knew the World Cup was on." ...|$|E

Hathaway told Variety that she <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> relate to Andy's predicament of working for someone who seems impossible to please.

I doubt if any untravelled American can realize how much of Europe is already broken up.

60|$|I {{sometimes}} fancy {{that every}} great city {{must have been}} built by night. At least, it is only at night that every part of a great city is great. All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. At least, I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> of those nobler trades that work by night (journalists, policemen, burglars, coffee-stall keepers, and such mistaken enthusiasts as refuse to go home till morning) must often have stood admiring some black bulk of building with a crown of battlements or a crest of spires and then burst into tears at daybreak to discover {{that it was only}} a haberdasher's shop with huge gold letters across the face of it.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the song, Shannon states: [...] "..this song is such {{a strong}} ballad and has a {{personal}} message for me. It is a song which I wrote when I was 17. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> {{will be able to}} relate to the message in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was just}} reading {{a review of}} a movie called Watchmen that uses it and the {{reviewer}} said – [...] "Can we please have a moratorium on 'Hallelujah' in movies and television shows?"

5000|$|A {{rock concert}} is [...] "kicking television." [...] If you're {{out of the}} house and with a bunch of people enjoying {{something}} together, that's kicking television to me.

5000|$|It was {{announced}} on 1 April 2011, that the band had departed from their record label Sony after {{a dispute over}} the promotion of their latest album The Illusion of Safety.

5000|$|Commenting on the role, actor Michael Starke said, [...] "There {{are going}} to be {{parallels}} between them and other families but the show is so unique I'm hoping we'll create our own niche".

5000|$|... "The {{racial or}} ethnic end of it was not {{immediately}} apparent to me. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> first get involved in racial politics, and then later decide that maybe Odinism or Asatrú attracts them. With me, it was quite the reverse as I was attracted to the religion first, simply for its own value, {{and it was only}} later, that I began to realize that there's an inherent connection between one's ethnicity and the religion that they follow." [...] — Stephen McNallen.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff {{confessed to}} me his great remorse for his crimes. He {{wished he could}} do {{something}} for the families of his victims to make it right, but {{there was nothing he could}} do. He turned to God because there was no one else to turn to, but he showed great courage in his daring to ask the question, ‘Is heaven for me too?’ I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are resentful of him for asking that question. But he dared to ask, and he dared to believe the answer.|$|E
5000|$|Well, what I meant {{really was}} {{that some of the}} fears of street crime and some of the {{stereotypes}} that go along with that were responses that I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> feel. She's not extraordinary in that regard. She is somebody that I love as much as anybody. I mean, she has literally helped to raise me. But those are fears that are embedded in our culture, and embedded in our society, and even within our own families, even within a family like mine that is diverse.|$|E

60|$|Uncharitable persons, {{saying that}} a Spaniard will live for a week on bread and water duly to prepare himself for a meal at another's expense, accuse them of gluttony; but I have always found the Andalusians abstemious eaters, nor have I {{wondered}} at this, since Spanish food is abominable. But drunkards they often are. I should <b>think</b> as <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in proportion get drunk in Seville as in London, though it is only fair to add that their heads are not strong, and very little alcohol will produce in them an indecent exhilaration.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Court Theatre held a 70th Birthday {{retrospective}} {{of her work}} by presenting readings of many of her most famous plays directed by notable playwrights, including Martin Crimp and Mark Ravenhill.Of course it's possible to trace recurring themes in Churchill's work - alienation between parent and child, the possibility and failure of revolution. But it is the variety of her work that is most striking. As Von Mayenburg says: [...] "With each play, she discovers new genres and forms. She then discards them and moves on, opening up possibilities for other playwrights to explore. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> writing today don't even realise they've been influenced by her. She's changed the language of theatre. And very few playwrights do that." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film is Verhoeven's {{most recent}} American production. In 2013, Verhoeven remarked to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I decided after Hollow Man, {{this is a}} movie, the first movie that I made that I thought I should not have made. It made money and this and that, {{but it really is}} not me anymore. I think many other people could have done that. I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could have made RoboCop that way, or either Starship Troopers. But Hollow Man, I thought there might have been 20 {{directors}} in Hollywood who could have done that. I felt depressed with myself after 2002." [...] It partly contributed in his return to the Netherlands, his home country, where he made Black Book in 2006, which was considered a return to form.|$|E
5000|$|The song has {{country and}} R&B influence, which Hunt {{expressed}} {{in an article}} with Billboard. Shane McAnally said of the influence: [...] "It's a model that I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could learn from, because you are still evolving as an artist along the way. Just because you put music out, it doesn't mean that is where you stop for the next year." [...] Hunt then discussed {{the process of making}} the song, saying it was born when he was [...] "singing that chorus melody late one night while riding around {{trying to come up with}} song ideas." [...] He originally [...] "didn't want to write anymore break up songs," [...] but the melody of the song changed his mind, saying it [...] "fit too perfectly not to go with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed about}} his lyrical content with Faith No More, Patton responded, [...] "I <b>think</b> that too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> {{too much about}} my lyrics.

5000|$|From 1987 to 1988, William Quandt was President of the Middle East Studies Association, {{a learned}} society. He joined the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia in 1994, where {{he holds the}} {{departmental}} Edward R. Stettinius chair. He teaches courses on the Middle East and American Foreign Policy. From 2000 to 2003, he also served as their Vice Provost for International Affairs. In 2004, {{he was elected to}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. After the fall semester of 2012, Quandt will retire from his teaching career at UVa. Professor Schulhofer-Wohl, his replacement, commended his legacy by point out that [...] "more than 200 students take class every year, and that's clearly due in no small part to Dr. Quandt and what he brings to it.

5000|$|Regarding [...] "Blow Up the Outside World", drummer Matt Cameron {{stated that}} [...] "there's certain points in that tune {{that are just}} a really nice, {{emotional}} crunch that happens somehow ... that one in particular, that made my girlfriend cry {{the first time she}} heard it". Thayil on the song:A nice ironic, final single in a way. People said there was a Beatles-ish element. I suppose there is a bit of Paul McCartney {{and a little bit of}} Lennon in the flavour of the song. Everyone in the band grew up with the Beatles and we had a certain degree of respect and admiration for them that's not uncommon. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were Beatles fans, especially for that period in time. There's a number of acoustic guitars on the track as well and then, towards the end of the song, it gets louder and aggressive and goes to these power chords, and is maybe a little reminiscent of AC/DC.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2015, Baverstock {{said of the}} Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} {{that it was in}} breach of international laws prohibiting the dumping of radioactivity into the sea. He stated his belief the media, with particular reference to Europe, was under-reporting the ongoing problems at Fukushima. Of the general public's perception, he said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would be very surprised that it was still a matter for discussion. They would be even more surprised to learn that it’s still an ongoing accident, and that it hasn’t terminated yet… and they would be more surprised to learn that nobody knows how to stop it."Since the year 2000, Baverstock's work has been published in various medical and scientific journals, including The Journal of Physiology, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, Progress in Biophysics & Molecular Biology, The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Mutation Research, Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, British Medical Journal (BMJ), Radiation Protection Dosimetry, PLoS One, Energy & Environment, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Environmental Health Perspectives, Nature, Journal of Radiological Protection, Medicine, Conflict and Survival and Science.|$|E

At the 11 December 1943 concert at Carnegie Hall, he said, [...] "We thought we wouldn't play it (Black, Brown and Beige) {{in its entirety}} tonight because it represents an awfully long and important story and that I don't <b>think</b> too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> {{are familiar with the}} story. This is the one we dedicate to the 700 Negroes who came from Haiti to save Savannah during the Revolutionary War"(referring to the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue).
