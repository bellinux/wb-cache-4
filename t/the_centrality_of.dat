5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. <b>The</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of {{inspiration}} for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> {{the doctrine of}} not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that {{does not apply to}} anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
30|$|For scale-free {{networks}} [35], {{the distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> betweenness <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertices {{has been observed}} to follow a power-law pattern (similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degree <b>centrality)</b> [37]. It was also observed in [38] that for scale-free networks that are either dissortative [12] or neutral with respect to node degree, the average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> betweenness <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbors of a vertex is proportional to <b>the</b> betweenness <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertex considered; whereas, for assortative scale-free networks, <b>the</b> betweenness <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbors of a vertex is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> betweenness <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertex considered.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> degree <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a vertex is {{the number}} of neighbors {{connected}} to the vertex and can be determined just based on the one-hop neighborhood knowledge. <b>The</b> eigenvector <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a vertex {{is a measure of the}} degree of the vertex as well as the degree of its neighbors. <b>The</b> betweenness <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a vertex is a measure of the fraction of the shortest paths between any two vertices that go through the vertex; whereas <b>the</b> closeness <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a vertex is a measure of the shortest path distances to every other vertex in the network. Other than degree <b>centrality,</b> all <b>the</b> above three <b>centrality</b> metrics require <b>the</b> global knowledge of the network for their computation.|$|R
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
