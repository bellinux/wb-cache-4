5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. <b>The</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

30|$|Essentially, {{these methods}} over-recorded the objects and, for this project, {{provided}} unneeded {{detailed information on}} surface textures and damage caused by erosion and vandalism. Depending {{on the number of}} perspectives necessary to capture the entire object, then, the final file size could be prohibitively large. (The size of the file becomes problematic not because of storage space, but because of the amount of memory required on a computer to work with such a large file). On a practical front, <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> expensive, required professional upkeep and a trained operator to record and process the data. Frequently, <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> held up in customs for interminable lengths of time; similar <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> difficult to find in the country and, when it was, the accuracy and usability of <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> in serious question. The use of such specialized hardware and software was simply not sustainable in a rural environment of the high Andes, where the harsh climate could easily damage equipment. In these environmental and bureaucratic situations, breakages and technical issues, even when the fix could be relatively easy in the proper circumstances, often meant that <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> essentially unusable.|$|R

25|$|Compared to scuba diving, {{dressing}} the diver in is {{a relatively}} laborious process, as <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> bulky and fairly heavy, and several components are connected together by hoses.

25|$|Mixing by gas separation: a {{nitrogen}} permeable membrane is used {{to remove}} some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low pressure air until the required mix is achieved.

25|$|A dive boat {{will not}} be {{carrying}} a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving support vessel, so treatment {{would be limited to}} oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may choose to do in-water recompression.|$|E
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} difference {{lies in the}} choice of AC or DC.
