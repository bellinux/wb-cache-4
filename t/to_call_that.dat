5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E

25|$|This World Series win had {{significance}} for McCarver and Harry Kalas. Both had been Phillies broadcasters in , but neither had gotten <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> year's World Series. McCarver was a backup commentator for Game of the Week on NBC, {{but he was}} not part of the network's Series announcing team. For Kalas, MLB radio-broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the Commissioner's Office, demanding a change to the rule. The following year, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers, due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans. In 2008, both called the Phillies' World Series win.|$|E

25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, and squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E

After police questioned him, {{he said he had}} given the yellow business card to a man at the La Quinta motel in Brownsville, and told him <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> number if he was ever arrested. Investigators knew that this motel in downtown Brownsville was a meeting place for low-level criminals. The sheriff's office began investigating the people who had stayed at the motel in previous months. Cuellar put the police in contact with Ramiro Moya, a San Antonio resident, who frequented Brownsville, and claimed to know details on the murder. Moya led the police to his half-brother Daniel [...] "El Güero" [...] Orlando Garza, a San Antonio painter who frequented Brownsville and Mexico.|$|E
500|$|On 13 June {{walruses}} {{attacked and}} damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they {{prepared to leave}} again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, {{and a few minutes}} later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>that</b> summer. As he approached, Jackson saw [...] "a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease".

40|$|Spring peepers and cricket frogs produce {{advertisement}} <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> attract females. As ectotherms {{their body}} temperatures are greatly affected by ambient air temperature. Some characteristics of their advertisement calls are correlated with temperature. I analyzed advertisement calls of both species recorded in western-central Indiana. I compared call characteristic correlations with temperature {{found in our}} populations to those in populations in other geographic areas and found similar trends throughout the range of both species. Secondly, I examined aggressive calls in the spring peepers. Aggressive calls are used in male-male interactions, and in the spring peeper are a distinct call type different from advertisement calls in two characteristics. I used a habituation-discrimination protocol to test {{which of the two}} <b>call</b> characteristics, <b>that</b> differ between advertisement and aggressive <b>calls,</b> males use <b>to</b> distinguish advertisement and aggressive <b>calls.</b> I found <b>that</b> males responded with intermediate aggression <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> only differ from advertisement in one of the two characteristics and responded with the most aggression <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>that</b> differed from advertisement calls in both characteristics...|$|R
