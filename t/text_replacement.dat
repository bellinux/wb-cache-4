2500|$|Users have {{reported}} a bug in the default iOS keyboard, in which pressing [...] "I" [...] {{resulted in the}} system rendering the text as [...] "!" [...] or [...] "A" [...] along with an incomprehensible symbol featuring a question mark in a box. The symbol is known as Variation Selector 16 for its intended purpose of merging two characters into an emoji. Apple acknowledged the issue in a support document, advising users {{to set up a}} <b>Text</b> <b>Replacement</b> feature in their device's keyboard settings as a temporary workaround. The company confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that devices using older iOS 11 versions, as opposed to just the latest 11.1 version {{at the time of the}} publication, were affected by the issue, and an Apple spokesperson announced that [...] "A fix will be released very soon". iOS 11.1.1 was released on November 9, 2017, fixing the issue.|$|E

50|$|<b>Text</b> <b>replacement,</b> replace-as-you-type or autocorrect is an {{automatic}} data validation function {{commonly found in}} word processors and text editing interfaces for smartphones and tablet computers. Its principal purpose is {{as part of the}} spell checker to correct common spelling or typing errors, saving time for the user. It is also used to automatically format text or insert special characters by recognizing particular character usage, saving the user from having to use more tedious functions.|$|E

This {{discards}} whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust to simple <b>text</b> <b>replacements.</b> Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.|$|R
5000|$|In certain situations, {{automatic}} corrections {{can cause}} problems. This is particularly so in technical and scientific writing. For example, the biochemical {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "cyclic AMP", which in turn is abbreviated to [...] "cAMP". A <b>text</b> <b>replacement</b> function may regard this capitalization to be erroneous, and so change it to [...] "Camp", which in the context of biochemistry is incorrect. Older automatic-correction algorithms can cause problems even in nontechnical writing; the Cupertino effect was an example: cooperation (which some dictionaries would not recognize unless hyphenated co-operation) became Cupertino.|$|E
5000|$|The {{replacement}} {{list for}} <b>text</b> <b>replacement</b> {{can also be}} modified by the user, allowing the user to use shortcuts. If, for example, the user is writing an essay on the industrial revolution, a replacement key {{can be set up}} to replace [...] "ir" [...] with [...] "industrial revolution", saving the user time whenever they want to type it. For users with the patience, this facility can even be used to create a complete keyboard shorthand system, along lines similar to those of Dutton Speedwords, but with short forms instantly replaced by full forms.|$|E
5000|$|Misuse of <b>text</b> <b>replacement</b> {{software}} is a staple practical joke in many schools and offices. Typically, the prankster {{will set the}} victim's word processing software to replace an extremely common word with a humorous absurdity, or an incorrectly spelled version of the original word. The growing use of autocorrection on smartphones has also led to popular websites and blogs where people post and share humorous or embarrassing cases of improper autocorrections. Deliberate AutoCorrect is when people write something and sarcastically [...] "correct" [...] their Deliberate AutoCorrect with an Asterisk followed with the sarcastic [...] "correction".|$|E
50|$|For instance, in vi, {{replacing}} a word is <b>replacement</b> <b>text,</b> {{which is a}} combination of two independent commands (change and word-motion) together with a transition into and out of insert mode. Text between the cursor position {{and the end of the}} word is overwritten by the <b>replacement</b> <b>text.</b> The operation can be repeated at some other location by typing , the effect being that the word starting that location will be replaced with the same <b>replacement</b> <b>text.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} trions, pairing and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional strongly attractive three-component ultracold fermions in external fields. Exact results for the groundstate energy, critical fields, magnetization and phase diagrams are obtained analytically from the Bethe ansatz solutions. Driven by Zeeman splitting, the system shows exotic phases of trions, bound pairs, a normal Fermi liquid and four mixtures of these states. Particularly, a smooth phase transition from a trionic phase into a pairing phase occurs as the highest hyperfine level separates from the two lower energy levels. In contrast, there is a smooth phase transition from the trionic phase into a normal Fermi liquid as the lowest level separates from the two higher levels.

40|$|Computer {{generated}} 3 d-models of buildings, {{cities and}} whole landscapes are constantly gaining importance throughout different fields of application. Starting with obvious domains like computer games or movies {{there are also}} lots of other areas, e. g. reconstructions of historic cities both for educational reasons and further research. The most widely used method for producing city models is the „manual“ creation. A 3 d artist uses modeling software to design every single component by hand. Especially for city models consisting of {{hundreds or thousands of}} buildings this is a very time consuming and thus expensive method. Procedural modeling offers an alternative to this manual approach by using a computer to generate models automatically. The history of procedural modeling algorithms goes back to the 1980 s when the first implementations for the automatic texture synthesis were developed and published by Ken Perlin. Other important applications are the generation of plants based on formalisms like L-systems, proposed by Aristid Lindenmayer or particle systems widely used within computer graphics first proposed by William Reeves. Research concerning the applicability of the developed formalisms and techniques {{led to the creation of}} systems dedicated to the automatical computation of building and city models. These systems are often differentiated between rule-based and procedural systems. Rule-based systems use formalisms like <b>text</b> <b>replacement</b> systems whereas procedural systems implement every step of the construction process within the program code. The Semantic Building Modeler is a procedural system, which is configured by using user-provided XML-parameters. The semantic meaning of these parameters is fixed through a tight coupling with their usage within the program code. In this point, the semantic of the Semantic Building Modeler differs from other systems on the today’s market. Besides, it facilitates the introduction for novice users making their first experiences with procedural modeling. Concerning the algorithmic aspect the system proposes two new algorithms for the automatic creation and variation of building footprints. These enable the software to create automatically varied building structures. Additionally, the prototype implementation can be seen as an extendable framework. It offers a wide range of algorithms and methods, which can be used for future extensions of the current system. The prototype also contains an implementation of the Weighted-Straight-Skeleton-Algorithm, techniques for the distributed storage of configuration-fragments, the procedural construction of building components like cornice and many more. The prototypical realization of the developed algorithms is a proof-of-concept-implementation. It demonstrates that the usage of semantically based parameters for the procedural creation of complex and visually appealing geometry can go hand-in-hand. This opens the powerful algorithmic construction of building and city models to a big group of users who have no experience neither in the field of programming nor in the manual design of 3 d models. ...|$|E

Also, it means that in the end, users are unable to perceive the contents of an image (Hyun and Kim 2008). As the provision of <b>replacement</b> <b>text</b> for an image can be utilized when a search engine interprets image, both the disabled and ordinary people can receive benefits.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{evaluate}} the flexibility and richness of two well-established text analysis plagiarism tools, {{through a consideration}} of the use of plagiarism detection software as a mechanism for the automated assessment of student-created narrative in a virtual learning environment (VLE). The authors are currently engaged in a project creating a prototype VLE, using technologies for multilevel and multiplayer games, based on the inherent support such an environment would provide for constructivist learning, engagement, and contextual socialization. Progress between levels in the VLE will be based on the creation, by the student, of a narrative linking together a number of conceptual elements obtained through game-play at that level. Support for the narrative creation process will help the student to contextualize the conceptual elements, providing the necessary linking elements or themes to enable the student to produce a coherent description of their understanding of the concepts. A particular challenge in such environments is the need for fast, real-time feedback to students to maintain the level of engagement and to support the game-play metaphor. Additionally, the student must be able to make as many attempts to progress as they need and it will be their decision when and how often to submit for assessment. Since the student narrative will be in a textual form and can therefore be related to a sample solution narrative, generated by the author of the level within the learning environment, the idea of using plagiarism detection software as the mechanism for automated comparison and assessment was considered appropriate for investigation. While the limitation of such tools would appear to be that they are seeking direct copies of text elements, the authors wanted to investigate whether they offered sufficient richness and fuzziness to detect common conceptually-linked texts. The initial decision was to experiment with text-analytic tools, since they a- re both widely used and readily available. The tools chosen were TurnItIn, a commercial tool provided to the U. K. higher education community by the U. K. Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), and VALT/VAST, a set of tools created at the Centre for Interactive Systems Engineering at London South Bank University, London, U. K., the workings of which are based on recognized and well-published research. An experiment using a small group of students in a traditional assessment situation was carried out, and is described in detail. The rationale for this approach was that there is not yet a fully working prototype of the VLE in which to carry out such an experiment, but that the conditions necessary to test the hypothesis that plagiarism tools could be utilized for such a purpose could be replicated sufficiently to make such an experiment viable. The results of the experiment demonstrated neither a correlation between the sample solution and student solutions, nor any correlation between the individual student solutions, proving the null hypothesis. This result demonstrates that these tools are not useful for the development of automated assessment within the VLE, and the authors are now giving consideration to the use of lexical analysis/tokenizer and other tools. However, it also suggests that these text-analytic plagiarism tools are too firmly focused on direct copy, which does raise {{the question of whether or}} not they offer enough richness and fuzziness to detect a sophisticated plagiarism attempt using, for example, <b>text</b> <b>replacement</b> tools. An ongoing close relationship between research in automated assessment and plagiarism detection is also proposed, to achieve mutual benefit...|$|E
