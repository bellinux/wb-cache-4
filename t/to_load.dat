5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse <b>to</b> <b>load</b> ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition <b>to</b> <b>load</b> the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E

She soon was fighting her way through Hurricane Ella which caused her to alter her course to avoid the most severe part of the storm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on compressibility due <b>to</b> <b>loading</b> and a collapse potential upon wetting of cemented loose sands, which is proposed {{to be used}} as a material for construction of artificial aquifer. The experiments were performed on the cemented loose sand samples with various cement contents and periods of curing time. The results show a decrease in compressibility due <b>to</b> <b>loading</b> and collapse potential upon wetting of cemented loose sand with increasing period of curing time. Moreover, it was found that, with increasing applied stress, the compressibility due <b>to</b> <b>loading</b> increased while the collapse potential upon wetting decreased. The total compression due <b>to</b> both <b>loading</b> and wetting increased with increasing applied stress...|$|R

5|$|She {{arrived at}} Sydney on 24 August, {{and had her}} hangars {{refitted}} to accommodate Allied PoWs and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximize the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 25 September, where she loaded over 2,000 American and Canadian PoWs. She dropped off the Americans at Pearl Harbor on 5 October and continued on to deliver her Canadian passengers at Vancouver six days later. Opened for public tours, Implacable remained for a week before sailing to Hong Kong to pick up several hundred PoWs and continued onwards to Manila <b>to</b> <b>load</b> 2,114 more passengers. She delivered them to Balikpapan, Borneo for transhipment to Britain. In their place the carrier embarked 2,126 men of the 7th Australian Division, and their equipment, to return to Australia. She arrived at Sydney on 17 November and sailed on 8 December <b>to</b> <b>load</b> more returning troops from Papua New Guinea. Arriving back at Sydney before Christmas, the ship had her additional bunks, etc., removed to return her to operational status.|$|E

5|$|The object element: The eyes also {{test support}} of the HTML object element. The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 it still was not completely supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important because it allows for content fallback—if an object fails <b>to</b> <b>load,</b> then the browser can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E

A complex palette system was implemented as well, allowing each level <b>to</b> <b>load</b> its own unique palette.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers <b>to</b> <b>load</b> a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained <b>to</b> <b>load</b> film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used <b>to</b> <b>load</b> the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used <b>to</b> <b>load,</b> save, or quit the game.|$|E
