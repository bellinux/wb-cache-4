Due to its remote location Stemnitsa served as a relatively safe haven from the Ottomans, {{and it became a}} centre of Greek culture and religion. Many old churches from this period have been preserved. The church of Bafero was built in 1185 and the Zoodochos in 1433. The two larger churches are Ai-Giorgis and Agia Paraskevi. The first mention, some say, of the word Stemnitsa, was found in Ottoman <b>taxation</b> <b>documents</b> dated 1512-1515 where the number of families appeared to be about 120. This information was published by professor John Alexandropoulos. In the Grimani Venetian Census report Stemnitsa was shown as the most populous village in Gortynia with 925 people.|$|R

40|$|This work {{seeks to}} explore the {{progress}} of rural settlement and colonization in the county of Worcestershire in the period prior to the Black Death of 1349. The study is organised into three sections, {{each of which is}} based upon particular forms of evidence. Thus, the first part utilises archaeological, place name and charter evidence to establish settlement patterns in the pre-conquest period. The second part makes a detailed study of the Domesday evidence for the county, utilising simple statistical techniques to establish relationships within the data and to identify local Domesday economies. The final part uses a wide range of manorial, Exchequer and <b>Taxation</b> <b>documents</b> to chart the post-conquest progress of colonization, settlement initiation and woodland clearance. The impact of these developments upon selected local Domesday economies, identified in part two, is achieved by the study of manorial documentation relating to the manors of the Bishop and Priory of Worcester and those of Guy de Beauchamp. Each section of the work contains three chapters in which an assessment is made of the evidence available for a study of settlement and colonization before proceeding to its analysis. Continuity between the sections is maintained by the production of a series of 'clearance' maps which chart the progress of settlement at the expense of woodland {{at the end of each}} of the main historical periods. The development of settlement patterns is framed within the evolution of territorial units of organisation, which allows an assessment to be made of the impact of seigniorial control as well as the influences stemming from the physical geography of the county...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} and aspatial {{aspects of the}} settlement pattern of Nottinghamshire before 1700. Two crucial problems are encountered: firstly, much of the descriptive evidence must be taken from <b>taxation</b> <b>documents</b> which do not directly refer to settlements, and secondly {{the foundations of the}} medieval settlement pattern lay in the Anglo-Scandinavian period, for which remarkably little evidence survives in Nottinghamshire. The first of these difficulties is alleviated by treating townships as functional settlements, each based on a defined territory with a system of communal agriculture. The second, however, is more intransigent. Part I begins by reconstructing the territorial structure of the county within which the settlements existed. It then analyses the Anglo-Scandinavian and Norman settlement patterns in the light of Jones' model of the multiple estate and Taylor's exemplar of the polyfocal village. Chapter Four, which is critical to the argument, reveals that throughout the period 1100 - 1 TOO the overall rank-size distribution remained convex-upwards. Nevertheless, individual places did change in relative importance, and there is also evidence for the appearance of an urban hierarcy. In spatial terms, the early dominance of the south-east of the county was replaced by a more even distribution of rural settlements and wealth. Part II seeks explanations for these changes by studying individual settlements and by examining certain specific factors. It reveals that it is extremely difficult to produce generalised models concerning settlement development, but that the role of individual landlords appears to have been of fundamental importance. The presence of a large monastic house and the growth of rural marketing were also significant factors stimulating settlement growth. In conclusion, there is a vital need to re-evaluate our theoretical and abstract views concerning the nature of medieval settlement, both by undertaking detailed field research and also by drawing comparisons with contemporary processes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Tegengren, Gunilla, 2015 : Sverige och Nordlanden. Förvaltning och nordlig expansion, 1250 - 1550. (Sweden and the Northern Provinces. Central {{and provincial}} governance, {{administration}} and territorial {{expansion in the}} north, 1250 - 1550). Ph. D. dissertation, Department of Historical Studies, University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Written in Swedish, with an English summary. Since the nineteenth century Sweden has been described in research as a kingdom on the European periphery whose development during the Middle Ages was determined by specifically national characteristics and placed it with in its European context. More recent international scholarship emphasises the common characteristics {{of the history of}} the European states. An entire system of cultural events, through the dominance of the papacy, was copied and permeated throughout kingdoms and principalities. This thesis utilizes a systemic perspective and applies the over-arching hypothesis that social developments in Sweden during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries followed the same patterns that underpinned social change and territorial expansion in other peripheries of Europe. The thesis aims to explain the state formation process through the Swedish position as a realm within the papacy. This thesis examines the hypothesis that the Swedish state formation process can be understood from the territorial management and the administrative systems used. General results are linked to Max Weber’s definition of the territorial state in which the state has a legal system with well-planned and rationally established rules for administration and taxation both in the core area, and as a method of territorial expansion. Such systems have been distinguished in the medieval sources, analyzed and explained in this study. This thesis shows that the systems for mark planning and assessment were not only used in the core area of the realm, but also as the means when the Swedish Crown annexed the northern parts of Sweden and Finland in the fourteenth century. The study is conducted on two chronological levels. The first part examines the period between 1250 and 1297 when a new legal system was prepared and finally enshrined by the king. The source material primarily consists of the Law of Uppland and diplomas. The second part examines the period between 1297 and 1550 in which the source material consists of the Laws of Uppland and Hälsingland, diplomas, land registers, and <b>taxation</b> <b>documents.</b> Based on data from the land registry, the medieval taxation in the northern provinces has been reconstructed and followed over 250 years. This thesis brings to the fore valuable knowledge of the state formation in Sweden and gives the provinces of Nordlanden a chronological history that has been unknown until now. Den svenska statsbildningen är ett omdiskuterat historiskt problem. Man har länge hävdat att förutsättningar för en svensk statsförvaltning saknades under medeltiden och blev möjlig först på Gustav Vasas tid. I den här avhandlingen undersöks statsbildningen från ett förvaltningsperspektiv och visar helt nya resultat. Folkungatiden 1250 – 1389 var en period av stark förnyelse då en centraliserad statsförvaltning byggdes upp och staten införde ett system för individuell beskattning av böndernas jord. Under denna period expanderade Sverige också mot norr och de hälsingska och bottniska landskapen anslöts till det svenska riket. Från ett förvaltningshistoriskt perspektiv var det Upplandslagen och dess administrativa ordningar som kom att ligga till grund för all senare förvaltningsutveckling i vårt land. Upplandslagen var höjdpunkten i den omvälvande politiska utvecklingsprocess som påbörjades av Birger jarl och gjorde Sverige till en territoriell monarki bland andra i medeltidens europeiska samhälle...|$|R
