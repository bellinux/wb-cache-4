5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> caution, as the metals involved {{are not always}} consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals {{tend to be less}} reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access {{into the high}} mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc to people {{with little or no}} previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained the reputation of being one of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods {{in order to ensure that}} those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> greater respect.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{roles of}} alcohol and thiamine deficiency in causing brain damage remain controversial in alcoholics without the Wernicke– Korsakoff syndrome. Experimental control over alcohol consumption and diet are impossible in humans but can be accomplished in animal models. This experiment <b>was</b> designed <b>to</b> differentiate the separate and combined effects on the macro- and ultrastructure of the corpus callosum of thiamine deficiency and voluntary alcohol consumption. Adult male alcohol-preferring (P) rats (9 chronically alcohol-exposed and 9 water controls) received a thiamine-deficient diet for 2 weeks. There were four groups: five rats previously exposed <b>to</b> alcohol <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> pyrithiamine (a thiamine phosphorylation inhibitor); five rats never exposed <b>to</b> alcohol <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> pyrithiamine; four alcohol-exposed rats <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> thiamine; and four rats never exposed <b>to</b> alcohol <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> thiamine. On day 14, thiamine was restored in all 18 rats; 2 weeks later the 10 pyrithiamine-treated rats received intraperitoneal thiamine. The rats were perfused 61 days post-pyrithiamine treatment at age 598 days. Brains were dissected and weight and volumes were calculated. Sagittal sections <b>were</b> stained <b>to</b> measure white matter structures. The corpus callosum was examined using transmission electron microscopy to determine density of myelinated fibers, fiber diameter, and myelin thickness. The corpus callosum in the alcohol/ pyrithiamine group was significantly thinner, had greater fiber density, higher percentage of small fibers, and myelin thinning than in the alcohol/thiamine and water/thiamine groups. Several measures showed a graded effect, where the alcohol/pyrithiamine group had greater pathology than the water/pyrithiamine group, which had greater pathology than the two thiamine-replete groups.

25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, {{it is possible to}} use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} changes for Revere in his new {{business}} was organization of labor. In his earlier days, Revere primarily utilized the apprenticeship model standard for artisan shops at this time, but as his business expanded he hired employees (wage laborers) to work for his foundry. Many manufacturers of the era found this transition from master to employer difficult because many employees {{at the onset of}} the Industrial Revolution identified themselves as skilled workers, and thus wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> the respect and autonomy accorded to artisans. An artisan himself, Revere managed to avoid many of these labor conflicts by adopting a system of employment that still held trappings of the craft system in the form of worker freedoms such as work hour flexibility, wages in line with skill levels, and liquor on the job.|$|E
25|$|Sax Russell devotes {{himself to}} various {{scientific}} projects, {{all the while}} continuing {{to recover from the}} effects of his stroke.

Sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from Ann, while Ann, depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses, is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments. However, when Sax witnesses Ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world, he arranges for her to be resuscitated and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> the longevity treatment, both against her will.|$|E
40|$|Out of 210 {{isolates}} of Haemophilus influenzae {{obtained from}} the sputum of 63 patients with chronic respiratory infections 109 (52 %) <b>were</b> resistant <b>to</b> trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole by the disc test.
