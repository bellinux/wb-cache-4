50|$|A <b>tetrode</b> <b>{{transistor}}</b> is any transistor having four active terminals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tetrode</b> <b>{{transistor}}</b> {{high speed}} variant of grown-junction transistor or alloy junction transistor with two connections to base.|$|E
50|$|The unijunction {{transistor}} was invented as {{a byproduct of}} research on germanium <b>tetrode</b> <b>transistors</b> at General Electric. It was patented in 1953. Commercially, silicon devices were manufactured.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tetrode</b> {{point-contact}} <b>transistor</b> – Point-contact transistor {{having two}} emitters. It became obsolete {{in the middle}} 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|The dual-gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration, {{where both}} gates control the current in the device. It is {{commonly}} used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect, replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The [...] "tetrode" [...] description, though accurate, does not replicate the vacuum-tube tetrode. Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly {{an order of magnitude}} (10 times) or considerably more. <b>Tetrode</b> <b>transistors</b> (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} types of <b>tetrode</b> <b>transistor</b> {{developed}} in the early 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later grown junction transistor and alloy junction transistor. Both offered much higher speed than earlier transistors.|$|E
50|$|Grown-junction {{transistors}} rarely operated at frequencies {{above the}} audio range, {{due to their}} relatively thick base layers. Growing thin base layers {{was very hard to}} control and welding the wire to the base became harder the thinner it got. Higher-frequency operation could be obtained by welding a second wire {{on the opposite side of}} the base, making a <b>tetrode</b> <b>transistor,</b> and using special biasing on this second base connection.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{developments}} {{included the}} grown-junction transistor (1951), the surface-barrier transistor (1953), the diffusion transistor, the <b>tetrode</b> <b>transistor,</b> and the pentode transistor. The diffused silicon 'mesa transistor' was developed at Bell in 1955 and made commercially available by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958. The spacistor [...] was {{a type of}} transistor developed in the 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later alloy junction transistor. [...] In 1953, Philco had developed the world's first high frequency surface-barrier transistor, which {{was also the first}} transistor that was suitable for high speed computers. The world's first all-transistor car radio, manufactured by Philco in 1955, used surface-barrier transistors in its circuitry design.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are high}} voltage/low current devices in {{comparison}} with <b>transistors.</b> <b>Tetrode</b> and pentode valves have very flat anode current vs. anode voltage indicating high anode output impedances. Triodes show a stronger relationship between anode voltage and anode current.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The MOS <b>tetrode</b> <b>transistor</b> is {{studied in}} this project. This device is ideally suited for high {{frequency}} and switching application. In effect {{it is the}} solid state analogy of a multigrid vacuum tube performing a very useful multigrid function. A new structure is developed for p-channel 10 ohm-cm. silicon substrate of (111) crystal orientation. This structure consists of an aluminum control gate G₁ buried in the pyrolytic SiO₂, or E-gun evaporation SiO₂, with thermal oxide for the control gate insulator. An offset gate G₂ produces another channel L₂ and causes a longer pinchoff region in the device. The drain breakdown can be maximized so as to approach bulk breakdown {{as the result of}} the redistribution of the surface field. The Miller feedback capacitance C[subscript]G 1 -D is very low, approaching values similar to those of the vacuum pentodes. This paper describes the design, artwork, pyrolytic SiO₂ and E-gun evaporation SiO₂ process. The V-I characteristics, dynamic drain resistance, capacitance, small signal equivalent circuit and large signal limitation, and drain breakdown voltage are also discussed...|$|E
