5|$|During World War II, Styer was deputy {{commander}} of the Construction Division in the Quartermaster Corps and later the Corps of Engineers.

He became deputy commanding general of the Army Service Forces in August 1943, as <b>the</b> <b>Services</b> of Supply was renamed. In this capacity he served on the Military Policy Committee, which oversaw the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School professor, {{was elected}} as the congregation's first female president. Fink called a full {{membership}} meeting in 1982 {{to decide whether}} women could lead <b>the</b> <b>services,</b> blow the shofar (the rams-horn trumpet blown on the High Holidays), and whether daughters of kohanim (hereditary priests) could give the priestly blessing. Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation decided to make <b>the</b> <b>services</b> fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions.|$|E

Examples: <b>The</b> <b>service</b> consumer must sit in the hairdresser's chair, or in the airplane seat. Correspondingly, the hairdresser or the pilot {{must be in the}} shop or plane, respectively, to deliver <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> loose coupling design principle requires delving into {{the different types}} of couplings that exist between <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumer and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract as well as <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract and <b>the</b> <b>service’s</b> implementation. Only by understanding these different types, their impact on the service-orientation can be correctly analyzed.|$|R

50|$|A service {{contract}} that contains details {{about what it}} encapsulates (e.g., the logic, implementation and the technology used to build <b>the</b> <b>service)</b> may end up being used in a particular manner by providing <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumer more knowledge about the working of <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> In <b>the</b> case of service-orientation, more knowledge is not necessarily better. There is a chance that additional information could impede the reusability of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> as <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumer designer may streamline his design based on this knowledge. However, doing so would affect the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract as now <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumer is indirectly coupled to <b>the</b> <b>service</b> implementation, which {{may need to be}} replaced in the future. This increases the consumer-to-contract type of coupling, which is a positive type of coupling. However, having too much dependence can negatively impact the evolution of both <b>the</b> <b>service</b> provider and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumer.|$|R

50|$|Although most of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> design {{principles}} {{support each}} other in a positive manner, however, in case of service abstraction and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about <b>the</b> <b>service</b> are hidden away from <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> This could be addressed by carefully recording <b>the</b> <b>service</b> meta-information so that the inner workings of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> are not documented within this meta-information.|$|R

5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> offered by {{industrial}} laundries {{were sold to}} individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} <b>the</b> <b>services,</b> and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> {{departure}} event terminates <b>the</b> <b>service</b> {{that generated}} this event.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, to {{insulate}} service logic from negative effects from changes in <b>the</b> <b>service</b> implementation, <b>the</b> <b>Service</b> Façade design pattern could be reapplied to introduce another façade component between <b>the</b> <b>service</b> implementation and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> logic. <b>The</b> application of <b>the</b> <b>Service</b> Abstraction principle can further help {{to reduce the}} possibilities of any detrimental effects caused by the application of this design pattern.|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place <b>the</b> <b>services</b> under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of this principle requires collecting information about <b>the</b> <b>service</b> during <b>the</b> <b>service</b> analysis phase as during this phase; maximum information is available about <b>the</b> <b>service’s</b> functional context and the capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> At this stage, the domain knowledge of the business experts could also be enlisted to document meta-data about <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> In <b>the</b> service-oriented design phase, the already gathered meta-data could be made part of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract. <b>The</b> OASIS SOA-RM standard specifies service description as an artifact that represents service meta-data.|$|R
50|$|The ACMA {{decided in}} closing <b>the</b> <b>service</b> {{that it was}} {{unlikely}} that datacast services would come to auction in the near future, and decided continuing the trial was unnecessary for that reason. NITV, which gained coverage on <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> considered <b>the</b> closure of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> a blow to its chances of gaining permanent spectrum for <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and put <b>the</b> long term viability of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> into question.|$|R
50|$|Service loose {{coupling}} dictates {{that this kind}} of coupling should to be favored so that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> logic is developed exclusively in support of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract. However, this requires following the 'contract first' approach as advocated by <b>the</b> standardized <b>service</b> contract principle so that <b>the</b> <b>service</b> logic is coupled to a standardized contract. This way <b>the</b> <b>service</b> contract is not coupled to the logic so the logic could be replaced in future if need be without affecting <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumers.|$|R
