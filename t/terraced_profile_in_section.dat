40|$|In this study, a variable-resolution optical {{measurement}} system (VROPMS) based on triangulation measurement technology is proposed. The VROPMS optical scanning probe {{is composed of}} dual CCD cameras fitted with zoom lenses and a line laser diode projector. A flexible and novel calibration procedure for VROPMS is developed to acquire the system parameters quickly and accurately. The central position of the reflected laser image is calculated using Gaussian function least-squares fitting of the beam intensity. Subpixel resolution can thus be acquired.

The effects of overloading were examined histologically after 7, 55 and 208 post-operative days, and also in teased preparations.

Animals studied after 55 and 208 post-operative days showed an increase in soleus muscle weight, with fibre hypertrophy (but no increase in fibre number) proximally, while distally there was {{an increase in the number}} of fibre <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> cross <b>sections,</b> some being wider, some thinner than normal.

40|$|A {{series of}} 10 cases of biliary {{obstruction}} due to primary cholangiocarcinoma {{has been studied}} with histological and immunocytochemical means. The total duration of cholestasis (as manifested by jaundice) was between 2 and 11 weeks with variable period of preoperative drainage. Liver biopsy specimens taken during surgery for cholangiocarcinoma were investigated {{for the presence of}} ductular proliferation and the development of fibrosis, as demonstrated by Sirius Red F 3 BA collagen staining. The differentiation of epithelial components was evaluated by AEC-immunostaining with chain-specific monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against human keratins type 7, 18 and 19. Keratin 7, normally occurring only in the ductular system, was expressed in hepatocytes at the periphery of the hepatic lobule (zone I) following about 4 weeks' cholestasis, when an increase of ductular <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> the enlarged portal areas had become manifest. Such keratin 7 positive cells, however, still retained all morphological aspects of hepatocytes. Keratin 19, normally also restricted to the ductular system in liver, is not expressed by zone I hepatocytes even after longer duration (up to 11 weeks) of cholestasis. It is concluded that the increase <b>in</b> ductular <b>profiles</b> during the first week is mainly due do proliferation of pre-existing ductules, while ductular metaplasia occurs in more chronic cholestasis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} culture {{environment}} on the volume density and surface density of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in a facultative yeast were studied. When compared with cells grown aerobically on a nonrepressive substrate, cells {{grown in the}} absence of oxygen showed a sharp reduction in both volume density of mitochondria and surface density of the inner mitochondrial membrane (imm) in the remaining mitochondrial profiles. Use of fermentable (repressive) substrates under aerobic conditions restricted the volume density of mitochondria to a much greater extent than the surface density of imm. The range of mitochondrial volume densities in these experiments was 4 - 11 %. Surface density of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was sensitive to growth rate and in particular to changes in oxygen tension, showing large fluctuations during both anaerobic and aerobic adaptation. These fluctuations in ER are discussed in relation to the known role of this organelle in lipid metabolism. The effects of culture environment on tile structure and function of mitochondria from facultative yeast have been studied extensively (18, 19, 26, 29).

30|$|As {{motivated}} <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> ‘Introduction’, for {{the evaluation}} and optimization of the LD power consumption a realistic functional model is needed which maps the modem’s TP to its LD power consumption. An empirical model based on power measurements of a class-AB LD in ADSL 2 + was presented in[2]. However, this model is not applicable to other DSL technologies or systems with different physical parameters. A circuit-level model for an LD of class-AB and G with two supplies has been presented in[4], based on the models in[26]. However, these models do not precisely account for the non-idealities of the voltage supply chain[27] (e.g., transformer loss, impedance synthesize factor, etc.) and the power loss in the hybrid circuit. Therefore, <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> ‘Class-AB line-driver power model’, we derive an enhanced class-AB LD power consumption model based on[26] {{that can be applied}} to any DSL <b>profile,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> ‘Class-G line-driver power model’, we propose a novel model for a class-G LD with charge pumps.|$|R
