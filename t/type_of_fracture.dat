25|$|Bennett {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{of the base}} of the first metacarpal bone which extends into the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. This intra-articular fracture is the most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> of the thumb, and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of subluxation or frank dislocation of the carpometacarpal joint.|$|E
25|$|Though these {{fractures}} commonly appear quite subtle or even inconsequential on radiographs, {{they can}} result in severe long-term dysfunction of the hand if left untreated. In his original description of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> in 1882, Bennett {{stressed the need for}} early diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent loss of function of the thumb CMC joint, which is critical to the overall function of the hand.|$|E
25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in a {{direction}} that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper.|$|E
40|$|We report two similar rare <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> {{the lower}} end of the humerus {{sustained}} in fit young adults while throwing a ball. Both cases were seen within 1 week in a busy accident and emergency (A&E) department. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> in each case are unusual and, in the past, have been attributed to fatigue or to a repetitive strain pattern...|$|R

30|$|It was {{possible}} {{to show that the}} exposure time and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> classified as Gustilo III and Tscherne II and III are associated with the outcome of infection. It was also possible to create a risk score (IRS) for predicting infection in these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures,</b> which can be used in the initial care of the patient, with a sensitivity of 0.840, specificity of 0.544, cut-off of 6.5 and area under the curve of 0.709 (p =  0.002).|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of the data was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 11.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was used to evaluate any potential association of complication rates with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures.</b> Odd ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, by means of simple logistic regression analysis, as the measure of association between complications and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures.</b> All tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance was considered for P values <  0.05.|$|R
30|$|Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> {{may occur}} {{due to the}} anatomy of the distal radius {{and the effects of}} forces in {{different}} directions. It is often not possible to have a successful outcome using the same approach and materials for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures.</b> While mechanical characteristics are important in fixation selection, the strategic placement of the selected materials may in fact be more important than the characteristics of these materials, particularly in intra-articular fractures [17]. The best treatment option for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> may be determined by comparing different methods. External fixation is versatile in managing both intra- and extra-articular fractures with acceptable functional results. Reasons for using external fixation include the continuity of reduction under fluoroscopic control, improved reduction by ligamentotaxis, and the ability to protect the reduction until healing occurs. The advantages of external fixation are the relative ease of application, minimal surgical exposure, and reduced surgical trauma [10].|$|R
