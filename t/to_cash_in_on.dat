5|$|Dirty Duck {{received}} mostly negative reviews, {{with many}} criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing {{the film as}} an attempt <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat.

5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the Republican {{candidate}} for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his life insurance.|$|E

50|$|Pulp {{novels in}} the 1950s were mass-produced <b>to</b> {{specifically}} <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the growing fear of youth that was spreading throughout society.

Hari Venkateswara Pictures acquired the film's overseas distribution rights and after requests by non-Telugu Mahesh fans, {{it was the}} first Telugu film to release with subtitles in overseas cinemas. The makers planned for a release in new international markets like Japan and Dubai <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Mahesh's previous film, Dookudu. The release was postponed by two days to 13 January 2012 due to post production delays. Two thousand screens across the world were booked for the film's initial release.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did {{not sit well with}} the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E

5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also because they wanted <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|The filming was {{supposed}} to begin in August 2009. However, due to the slow progress of Karthi's ongoing project, Aayirathil Oruvan, Paiyaa was postponed several times, since Karthi needed to maintain the continuity of his looks {{for his role in}} Aayirathil Oruvan. Its producer Ravindran complained at the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments, which forced Linguswamy to readjust the schedules. The shooting finally began in December 2008. The film's music was released in November 2009 along with the trailer. In late 2009, after finishing the filming of Paiyaa, Lingusamy disclosed his plans of remaking the film in Telugu and Hindi as well. Later, as Yuganikki Okkadu, the Telugu dubbed version of Karthi's Aayirathil Oruvan, emerged as successful in Andhra Pradesh, the team instead decided to dub and release the film in Telugu <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Karthi's new-found popularity in the state. The Telugu version was titled Awara and its audio was released in March 2010; Awara was released simultaneously with the Tamil version. In March 2010, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Dhayanidhi Alagiri's Cloud Nine Movies.|$|E

Its stock price, which had peaked at $10, had fallen as low as 14 cents. The company went private in December 2001.|$|R
5000|$|In 1870, Sanford paid $18,400 {{to former}} Confederate General Joseph Finegan to acquire his {{extensive}} land holdings along Lake Monroe and founded {{the city of}} Sanford, Florida. [...] He founded an orange plantation at Lake Monroe that offered some promise to revive his flagging fortunes, {{but it did not}} prove profitable in the long term. In fact he poured quite a bit of precious capital into land speculation and town building in Florida in the hopes of turning around a family economy that spent far more than it took in, but with no success. The commitment of his time and resources <b>to</b> <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the postbellum Florida land boom was a miserable failure in the end. His wife was so disgruntled with his booster schemes that she lamented in a letter to her husband that Florida was [...] "a vampire that... sucked the repose & the beauty & the dignity & cheerfulness out of our lives." [...] Sanford had numerous other business interests, some in the Congo after his work for Belgium, but none were profitable.|$|R

25|$|When the F40 was {{revealed}} in 1987 it received mixed reactions. Dennis Simanaitis praised its looks in Road & Track, but others were unimpressed. Observers considered it as a cynical attempt <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> speculators money after seeing {{how much was}} paid for used 288 GTOs and the high demand for the Porsche 959. Speculators were expecting Enzo Ferrari's death and to benefit from raising prices.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, Julius joined Martin Denny's band {{where he}} played marimba (replacing Arthur Lyman) as well as {{numerous}} other percussion instruments. Four years later he was paid $15 as a session man on Herb Alpert's debut album, The Lonely Bull. Wechter soon composed [...] "Spanish Flea" [...] for Alpert, which became a hit for him.

25|$|As mopane worms {{represent}} an important {{sector in the}} local rural economy, they attract {{large numbers of people}} who seek <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the profits from selling the insects as food.

In some areas, farmers and communities have taken steps to reach a balance, so that each year may yield maximum returns without compromising the following year's harvest.|$|E
25|$|Santander opted <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Benayoun {{by selling}} {{him to his}} agents Pini Zahavi and Ronen Katsav for €3.5 million.

25|$|In 1919, John Kenworthy, chief {{designer}} of the motor manufacturer Austin Motor Company, (who had built large numbers of aircraft under license during the First World War) designed a small single-seater light aircraft in order <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> an expected boom in private flying. The resulting aircraft, named the Austin Whippet, was a small single-seat biplane of mixed construction, with a fabric covered steel tube fuselage, and single-bay, folding wooden wings.

5000|$|After {{the series}} ended, two direct-to-DVD movies were produced: Kong: King of Atlantis, {{released}} in 2005 and Kong: Return to the Jungle, released in 2007.

5000|$|The {{owners of}} CIW {{state that the}} {{education}} they provide is [...] "vendor neutral," [...] because no one specific vendor is profiled. The idea is that instead of teaching specific applications, the program teaches more important skills. However, CIW's relevance has come under question in some circles. Because CIW was created during the [...] "dot com" [...] period, it and other certifications like it have fallen under criticism that they were created <b>to</b> simply <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> IT certification. Nevertheless, CIW seems to have survived the dot com bust and various critiques to become the world's largest Web education certification program. Over 145,000 CIW certifications have been issued since 1997. This number represents roughly 120,000 individuals worldwide.|$|R

25|$|Blackjack and Poker Royale {{signified}} {{the beginnings}} of GSN's attempts <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the TV poker craze at the time.

One {{of the most popular}} shows from the initial TV poker boom, the World Poker Tour, was slated to move from the Travel Channel to GSN on March 24, 2008. Within a year of GSN's revamp, it began returning its focus primarily to studio-based game shows.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{description}} of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but {{at a time when}} lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice may not have understood its imagery. Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the book's reputation by raising the price from fifteen to fifty cents and pocketing the difference. Twenty years later she used him as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in Nightwood, caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.|$|E

5|$|Not {{wanting a}} tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and {{attacked}} Laurinaitis.

When Del Rio ran out and tried <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a roundhouse kick on Del Rio before he could do so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.|$|R
5|$|On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler {{defeated}} Alex Riley {{to qualify}} for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> the briefcase <b>on</b> Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from <b>cashing</b> <b>in.</b> <b>On</b> the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> the briefcase <b>on</b> Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> his Money <b>in</b> the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him <b>in</b> a rematch <b>on</b> Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|R
