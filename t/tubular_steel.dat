5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> furniture.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear {{analysis}} of the steady-state load-bearing capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> and the steady-state load-bearing capacity of scaffold was simulated by ANSYS considering semi-rigid connection and pole in different flat. Quantitative standard of the steady-state load-bearing capacity to the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> and the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is used in ANSYS. The effect of semi-rigid connection on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is great. The effect of pole in different flat on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is smaller. It’s generally recognized that nodes of vertical bars and horizontal bars of <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold by fasteners is not rigid, but semi-rigid; {{is not in the}} same plane, but in a different surface.

25|$|The N-1M {{was one of}} a {{progression}} of experimental aircraft that further developed Northrop's all-wing concept. The aircraft was produced in the United States and was developed during 1939 and 1940 as a flying testbed for the purpose of proving Jack Northrop's vision of a practical Flying Wing. Built mostly of specially laminated layers of glued wood, the design of both wooden wings allowed for easy configuration changes with the central blended fuselage, which was made of <b>tubular</b> <b>steel.</b> The diminutive, twin-engine test aircraft served its purpose well, first taking to the skies on 3 July 1941 at Baker Dry Lake in California.|$|E

25|$|A fairly recent {{class of}} firearms, purpose-designed {{insurgency}} weapons first appeared during World War II, {{in the form}} of such arms as the FP-45 Liberator and the Sten submachine gun. Designed to be inexpensive, since they were to be airdropped or smuggled behind enemy lines, insurgency weapons were designed for use by guerrilla and insurgent groups. Most insurgency weapons are of simple design, typically made of sheet steel stampings, which are then folded into shape and welded. <b>Tubular</b> <b>steel</b> in standard sizes is also used when possible, and barrels (one of the few firearm parts that requires fine tolerances and high strength) may be rifled (like the Sten) or left smoothbore (like the FP-45).|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> skeleton stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{design for}} the {{renovation}} project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it. Unfortunately {{it was discovered that}} the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate {{design for the}} support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.|$|E

In {{order to}} provide {{scientific}} basis for design and application of cast steel joint, this paper researches on mechanical properties of tubular-plate combined cast <b>steel</b> joint and <b>tubular</b> cast <b>steel</b> joint, which work in International Expo Center in the most unfavorable load condition. Finite Element Method (FEM) is employed to analysis the mechanical properties of the complex cast steel joint and an optimize solution is given. FEM based on large deformation theory and material nonlinearity obtained ultimate load and failure mode of the joints. The results show that, force transmission path of combined cast steel joint is complex for its cross-section shape of branch changes much; stress concentration is very obvious on the branch. In contrast, the force transmission path of <b>tubular</b> cast <b>steel</b> joint is clear and concise; the phenomenon of stress concentration alleviated effectively, the efficiency of material improved greatly; in {{the same amount of}} material, the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>tubular</b> cast <b>steel</b> joint increased by 9. 5 %.

25|$|The {{modified}} aircraft {{known as}} the Douglas World Cruiser (DWC), powered by a 420hp Liberty L-12 engine, also {{was the first major}} project at Douglas for Jack Northrop. Northrop designed the fuel system for the series. The conversion involved incorporating a total of six fuel tanks in wings and fuselage. For greater range, the total fuel capacity went from 115 gallons (435 liters) to 644 gallons (2,438 liters). Other changes from the DT involved having increased cooling capacity, as well as adding two separate tanks for oil and water. To ensure a more robust structure, a <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> fuselage, strengthened bracing, a modified wing of 49ft (15 m) wingspan and larger rudder were required. The dual cockpits for the pilot and copilot/crewman were also located more closely together with a cutout in the upper wing to increase visibility.|$|E
