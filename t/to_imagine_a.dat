5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 would be hard-pressed <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever {{come back from the}} total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

25|$|Acousticians, in {{studying}} the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived.

25|$|In May 1873, {{with the}} Third Anglo-Ashanti War brewing, he met Wolseley by {{chance in the}} War Office and joked that his naval {{experience}} might come in handy for West African waterways. On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley’s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it would be difficult <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.|$|E

25|$|The {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, {{published}} in Chūōkōron in September 1926. The film opens {{as an artist and}} a young woman are in a dentist's waiting room. Though he is attracted to the woman, he says nothing to her. They are later in the same examining room. When the artist is given an anaesthetic, he begins <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> series of scenes in which the woman undergoes various forms of sexual abuse at the hand of the dentist, including rape and torture. When the artist recovers from the anaesthetic, he finds bite marks on the woman's breast, indicating that he may not have been hallucinating.|$|E
25|$|It is easy <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> {{biological}} {{system where}} some components are complex multi-state molecules, whereas others have few possible states (or even just one) and exist in large numbers. A hybrid {{approach has been}} proposed to model such systems: Within the Hybrid Particle/Population (HPP) framework, the user can specify a rule-based model, but can designate some species {{to be treated as}} populations (rather than particles) in the subsequent simulation. This method combines the computational advantages of particle-based modeling for multi-state systems with relatively low molecule numbers and of population-based modeling for systems with high molecule numbers and a small number of possible states. Specification of HPP models is supported by BioNetGen, and simulations can be performed with NFSim.|$|E
25|$|Another famous thought reader was {{the magician}} Stuart Cumberland. He {{was famous for}} {{performing}} blindfolded feats such as identifying a hidden object {{in a room that}} a person had picked out or asking someone <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading.|$|E

That same night at the same place Ji Jia-wei gets rejected when he proposes marriage to his celebrity girlfriend He Zhi-yu, who cares more about her career than him. Heartbroken, Jia-wei gives the engagement ring to a drunk Xiao-tong. A year later Xiao-tong and Jia-wei meet again in the most unpleasant circumstances and become instant enemies when his umbrella accidentally splashes puddle water on her. She becomes annoyed with his unapologetic behavior while he thinks she should have been more observant of her surroundings. Their hatred for each other grows when they find out that they're in the opposite business of love. She's a Love Doctor that helps people find love at a matchmaking service while he's the boss and owner of a divorce firm that helps couples walk away from their broken marriages amicably.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{in males}} {{is much more}} likely to be elicited by the threat of sexual infidelity in a female partner, in comparison to emotional involvement outside the mateship. This is primarily due to the risk female infidelity poses for male paternity, or 'genetic cuckoldry'. In other words, as fertilisation takes place within females, males do not have paternal certainty in the way that females do (females can always be certain that the offspring is theirs, whilst a male cannot). There is supporting evidence for this cross-culturally in a varied range of countries such as China, Germany, Japan and Sweden. Moreover, in physiological tests such as skin conductance and heart rate, men show greater levels of distress when asked <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> partner having sexual intercourse with another person. It is also worth noting that mate guarding tactics are more likely to be used if the partner is of high reproductive value e.g. if the female displays signs of high fertility such as youth and physical attractiveness.|$|E

500|$|In Old English, sib ("family") is cognate with Old Norse Sif and sif.

Various scholars beginning with Magnus Olsen have pointed to the similarity with what Sif does at the feast described in Lokasenna.
