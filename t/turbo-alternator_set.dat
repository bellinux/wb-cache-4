40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] PU for CHE, 1999. Lethabo Power Station burns {{a unique}} low grade coal with low {{volatile}} content. This merits the optimisation {{of the total}} combustion air quantity with efficiency as main criterion to produce an air flowsteam flow curve {{as a function of}} load as well as coal quality. This project demonstrates the optimisation exercise of the unit as a whole, including the boiler as well as the turbine (a 600 MW <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>set),</b> therefore producing optimum air flow quantities different to the conventional wisdom. Ninety tests were performed with varying total air flow, at five loads ranging from full load to lowest load with three different coal qualities. The application of the Station Thermal Efficiency Program (STEP) as optimising tool employs a simultaneous direct and indirect calculation method (opposed to the traditional indirect only methods and programs). The test results were used to customise the targets of the STEP program for Lethabo as well as to introduce new philosophies in the formulae. The expected trend of higher unit efficiencies with resulting improved total emissions were confirmed. In the process operational enhancements such as new milling plant settings and sootblowing philosophies were also confirmed to contribute to the improved efficiencies. The findings were operationally implemented which included statutory procedurisation. Doctora...|$|E
50|$|The Wolf Creek and Callaway plants {{each have}} single half speed, 1,800 RPM (60 Hz), steam {{turbine-alternator}} sets which use the steam produced {{from the heat}} generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200 MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60 Hz. Such large <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets</b> were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets,</b> Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000 RPM (50 Hz), nominal 660 MW <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets</b> {{similar to those used}} at Drax coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs Heysham 2, but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.|$|R
2500|$|Like the [...] "A" [...] station, its {{turbines}} {{were built}} by C.A. Parsons & Company {{and it has}} two 600 MWe <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets,</b> producing a maximum output of 1200 MWe, though net output is 1090 MWe after the effects of house load, and downrating the reactor output due to corrosion and vibration concerns.|$|R
50|$|The Stafford works made {{thousands}} of Covenanter Centaur Cromwell tanks {{as well as}} precision instruments for aircraft, electric propulsion and electrical equipment.The Rugby works made Diesel engines for ships, submarines and locomotives, steam turbines for ships and <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets</b> for power stations.Bradford made electric generators for ships' auxiliaries and {{a wide variety of}} other naval and aviation material.|$|R
5000|$|Machinery and {{auxiliary}} room: This {{is where}} all of the power station’s more qualified personnel were found since, and without underestimating the workers who suffered most, {{there is a huge}} difference between setting a boiler in motion and controlling the <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets,</b> the electric power generators and all the auxiliary equipment. Approximately 15 people worked here during the day, from technical engineers, machinists and the staff responsible for the water purification process, to cleaning and maintenance personnel.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} output {{from the two}} new AEG <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets</b> installed in 1934, {{it was necessary to}} install new boilers that would operate with high pressure steam. Construction was carried out on property previously occupied by the original Tejo Power Station, which was demolished in 1938 to make way for construction of this new high pressure boiler building, the facility’s most impressive structure. Inside, it housed three large Babcock & Wilcox high pressure boilers, which began operating in 1941.|$|R
50|$|The {{installation}} of new generating sets with greater capacity made it almost mandatory {{to set up}} the first high pressure boilers (numbers 12, 13 and 14) in order to utilise the capacity provided by the <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets</b> more efficiently due to the greater power the steam from the new boilers produced. The boilers were once again ordered from manufacturer Babcock & Wilcox, and their large size dictated the construction of the largest building in the industrial complex, the High Pressure Boiler Building.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{produced}} in the boilers travelled at great pressure (38 kg/cm²) to the <b>turbo-alternator</b> <b>sets,</b> which transformed the steam’s thermal energy into mechanical energy through the turbine, which in turn transformed it into electric energy upon exiting the alternator. The generating sets were composed of a turbine and an alternator, thus the name turbo-alternator. The turbine had eight wheels with two crowns with blades, and the other seven only one crown. The steam coming from the boilers entered the turbine’s distribution box through the admission valve. From the box, with the aperture controlled by the nozzles’ valves and by undergoing the Venturi effect, the steam entered the first wheel with a high enough flow rate to get the turbine to 3000 rpm. The steam’s pressure gradually decreased in the next wheels until it equalled the condenser’s pressure, although its exchange speed remained constant.|$|R
