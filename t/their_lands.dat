5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns.

5|$|During the 1790s, towns near St. Louis {{expanded}} {{as small}} farmers sold <b>their</b> <b>lands</b> to the Cerres, Gratiots, Soulards, or Chouteaus.

5|$|Historically, {{there was}} a Native American village in the {{vicinity}} of Nescopeck Mountain, where the borough of Nescopeck is in modern times.

5|$|Munro issued three edicts {{regarding}} Christian estates {{that had}} {{been taken over by}} non-Christians during the captivity. In determining ownership of land, he sent two Mangalorean Hindus, Muthsuddy Vencappah and Saly Purvoe Dur Shetty along with other Christians to investigate and report back to him about these estates.

5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country.

The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E

5|$|Historian Alan Machado Prabhu {{mentions}} that only 11,000 survived the captivity as Christians.

According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them returned to Mangalore and its vicinity, while 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1883) {{mentions that}} 15,000 persons returned, of which 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara. According to genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely from this small group of survivors.|$|E

25|$|Governmental {{intervention}} can aid {{in encouraging}} private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on <b>their</b> <b>land.</b> The United States' Endangered Species Act requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> {{which is a}} disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on <b>their</b> <b>land</b> in the first place. To help mediate this problem, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on <b>their</b> <b>land</b> to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.
