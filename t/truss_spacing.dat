Fifteen full-scale fire resistance floor experiments were conducted using the CAN/ULC S- 101 fire resistance standard {{which is similar to}} the ASTM E 119. Parameters investigated in this study include the effects of insulation installation in floor cavity, insulation type, wood <b>truss</b> <b>spacing,</b> resilient channel installation, resilient channel spacing, wood truss width, wood truss chord orientation, wood truss web type, wood truss connection type and adding concrete topping above the sub-floor.

40|$|Typical North American wood frame {{houses have}} trusses that are toe-nailed {{to the wall}} top-plates. In order to develop models of roof {{failures}} for such structures, considering the effects of wind speed, direction and duration for a storm, {{as well as the}} structural details, knowledge of the load sharing and how it is altered by the nail slip at each of the connections is required. The objective of the current paper is to quantify the changes in load sharing during nail/connection slip. This is achieved by simplifying the roof structure to the essential components of a beam, which bends elastically in the direction normal to the trusses, and real, toe-nailed connections. Test results for a single "roof stiffness" and <b>truss</b> <b>spacing</b> show that significant load sharing is not observed until permanent displacements (i. e., damage) to a connection occur. Dynamic load tests, with the same time-varying load applied to each connection, have shown that the load sharing increases with the damage accumulation to each of the connections and changes continuously. Ultimately, this information will be used in the development of analytical models that are able to consider storm duration effects on the performance and failure of wood-frame houses in extreme winds...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} principally {{concerned}} with the shape formation of different forms of <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> with non-zero Gaussian curvature {{by means of a}} post-tensioning technique. The <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> that is shaped and erected by a post-tensioning procedure, rather than by traditional techniques involving cranes and scaffolding, is called a post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss.</b> The construction procedure for a post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> initially involves the assembly of a planar truss with a single-layer of chords, together with out-of-plane web members, at ground level. In proportion to the desired space shape, certain bottom chords are given gaps. The bottom chords comprise shorter tubes and strands that pass through the tubes and through the bottom joints. The initially too-short chords are used to create pre-defined gaps, while the tensioning strands are used to close the gaps. By means of post-tensioning, a planar layout can be deformed and erected to its desired space shape at the same time. In this thesis, the principles of the post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>trusses,</b> together with the essential aspects that lead to shape formation and self-erection, are investigated theoretically and are verified by experimental models. In addition to theoretical work, seven domes and one hypar have been constructed by means of a post-tensioning method under laboratory conditions. Also, a pyramidal unit of a full-size practical <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> has been tested. After the shape formation tests, three post-tensioned and shaped domes and one hypar <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> have been loaded to failure in order to observe the ultimate load carrying capacity. The post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> have satisfactory ultimate load capacity. The post-tensioning process m a y increase or reduce the ultimate load capacity of posttensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>trusses,</b> due to the resulted prestress forces in some critical members. Compared with the simplicity in construction and erection procedure, the post-tensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>trusses</b> still have evident advantages in economy, even if the ultimate load capacity is reduced. Furthermore, the ultimate load capacity of a posttensioned and shaped <b>space</b> <b>truss</b> can be improved by stiffening only a few critical members according to the test results...|$|R
40|$|Wind is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that occurs in all regions and can be predicted. But nowadays, Malaysia experienced an extreme climate change and unexpected wind condition which is lead to severe damage to the building especially residential building and this case had increase in past few years. As this problem is forecasted {{to lead to the}} great amount of losses in term of money and can cause injuries to people, this paper is provide to study the characteristic of wind and to determine the maximum wind speed that can cause failure to roof, and hence provide theguideline of the safety design of roof truss for residential building. The research is focuses on standard roof trusses design of residential building with JKR standard as a guideline. As referring to the postdisaster investigation of major windstorm events that had been conducted in Unites States for past two decades prove that the failure of the roof structure is obviously because of the poor construction of the truss system and due to the construction itself that not following code. Based on the past research also shown that the presence of wind load in term of suction and uplift force that normally ignored in construction is the main cause of roof system to fail. The research is proceed by using data of various wind speed that lead to different potential damage to the building which is Fujita Scale and Tamura Scale. Basic wind speed of 33. 5 m/s is set up as a benchmark in determining the standard size of the truss and the dimension of the truss itself. The value of wind speed from Tamura Scale is used in analysing the loading on the roof truss by using simplified procedure in MS 1553 : 2002 since the cases is investigated in Malaysia. The methodology of the research then projected by create a model of roof trusses in ANSYS.

At the end of the research, it found that the minimum size of truss that can support basic wind speed 33. 5 mIs is 75 x 75 x 8 and truss to fail when reach wind speed 140 mls when considering wind tunnel coefficient and 1 60 m/s without considering wind tunnel coefficient. As a nutshell, this can be conclude that in designing for roof trusses, the value of wind speed that should be considered in the design is not only focusing on basic wind speed but also increase the design capacity of the trusses so that when unexpected high wind speed occur, the roof truss still can support the load without any failure...|$|E

With the availability of PC-based packages that are able to perform three-dimensional buckling analyses, it is perhaps useful to investigate the validity of using the effective length equal to the <b>truss</b> <b>spacing,</b> and then also the 10 m limit on span for roofs braced by means of diagonal braces. A common error made when analysing three-dimensional buckling problems is to assume connectivity on the centreline of the members, thereby neglecting eccentricity between the centreline of the bracing and the centreline of the member being braced (see Figure 1). In timber-trussed roofs, the diagonal brace is nailed to the underside of the top chord of a number of adjacent trusses. The brace runs at more or less 45 Â° and triangulation appears to be complete when viewed on plan, as the battens form the other elements of the bracing system triangulation. Trusses some distance from the trusses that are connected to the diagonal brace can, however, only obtain lateral support via the battens that are connected {{to the top of the}} compression chords. The authors feel that a more correct way of analysing a timber-trussed roof, braced by means of a diagonal brace, requires that the eccentricity between the centreline of the battens on top of the compression chords and the centreline of the braced points on the underside of the compression chords be taken into account. Furthermore, the connections between the battens and the top chord are not infinitely stiff and this stiffness, together with the low torsional rigidity of the timber members, should be taken into account in the buckling analysis. The analysis can be further improved by taking the out-of-plane bending stiffness of the web members into account. All these factors will influence the buckling length of the compression chords to some degree. In this paper, the authors show how incorrect assumptions may mislead the designer into believing that the buckling length is equal to or less than the spacing of the trusses. They also show that, even though the bracing members have been placed on the correct sides of the top chord in the analysis, incorrect assumptions about the torsional stiffness of the top chords can lead to buckling lengths that are slightly less than when a more realistic torsional stiffness is used...|$|E
