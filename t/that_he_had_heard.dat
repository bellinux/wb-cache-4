5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{moved to}} Beauchamp, {{as he was}} loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his {{political}} principles. People knew of Sharp's earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. Witnesses placed Beauchamp in Frankfort {{the night of the}} killing, and his host, Joel Scott, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Beauchamp leave the house during the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{and other}} {{officers}} meet with psychiatrist Dr. Kress at a restaurant, where {{he explains that}} the Phantom is a highly intelligent sadist with a strong sex drive, {{between the ages of}} 35 and 40. As Kress expresses his doubts about their chances of capturing the Phantom, the Phantom's shoes are shown, revealing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the entire conversation. At the station, a man named Johnson says that he was robbed and forced to drive a man to Lufkin at gunpoint. While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues. The suspect, Eddie LeDoux, at first denies everything, then confesses to being the Phantom, but Morales is unconvinced. Johnson identifies him as his robber.|$|E
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> {{no mention of the}} alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 2017, {{after the}} 1–1 Ligue 1 away draw against SC Bastia, Balotelli claimed on Instagram {{that he was}} a victim of racist abuse when fans of the Corsican club {{allegedly}} made monkey noises directed at him during the match and just {{prior to the start of}} the match. On the following day, Alassane Pléa (Balotelli's Nice teammate) confirmed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the monkey noises directed at Balotelli. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) announced an investigation into Balotelli's allegations. On 18 February 2017, Balotelli was sent off once again, in his fourteenth Ligue 1 appearance, a 1–0 win at Lorient; he received a straight red card in the second half for insulting referee Tony Chapron in English. He was given a two-match ban (the second match was a suspended ban that would be triggered in the event of any further misconduct by Balotelli) by the Ligue 1’s disciplinary committee on 23 February.|$|E

5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E

[...] Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins.|$|R
25|$|In 1970 a young police recruit {{reported}} {{to a senior}} officer <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> gossip from colleagues about the severe way Kitching and Ellerker had treated Oluwale. This report might have been prompted by fraud charges that were on-going against Ellerker. An enquiry was launched, carried out by Scotland Yard, and sufficient evidence was gathered to prompt manslaughter, perjury and grievous bodily harm (GBH) charges being brought against Kitching and Ellerker in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Since Mahler himself never {{conducted}} the Ninth Symphony and Das Lied von der Erde, Walter's performances cannot {{be taken as}} documentations of Mahler's interpretations. However, {{in the light of}} Walter's personal connection with the composer and his having given the original performances, they have another kind of primary authenticity. In his other (greatly esteemed) recordings of Mahler—various songs and the First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Symphonies—there is the great added interest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Mahler's own performances of most of them.|$|E
25|$|In early 1955, Lewis warned Culshaw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rumours that Capitol was on {{the point}} of {{severing}} its ties with Decca. Within days it was announced that Capitol had been taken over by EMI. Capitol sessions already booked were completed, including two records of Jacques Ibert conducting his own works, but EMI made it clear that it would put an end to Capitol's classical activity, which was regarded as superfluous. Lewis invited Culshaw to rejoin Decca, which he did in the autumn of 1955.|$|E
