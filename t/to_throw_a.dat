5|$|Pennock {{made his}} major league debut with the Athletics during the 1912 season on May 14, {{allowing}} one hit in four innings pitched. He {{was the youngest}} person {{to play in the}} American League (AL) that season. Former major leaguer Mike Grady, a neighbor of Pennock's in Kennett Square, took Pennock under his wing, while Bender taught Pennock <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> screwball.|$|E
5|$|The Mets added deGrom {{to their}} 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, {{to protect him}} from being {{eligible}} in the Rule 5 draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, and learned <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> curveball. He began the 2014 season with Las Vegas, and had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 2.58 ERA in his first seven games started.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts {{decided to create}} trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E

Finn makes a Paper Crane for Bubblegum as a gift, but Jake says that Finn has a crush on her, which Finn denies. When they arrive at the party, however, no one notices them; everyone, {{including}} Bubblegum, is too preoccupied with a heart-shaped man named Ricardio. He and Bubblegum begin discussing scientific topics on the dance floor, which leaves Finn feeling jealous.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> contest, {{there was a}} very good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E

5|$|Cueto walked Murphy {{with two}} outs in the ninth before getting Cespedes to fly out to right to finish the {{complete}} game, becoming the first AL pitcher to accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series. Cueto became the first AL pitcher since Jim Lonborg in the 1967 World Series <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> World Series complete game while allowing two hits or fewer.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E

Feeling pity for Kenneth, Tracy tells the biggest gossips on TGS with Tracy Jordan, Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown), that T.I. will be attending. They persuade other people to attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> party again.|$|E

5|$|On May 25, 2014, Beckett {{pitched a}} no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the 21st no-hitter in Dodgers history, {{and the first}} since Hideo Nomo did so in the 1996 season. He threw 128 pitches, struck out six, and walked three {{en route to the}} victory. Beckett also became the oldest pitcher (34) <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> no hitter since Randy Johnson (40) threw a perfect game in 2004. He was honored as the National League Player of the Week {{as a result of that}} game.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> perfect game, the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most recorded in a perfect game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{game in the}} 2004 {{season in}} which Favre and the Packers {{finished}} 10–6 was against the New York Giants. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had two significant touchdown streaks of note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E

5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E

During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
