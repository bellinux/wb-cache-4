It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten {{what it felt like to}} have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
60|$|That's what you've been {{brooding}} over <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> is it? Separation! I {{knew there}} was something, and I couldn't {{find out what it}} was.|$|E
60|$|SHE. Poor dear Georgina! I'm sorry I haven't {{been able}} to call on her <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> I hope there's nothing the matter with her.|$|E
6000|$|I, THE {{man with}} the red scarf, [...] Will give thee what I have, <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week's</b> earn- [...] ings. Take them, and buy thee a silver ring [...] And wed me, to ease my yearnings.|$|R
60|$|We had rhubarb pies for {{the first}} time <b>this</b> spring <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> They were fine but hard on the cream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, rely on it, {{there is}} no sham here; Charley Pray told me of <b>this</b> girl <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> when {{no one had ever}} heard of her pocket-handkerchief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{be as good}} as your word, {{and take}} her yourself. I've watched you <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and you'll make her a good husband. There, I have spoken; let me hear no more about it." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then her}} mother entered the room, and candles were brought. Lady Desmond was all smiles and benignity, {{as she had}} been for <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> past, while Herbert Fitzgerald had been coming and going almost daily at Desmond Court. But Clara {{understood}} this benignity, and disliked it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It cannot {{have been}} that, sir, for {{we were out}} in quite as rough a sea as <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and the {{bowsprit}} would have gone then if this cut had been there. Besides, {{we should have been}} sure to have noticed it when we went round her to polish up her sides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was a {{handsome}} lad <b>this</b> time <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> with naturally curly hair," [...] remarked the lady. She spoke with a rising inflection, suggestive {{of the beginning of}} things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say {{the coffee}} {{is going to}} poison him," [...] burst out Tom. [...] "I was reading about poison getting into the coffee at <b>this</b> hotel <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> But, of course--" ...|$|R
50|$|In October 2012, the {{deadline}} for the Thames Tideway Tunnels' Section 48 closed. <b>This</b> <b>lasted</b> 12 <b>weeks</b> and was the last opportunity {{for the public to}} have their say on the updated proposal.|$|R
60|$|To-day I leave Mrs. Brown's lodgings. Altogether I cannot complain, but {{the insects}} were voracious, even until {{last night when}} the turtle-soup and {{champagne}} ought to have made me sleep like a top. But I have done a monstrous sight of work here notwithstanding the indolence of <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> which must and shall be amended.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as three}} days' repose on the Atlantic steamer made me, in my altered appearance, the amazement of the captain, so <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> has set me up, thank God, {{in the most}} {{wonderful}} manner. The sense of exhaustion seems a dream already. Of course I shall train myself carefully, nevertheless, all through the summer and autumn.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, he {{has been}} doing so much," [...] said Busy Bee. [...] "It is only for <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> he has gone to bed at all, and then only on the sofa in Fred's room. This {{is the first time}} {{he has been}} out, except last Sunday to Church, and a turn or two round the garden with grandmamma." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>this</b> day <b>last</b> <b>week</b> I knew no {{more that}} I could {{do things like}} that than you did. It came quite sudden. It's {{something}} odd about my will, I suppose, and that's as far as I can see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Success, Brother!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Burge, eating {{rapidly and}} gesticulating with his knife. [...] "Success ain’t no name for it. Why, since <b>this</b> day <b>last</b> <b>week</b> he has saved three pick-pockets, two Salvationists, one bigamist and a Roman Catholic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said, [...] "I am superstitious. <b>This</b> is my <b>last</b> <b>week</b> at the 'Unusual,' you know. We begin rehearsing on Monday at the 'Garrick'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He may do that," [...] Phipps acknowledged. [...] "I've {{given him}} cause to in my life, {{and hope to}} again. But after all, he's a shrewd fellow. He's made money on the Stock Exchange <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and he's had the sense not to run up against us. He's not likely to refuse a clear twenty {{thousand}} pounds' profit on some shares he's not particularly interested in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{brain is}} weary, friend," [...] he admitted, passing {{his hand over}} his forehead. [...] "I have a great fatigue. The {{thoughts}} jump about. <b>This</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> has been one of fierce excitements. Everything, almost your daily life, has been planned. We shall go over it within a day or so. Meanwhile, remember this. It is our great aim to keep England out of the war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Daubuz' head man, Trenton, is {{the only}} one I could trust; and he wants fancy, though his style is broad and bold. He made a pyramid of pines {{relieved}} with grapes, without destroying the outline, very good, <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> at Hellingsley. But Trenton has been upset on the railroad, and much injured. Even if he recover, his hand will tremble so for the next month that! could have no confidence in him.' ...|$|E
50|$|The seventh {{final week}} was {{broadcast}} on 20 November 2009. <b>This</b> was the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> Idol 2009 {{was to be}} broadcast from the Idol Studio in Stockholm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye kin {{be thankful}} to the Lord, Jeff Briggs, that <b>this</b> didn't happen <b>last</b> <b>week</b> when I {{was down on}} my back with rheumatiz. But ye're never grateful." ...|$|R
50|$|Months later, Lifeguard and Thunderbird {{returned}} to the X-Men, apparently not locating Slipstream. Together with Thunderbird, she joined the X-Corporation. However <b>this</b> only <b>lasted</b> <b>weeks,</b> as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of M-Day, leading Cyclops to call for the disbanding of all offices.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{a respectable}} old man, really," [...] said his neighbour; [...] "I never took a liberty in my life. But at my age, sir, you get nervous; standin' about {{the streets as}} I been <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> an' sleepin' in them doss-houses--Oh, they're dreadful rough places--a dreadful rough lot there! Yes," [...] {{the old man said}} again, as Shelton turned to look at him, struck by the real self-pity in his voice, [...] "dreadful rough places!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{weather has}} grievously {{depressed}} me <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and I {{have not been}} fit to speak to anybody. I had much interruption {{in the early part}} of it though, from a pleasant visitor; and I have not been able to look rightly at your pretty little book. Nevertheless, I'm quite sure your strength is in private letter writing, and that a curious kind of shyness prevents your doing yourself justice in print. You might also surely have found a more pregnant motto about bird's nests! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{then it was}} so! She's {{been very}} queer, saur, <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> or two. O yes, sending {{messages}} down the spakin'-tube which were like madness itself, and ordering us this and that, till we would take no notice at all. I see them both go out last night, and possibly they went for a holiday not expecting ye, or maybe for good! Shure, if ye'd written, saur, I'd ha' got the place ready, ye being out of a man, too, though it's not me duty at all!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{come for}} {{help of the}} best kind. They have their little printed private prayers, but some are not content with <b>this.</b> Marosgagalo came <b>last</b> <b>week</b> with a slip of paper-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of late," [...] {{continued}} the girl, [...] "I've bin havin' extra work in <b>this</b> way, and <b>last</b> <b>week</b> I got twelve children's ulsters to make up. This job when finished would bring me six and sixpence." ...|$|R
50|$|The WHO {{official}} {{added that}} when the ICMR eventually handed over the information, the facts were out of place. “Their document said that one case each was reported in February 2016, November 2016 and then January 2017. When we published <b>this</b> information <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> the Ministry informed us that the first case in February 2016 was a typo. The handling of information by the Ministry has been disappointing,” the official said.|$|R
6000|$|The plain little brougham {{drove off}} in the mist, and the idlers dispersed. [...] "Well, we hardly know how {{to look at things}} in these times!" [...] said Solomon. [...] "There was a man dropped down dead yesterday, not so very many miles from here; and what wi' that, and this moist weather, 'tis scarce worth one's while to begin any work o' {{consequence}} to-day. I'm in such a low key with drinking nothing but small table ninepenny <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> or two that I shall call and warm up at the Mar'ners as I pass along." ...|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{leaned back}} and watched her silently for a few minutes. During <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> our young lady had been {{thinking}} a good deal, and was conscious of {{a strong desire to}} tell Jane Bassett how much she loved and thanked her for all her patient and faithful care during the six months now nearly over. But she was proud, and humility was hard to learn; self-will was sweet, and to own one's self in the wrong a most distasteful task. The penitent {{did not know how to}} begin, so waited for an opportunity, and presently it came.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s {{the finest}} sight I ever saw in my life, Bross," [...] {{he said when}} the other had finished. [...] "I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. I’ve been feeling very low <b>this</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and it’s done me good. Don’t talk {{nonsense}} about leaving the ship. I wouldn’t lose you for anything after this, but {{if you like to}} ship a fresh mate and crew you can please yourself. If you’ll only come up to the house and let Mrs. Pearson see you—she’s been ailing—I’ll give you a couple of pounds. Now, get your bonnet and come." ...|$|E
