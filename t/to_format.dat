25|$|From the 1970s {{until the}} late 1990s, most Australian plates were of the form xxx·xxx (with x being either letters or numbers)—for example, aaa·nnn in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory; naa.nnn in Western Australia, where the {{starting}} number was between six and nine; and nnn.aaa in Queensland. More recently as these series have reached the limit of their capacity, different states and territories have chosen different continuations, so the commonality with respect <b>to</b> <b>format</b> is at an end. The most recent adoption of a new sequence plate is {{in the state of}} Victoria, which from 2013 issues plates in the format naa.naa. Nevertheless, standard issue plates have the same dimensions regardless of their state-of-issue so there remains an element of consistency between them.|$|E
500|$|When The Motion Picture was announced, many {{synthesizer}} artists submitted demo {{tapes to}} Paramount. Ramsay and Wise consulted {{and decided that}} the film should have a unique audio style; they were particularly concerned with avoiding sounds that had become pervasive and clichéd due to repetitious use in other science fiction movies. Events such as Enterprise bridge viewscreen activation were kept silent {{to provide a more}} comfortable atmosphere. In contrast, almost every action on the Klingon bridge made noise to reflect the aliens' harsh aesthetic. While much of the effects were created using digital synthesizers, acoustic recordings were used as well. The wormhole's sucking sounds were created by slowing down and reversing old Paramount stock footage of a cowboy fight, while the warp acceleration [...] "stretch" [...] sound was built on a slowed-down cymbal crash. The crew encountered difficulty in transferring the [...] tapes used for creating the sounds to the 35mm film used for the final prints; while the film was to be released with Dolby sound, Serafine found it was easier to mix the sounds without regard <b>to</b> <b>format</b> and add the specific format after, during the later transfer to 35mm.|$|E

He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going <b>to</b> <b>format</b> how he's going to convey it.

[...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album.
