They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated.

Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.|$|E
