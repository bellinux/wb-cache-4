This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} a novel methodology for predicting voting intentions and referendum results using online search traffic data from Google, which was tested and validated in six referendum races. Said <b>referendums,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> 2014 Scottish <b>Referendum,</b> <b>the</b> 2015 Greek <b>Referendum,</b> <b>the</b> 2016 UK <b>Referendum,</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Hungarian <b>Referendum,</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Italian <b>Referendum,</b> and <b>the</b> 2017 Turkish <b>Referendum,</b> were of {{significance for the}} European Union and received wide national and international attention.

Our results exhibited good performance, while, in some cases, were more accurate than official polls.|$|R

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{government}} held {{a nationwide}} referendum on {{a declaration of}} sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott <b>the</b> <b>referendum,</b> while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote, but <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the HSP {{president}} Daniel Srb argued that <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> was illegitimate since 71% of Croatian voters {{had not taken}} part in <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> or had voted against the entry of Croatia into the EU, and warned that only 28% of Croatian voters had supported joining the EU. Srb also added that Croatian citizens had shown distrust of the Croatian Government. Željko Sačić, a right-wing politician, stated that the government destroyed the concept of Croatian citizens and created an impression that Croatia was unable to govern itself. Sačić stated {{that the government had}} brought Croatia into a decaying organization in an illegitimate way, adding that <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> result was a defeat of Croatian independence and they would challenge its validity in court. By the 3 March 2012 deadline, the Constitutional Court of Croatia received 22 appeals challenging the referendum's legality; it ruled against them all.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For <b>the</b> <b>referendum,</b> all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in <b>the</b> <b>referendum,</b> nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of <b>the</b> <b>referendum,</b> there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> Newfoundland <b>Referendums</b> of 1948 were {{a series}} of two <b>referendums</b> to decide <b>the</b> {{political}} future of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning on the day of <b>the</b> <b>referendum.</b> The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, <b>the</b> <b>Referendum</b> Party renamed itself <b>the</b> <b>Referendum</b> Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, while {{a member}} of the Centre Party, Sven-Olle Olsson, a former farmer, was elected as Sjöbo's Municipal commissioner.The Centre Party in Sjöbo, led by Olsson, motioned before Sjöbo's {{municipal}} assembly in June 1987 for a referendum on the acceptance of foreign refugees in the municipality. The motion came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality, an idea Olsson disliked. It has been speculated that the reason behind the motion was not these fifteen refugees, a small number for the municipality, but, instead, Olsson's idea to create a protest against Sweden's positive stance on refugees. Despite heavy protests from most of the country, Sjöbo's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> in 1988. If <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> passed, it would completely ban Sjöbo from accepting foreign refugees.|$|E

5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>referendum,</b> the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of <b>the</b> <b>referendum.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, <b>the</b> <b>Referendum</b> Party {{spent more}} on press advertising {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} <b>the</b> <b>Referendum</b> Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself <b>the</b> <b>Referendum</b> Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a Eurosceptic pressure group called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E
