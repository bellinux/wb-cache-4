40|$|Woodpeckers are {{the primary}} tree-cavity {{producers}} in North America and, through their process of cavity excavation, they create nesting and roosting habitat for a complex web of cavity-using species. Managing for potential woodpecker nest trees requires an understanding of factors that influence decisions by which woodpecker select trees for nest cavity excavation, including tree decay availability associated with softened heartwood and sapwood in trees. We evaluated woodpecker nest cavity excavation {{in relation to the}} nature and availability of decay in trembling aspen (Populustremuloides) using 12 years of nest and tree decay class data from British Columbia. We used a cavity-nest web to visually depict decay selection profiles for six woodpecker species and compared these woodpecker decay selection profiles to the availability of decay in aspen (96. 7 % of all cavity nests found), identifying the most suitable nest tree stages used by woodpeckers. The suitable woodpecker nest <b>tree</b> <b>stage</b> consists primarily of live unhealthy trees and recently dead trees (93. 9 % of active nests found in aspen). Compared to non-nest trees (trees within which no cavity nests were found during the study period), live trees that were used for nest cavity excavation had higher annual probabilities of entering the suitable woodpecker nest <b>tree</b> <b>stage</b> than non-nest trees, and they also had a lower probability of progressing outside of this stage. This suggests excavation decisions involve a balance of competing tradeoffs between ease of excavation and tree security. Nest trees remained within the suitable woodpecker nest <b>tree</b> <b>stage</b> for an average of 11. 8 years, and almost half of this time involved live trees in an unhealthy state. We suggest that forest management guidelines that focus on retaining only dead trees to provide cavities for wildlife are missing a significant component of available and future tree cavity resources...|$|E

40|$|Aboveground {{tree biomass}} (M) can be {{estimated}} using a power function {{in the form of}} M = aD(b) where a and b are the scaling coefficient and scaling exponent, respectively, and D the tree breast-height diameter. Both a and b are reported to vary with species, site and age. However West et al. [West, G. B., Brown, J. H., Enquist, B. J., 1999. A general model for the structure and allometry of plant vascular systems. Nature 400, 6646671 suggested that M should scale against D with a universal exponent (b = 8 / 3), because the scaling exponent would depend on an optimal tree architecture. Moreover a should be related with the wood density (p) [Enquist, B. J., West. G. B., Charnov, E. L., Brown, J. H., 1999. Allometric scaling of production and life-history variation in vascular plants. Nature 401, 907 - 911]. We collected 49 datasets of different species (most from the literature) with individual data of diameter, mass and tree height. We analysed the height-diameter relationship and estimated b and a for each dataset, in order to test whether: (i) the scaling exponent may be considered universal or, conversely, dependent on species, <b>tree</b> <b>stage</b> or site and (ii) a was correlated with wood density. Analysis of the height diameter relationship for each species and site generally allowed a juvenile, an adult and a mature stage to be identified. b appeared to be related to <b>tree</b> <b>stage</b> but independent of species and site. The mean a value was also correlated with the wood density. We estimated tree biomass using different b exponents for each stage, deriving a from p. This approach was applied to a validation dataset and an average relative difference of 21. 4 % from the observed values was obtained. This would suggest that total forest aboveground biomass {{can be estimated}} by using functional allometry (i. e., universal b parameters), potentially avoiding any destructive tree sampling...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} habitat association and physiological performance in four congeneric species pairs exhibiting contrasting distributions between seasonally flooded and terra firme habitats in lowland tropical rain forests of French Guiana, including Virola and Iryanthera (Myristicaceae), Symphonia (Clusiaceae), and Eperua (Caesalpiniaceae). We analyzed 10 -year data sets of mapped and measured saplings (stems 150 cm in height and < 10 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) and trees (stems 10 cm dbh) across 37. 5 ha of permanent plots covering a 300 -ha zone, within which seasonally flooded areas (where the water table never descends below 1 m) have been mapped. Additionally, we tested the response of growth, survival, and leaf functional traits of these species to drought and flood stress in a controlled experiment. We tested for habitat preference using a modification of the torus translation method. Strong contrasting associations of the species pairs of Iryanthera, Virola, and Symphonia were observed at the sapling stage, and these associations strengthened for the <b>tree</b> <b>stage.</b> Neither species of Eperua {{was significantly associated with}} flooded habitats at the sapling stage, but E. falcata was significantly and positively associated with flooded forests at the <b>tree</b> <b>stage,</b> and trees of E. grandiflora were found almost exclusively in nonflooded habitats. Differential performance provided limited explanatory support for the observed habitat associations, with only congeners of Iryanthera exhibiting divergent sapling survival and tree growth. Seedlings of species associated with flooded forest tended to have higher photosynthetic capacity than their congeners at field capacity. In addition, they tended to have the largest reductions in leaf gas exchange and growth rate in response to experimental drought stress and the least reductions in response to experimental inundation. The corroboration of habitat association with differences in functional traits and, to a lesser extent, measures of performance provides an explanation for the regional coexistence of these species pairs. We suggest that specialization to seasonally flooded habitats may explain patterns of adaptive radiation in many tropical tree genera and thereby provide a substantial contribution to regional tree diversity...|$|E
