5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E
25|$|In Game 3, Atlanta showed its athleticism with {{an array}} of dunks from Josh Smith (26 points) and a strong {{interior}} performance by the rookie Al Horford (17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists), who also jawed with Paul Pierce {{near the end of the}} game. There would be more jawing in Game 4 between Zaza Pachulia and Kevin Garnett, but the outcome was a surprise: thanks to fourth quarter heroics by Joe Johnson and Smith, who combined to score 32 of Atlanta's 34 4th quarter points, the upstart Hawks rallied from a 10-point third quarter deficit in Game 4 to tie the series going back to Boston. Boston dominated Game 5, but in Game 6, six Hawks players finished in double figures to force a winner-take-all Game 7. The Hawks were no match for the Celtics in Game 7, as the Celtics held them to 26 points in the 1st half. 3 minutes into the 2nd half, the series' tensions finally boiled over when Marvin Williams was ejected for committing a hard foul on Rajon Rondo. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> Kevin Garnett was noted for trucking Zaza Pachulia while going for a screen.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Na'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, one calling it a [...] "tacky metaphor" [...] and others criticizing Cameron for his [...] "audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9/11". Cameron {{said that he was}} [...] "surprised at how much it did look like September 11", but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing. A French critic wrote: [...] "How can one not see the analogy {{with the collapse of the}} towers of the World Trade Center? [...] <b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> spectacular scene, all is justified [...] indigenous peoples (the allied forces)... to kill those who [...] just like terrorists." [...] Another writer noted that [...] "the U.S.' stand-ins are the perpetrators, and not the victims" [...] and described this reversal as [...] "the movie’s most seditious act".|$|E

She was his classmate at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee and they went out before he dated classmate Chelsea who would later become his wife. [...] "'They dated in freshman year, but <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> girl code, once you date an ex-boyfriend you're not friends anymore. Picture To Burn is about him. Because he's always had big old trucks and stuff,' Taylor Swift said. She was frequently frustrated by his narcissistic and cocky nature, and decided to write a song about how she felt at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music. It was co-written with Liz Rose on guitar, and given a comedic edge (an idea of Swift's). Swift found herself sitting, playing her guitar, and saying, [...] "I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!', a line that was ultimately developed into the song's chorus. Swift described it as brutally honest, ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' <b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
500|$|Rowland's {{voice is}} {{classified}} as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R, pop, hip hop, soul, rock and dance. Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it...And <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction".|$|E

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an owner}} trust, {{there is more}} {{flexibility}} in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities. [...] In an owner trust, both interest and principal due to subordinate securities {{can be used to}} pay senior securities. [...] Due to this, owner trusts can tailor maturity, risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs. [...] Usually, any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> all income is returned to the seller. Owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by over-collateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal, which leaves more collateral for the other classes.|$|E
2500|$|Although Epstein had had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{he made it clear}} that he wanted to change the Beatles’ early dress-code and attitude on stage, as they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, smoked, ate and swore, stopped and started songs when they felt like it, pretended to hit each other, and turned their backs to the audience. Epstein put a stop to their behaviour, insisting they wear more suitable clothes, and later suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances. Epstein: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits".|$|E

Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was HIV positive. Michael later said: [...] "It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too. I couldn't go through it with my family because I didn't know how {{to share it with}} them – they didn't even know I was gay." [...] In 1993, Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael's single, [...] "Jesus to a Child", is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album Older (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of his partner Feleppa, Michael said: [...] "It was a terribly depressing time.
