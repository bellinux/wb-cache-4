5|$|The Australian Swimming Union (ASU) did not {{recognise}} {{times that}} had been recorded in short-course pools in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> Evans was forced to return for the Australian Championships {{to qualify for the}} 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane. Despite winning neither of the breaststroke events, Evans successfully earned selection and lined up at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m breaststroke and the 4Ã—100m medley relay. In his favoured 100m event, Evans won bronze, having been led home by Adrian Moorhouse of England and Canada's Victor Davis. In the 200m event, Evans came fourth, almost four seconds behind the victorious Davis. He then combined with David Orbell, Jon Sieben and Brooks to win the medley relay in a Commonwealth Games record time. Canada reached the wall far ahead of Australia, but were disqualified for a premature changeover.|$|E

25|$|The Bandit War, or Bandit Wars, {{refers to}} a series of raids in Texas, started in 1910 before finally {{culminating}} in 1919, that were carried out by Mexican rebels from the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Chihuahua. Before 1914, the Carrancista faction was responsible for most of the attacks but in January 1915 rebels known as Seditionistas drafted the Plan of San Diego and began launching their own raids. The plan called for a race war, to rid the American border states of their Anglo-American population, and the annexation of the border states to Mexico. However, the Seditionistas were never able to launch a full-scale invasion of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>so</b> they resorted to conducting small raids into Texas. Much of the fighting involved the Texas Ranger Division, though the United States Army also engaged in small unit actions with bands of Seditionist raiders.|$|E

25|$|Along with hostility {{between the}} North and the South, there was {{friction}} between Mexicans and whites. For example, in New Mexico there was active {{resistance to the}} United States in the Taos Revolt, resulting in {{the execution of the}} U.S. governor of New Mexico. New Mexico proved to be the safest place for Mexicans in the United States because there is strength in numbers. Texas and California were more dangerous places because Mexicans were not the majority, and not all whites appreciated their presence there. California was particularly profitable for <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> many Americans wanted to move to that area. For instance, gold was discovered in 1849, causing Euro-Americans to rush to California. These individuals were very hostile towards Mexicans. In California alone, over 302 lynchings occurred between 1849 and 1902. During those years there were at least 5,000 lynchings in the United States as a whole. Most people associate lynchings with blacks. With about 73% of lynchings that occurred in the U.S. being those of African Americans, this association is understandable. However, Mexicans were lynched as well, though it is not talked about as often. Not all resistance to Mexicans included violence, however. On April 13, 1850, the state legislature passed a $20 per month tax on non-American-born miners in California during the Gold Rush. The tax primarily targeted Latin Americans. Resistance to the Foreign Miners Tax came not only from Mexicans but also from French, Chilean, and German miners, along with merchants whose businesses suffered {{as a direct result of}} the tax.|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 1907, Sir George Gibb, {{managing}} director of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), appointed Stanley as its general manager. The UERL was the holding company of four underground railways in central London. Three of these (the District Railway, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway) were already in operation and the fourth (the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway) was about to open. The UERL had been established by American financier Charles Yerkes and much of the finance and equipment had been brought from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>so</b> Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines {{in just a few years}} had put the company in a precarious monetary position and income was not sufficient to pay the interest on its loans. [...] Stanley's responsibility was to restore its finances.|$|E
500|$|Rosenblatt {{contacted}} Ed Steinberg, {{who ran the}} Rock America video {{company and}} asked him if he could spare a few hours to make a music video for [...] "Everybody" [...] with Madonna on stage at her next performance in Danceteria. The idea was to play the video as promotion across <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>so</b> that people will come to recognize an image of Madonna and her performance. Rosenblatt offered Steinberg $1,000 for the in-house production video, when artists like Duran Duran and Michael Jackson were spending six figure sums on videos. They finally agreed on $1,500. With the low-budget, the video was directed by Steinberg. Steinberg suggested shooting the video on location at the Paradise Garage, a downtown gay disco, instead of filming a live performance. Madonna's friend Debi Mazar did the makeup and joined her other backup dancers, namely Erika Belle and Bags Rilez. Mazar brought a few of her friends to act as a disco crowd in the video, including African-American graffiti artist Michael Stewart. Steinberg was impressed by Madonna's professionalism on the set and he helped to send copies of the tape to nightclubs across America which used dance music videos for their entertainment. This promotion helped the song to grow from being a dance hit in New York to a nationwide hit.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>So</b> became one of Geffen Records' most commercially successful releases, peaking at number two and remaining on the chart for ninety-three weeks. In April 1986, [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] {{was released}} as the album's lead single and became Gabriel's first and only {{number one on the}} Billboard Hot 100, displacing Genesis' first and only US number one [...] "Invisible Touch". The track reached number four in the United Kingdom, where it ties with [...] "Games Without Frontiers" [...] as his highest charting single, and peaked at number one in Canada. The success of [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] can be seen, in part, due to its hugely popular and innovative stop motion music video, designed by Aardman Animations.
