40|$|Exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> models {{results in}} {{self-esteem}} shifts that influence people's motivation to diet. This research study applies a goal perspective {{to explain the}} effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> models on dieters' motivation to lose weight. Two (one-week) weight loss program studies that included treatment conditions in which participants were repeatedly exposed <b>to</b> either a <b>thin</b> model or <b>to</b> control conditions with either a neutral dieting-related cue (Study 1) or a normal-sized model (Study 2) were conducted. Female participants who were exposed <b>to</b> the <b>thin</b> model perceived their dieting goals as less attainable, engaged in more goal-inconsistent behavior (i. e., consuming unhealthy snacks), and had less success losing weight. The effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> models on weight loss success is mediated specifically by the perceived attainability of the thin ideal...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the role of processing in women’s responses <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> idealized images of beauty. A sample of 144 women viewed magazine advertisements containing either thin ideal or product images. Instructional set was manipulated with three levels: control, social comparison, and fantasy instructions. It was found that exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> ideal images led to increased negative mood and body dissatisfaction, while instructional set had its effect on positive mood and body dissatisfaction. For thin ideal images, social comparison instructions led to greater negative mood and body dissatisfaction, while fantasy instructions led to improved positive mood. Importantly, regression analyses indicated that both comparison processing (negatively) and fantasy processing (positively) were associated with women’s response <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> ideal images. It was concluded {{that the nature of}} the processing women engage in is crucial to their response <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> ideal images...|$|R
25|$|Warm {{winters in}} the Gulf of Saint Lawrence have led <b>to</b> <b>thinner</b> and more {{unstable}} ice there. In 2007, Canada's federal fisheries ministry reported {{that while the}} pups are born on the ice as usual, the ice floes have started to break up before the pups learn to swim, causing the pups to drown. Canada reduced the 2007 quota by 20%, because overflights showed large numbers of seal pups were lost to thin and melting ice. In southern Labrador and off Newfoundland's northeast coast, however, there was extra heavy ice in 2007, and the coast guard estimated as many as 100 vessels were trapped in ice simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers <b>to</b> <b>thinner</b> roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

40|$|Exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media {{images is}} thought to play a {{significant}} role in the development of body image dissatisfaction (BID) amongst females. In this study we examined whether individual differences in body mass index (BMI) and neuroticism can make females more vulnerable to BID upon exposure to overweight media images than thin media images. Female volunteers were randomly assigned <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> or overweight exposure conditions. Before exposure all gave height and weight data and completed a 12 -item neuroticism (N) questionnaire. While exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images was associated with greater BID, in the overweight exposure condition there was an interaction between BMI and N so that with increasing BMI those higher in N experienced greater BID. Female BID may not, therefore, be solely restricted <b>to</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images. The implications for future research, as well as BID prevention programmes, are discussed.

40|$|Binge eating {{has long}} been a {{prevalent}} issue for young women. Though the development of binge eating is multifactorial, much attention has focused on the etiological mechanisms underlying binge behaviour. Affect regulation models are empirically supported; models illustrate the importance of affective dysregulation and negative experiences as antecedents of binge eating. The sociocultural pressure to achieve thinness is also a known risk factor for the development of binge eating. Previous research has shown that women eat less when exposed <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images. Several studies also indicate that social comparisons <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images result in negative affect and body dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, some research has shown that for dieters, <b>thin</b> images appear <b>to</b> have self-enhancement effects. Research to date has focused on the internalization of the thin ideal and the effects of exposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> models in studies examining media influence on pathological eating. The current study explored the effect of social comparison <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> and plus size media images on candy consumption, negative affect and body satisfaction among binge eaters and nonbinge eaters. One hundred and one undergraduate females participated in the current experiment, during which they were exposed <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> and plus size media images and asked to engage in an objective social comparison task followed by a taste test. Results indicated that binge eaters ate more compared to nonbinge eaters, specifically postexposure <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images. Increases in negative affect were found to occur as a function of one?s binge status and image type. Further, comparisons <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> media images led to decreases in body satisfaction whereas plus size images had the opposite effect. Results are discussed in relation to the etiological models of binge eating, differentiating factors associated with binge eating, and upward and downward social comparisons...|$|R
2500|$|During this time, Liberace {{worked to}} refine his act. He added the {{candelabrum}} as his trademark, {{inspired by a}} similar prop in the Chopin biopic A Song to Remember (1945). He adopted [...] "Liberace" [...] as his stage name, making a point in press releases that it was pronounced [...] "Liber-Ah-chee". He wore white tie and tails for better visibility in large halls. Besides clubs and occasional work as an accompanist and rehearsal pianist, Liberace played for private parties, including those at the Park Avenue home of millionaire oilman J.Paul Getty. By 1947, he was billing himself as [...] "Liberace—the most amazing piano virtuoso of the present day". He {{had to have a}} piano to match his growing presence, so he bought a rare, oversized, gold-leafed Blüthner Grand, which he hyped up in his press kit as a [...] "priceless piano". (Later, he performed with an array of extravagant, custom-decorated pianos, some encrusted with rhinestones and mirrors.) [...] He moved to the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood in 1947 and was performing at local clubs, such as Ciro's and The Mocambo, for stars such as Rosalind Russell, Clark Gable, Gloria Swanson, and Shirley Temple. He did not always play to packed rooms, and he learned to perform with extra energy <b>to</b> <b>thinner</b> crowds, to maintain his own enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Tadolini, who, for {{the first}} time is about to appear in London, I am sure will become a great favorite, as she {{possesses}} all qualities necessary to captivate an English audience. She is inclined to , but she is very handsome on the stage, with dangerous eyes—the whitest shoulder in the world—and a sense of enjoyment in her acting, which your audience {{will not be able to}} resist. Tadolini's voice is a clear soprano-mezzo-soprano in its richest quality, with an intonation that approaches, when necessary, to the contralto. It is as clear as a bell, round, full, and sonorous, perfectly flexible and capable of all those modulations which a great artist like her dashes off, but which are so painful and difficult <b>to</b> <b>thinner</b> voices, and less qualified science. I heard the prima donna to great disadvantage, as she disdained to sing to an empty house (from political excitement), and used merely one half of her powers. Her acting was equally restrained, but the inward spirit could not be altogether subdued, and she occasionally broke forth into silvery and impassioned notes, and abandoned herself to that natural gaiety of song that rendered her in the scene the most captivating of coquettes. Had Tadolini known that the Times has ears everywhere, she might have exerted herself to please them; but criticism has art and judgment, and though she sung at mezzo voce, it was not difficult to prognosticate complete success for her at Her Majesty's Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates <b>to</b> <b>thinner,</b> lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E

60|$|It might {{reasonably}} {{have been}} supposed {{that she was}} listening to the wind, which rose somewhat as the night advanced, and laid hold of the attention. The wind, indeed, seemed made for the scene, as the scene seemed made for the hour. Part of its tone was quite special; what was heard there could be heard nowhere else. Gusts in innumerable series followed each other from the north-west, and when each one of them raced past the sound of its progress resolved into three. Treble, tenor, and bass notes were to be found therein. The general ricochet of the whole over pits and prominences had the gravest pitch of the chime. Next there could be heard the baritone buzz of a holly tree. Below these in force, above them in pitch, a dwindled voice strove hard at a husky tune, which was the peculiar local sound alluded <b>to.</b> <b>Thinner</b> and less immediately traceable than the other two, it was far more impressive than either. In it lay what may be called the linguistic peculiarity of the heath; and being audible nowhere on earth off a heath, it afforded a shadow of reason for the woman's tenseness, which continued as unbroken as ever.|$|E
