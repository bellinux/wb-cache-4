40|$|The {{operational}} scheduling at {{coal handling}} facilities {{is of the}} utmost importance to ensure that the coal consuming processes are supplied with a constant feed of good quality coal. Although the Sasol Coal Handling Facility (CHF) were not designed to perform coal blending during the coal handling process, CHF has to blend the different sources to ensure that the quality of the feed supplied is of a stable nature. As a result, the operation of the plant has become an extremely complex process. Consequently, human intelligence is no longer sufficient to perform coal handling scheduling and therefore a scheduling model is required to ensure optimal plant operation and optimal downstream process performance. After various attempts to solve the scheduling model optimally, i. e. with exact solution methods, it was found that {{it is not possible to}} accurately model the complexities of CHF in such a way that the currently available exact solvers can solve it in an acceptable operational time. Various alternative solution approaches are compared, in terms of solution quality and execution speed, using a simplified version of the CHF scheduling problem. This investigation indicates that the Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic is the most efficient solution method to provide approximate solutions. The metaheuristic solution approach allows one to model the typical sequential thoughts of a control room operator and sequential operating procedures. Thus far, these sequential rules could not be modelled in the simultaneous equation environment required for exact solution methods. An SA metaheuristic is developed to solve the practical scheduling model. A novel SA approach is applied where, instead of the actual solution being used for neighbourhood solution representation, the neighbours are indirectly represented by the rules used to generate neighbourhood solutions. It is also found that the initial temperature should not be a fixed value, but should be a multiple of the objective function value of the initial solution. An inverse arctan-based cooling schedule function outperforms traditional cooling schedules as it provides the required diversification and intensification behaviour of the SA. The scheduling model solves within 45 seconds and provides good, practically executable results. The metaheuristic approach to scheduling is therefore successful as the plant complexities and intricate operational philosophies can be accurately modelled using the sequential nature of programming languages and provides good approximate optimal solutions in a short solution time. Tests done with live CHF data indicate that the metaheuristic solution outperforms the current scheduling methodologies applied in the business. The implementation of the scheduler will lead to a more stable factory feed, which will increase production yields and therefore increase company profits. By reducing the amount of coal re-handling (in terms of <b>throw-outs</b> and load-backs at mine bunkers), the scheduler will reduce the coal handling facility’s annual operating cost by approximately R 4. 6 million (ZAR). Furthermore, the approaches discussed in this document can be applied to any continuous product scheduling environment.

5000|$|Bill also {{invented the}} {{pull-out}} and <b>throw-out</b> pilot chute. [...] A pilot chute {{is a small}} parachute used to extract and deploy a main parachute. The <b>throw-out</b> approach replaces the spring-loaded pilot chute which was released by a rip-cord. The <b>throw-out</b> system allows the skydiver to deploy his or her pilot chute directly into the air stream. Other inventions include the Skyhook RSL safety device and the [...] "Sigma System" [...] for tandem drogue release.|$|E
50|$|The {{pull-out}} and <b>throw-out</b> pilot chutes {{are identical}} in construction; {{the difference is}} in their connection to the handle and the bridle, {{and in the way}} they are packed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>throw-out</b> {{pilot chute}} {{is the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot chute is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} {{container}} (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot chute. When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot chute into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the pilot chute continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out pilot chute and the <b>throw-out</b> pilot chute were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|E

50|$|Propulsion is by a {{single-stage}} Solid-fuel rocket motor, {{which is}} ignited {{at a distance}} of few meters from the launch tube: as the <b>throw-out</b> charge ejects the missile from its canister, it is trailing a wire from its rear.

50|$|Drogues used on tandem-systems are {{basically}} large <b>throw-out</b> pilot chutes, but the bridle is anchored on the container with a release system. When the user throws the drogue, the drogue inflates and the bridle extends. The deployed drogue slows down the free-fall {{speed of the}} tandem pair. When the user wants to open the parachute, he pulls a ripcord, releasing the bridle and allowing the drogue to open the main container.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of smaller higher {{performance}} canopies, the drag induced by trailing a pilot chute behind a canopy has become a significant concern. To reduce this drag some pilot chute designs of the Pull-out and <b>Throw-out</b> variety are collapsible. Once deployment of the parachute has occurred a kill line running up {{the center of the}} pilot chute bridle becomes loaded. This kill line pulls down on the apex of the pilot chute collapsing it and greatly reducing its drag on the canopy.|$|E

50|$|After {{activating}} {{the power}} {{supply to the}} missile electronics, the gunner waits for electricity supply and gyros to stabilize, puts the sights on target and tracks it smoothly with the launch tube's iron sights, and pulls the trigger on the grip stock. This activates the seeker electronics and the missile attempts to lock onto the target. If the target is producing a strong enough signal and the angular tracking rate is within acceptable launch parameters, the missile alerts the gunner that the target is locked on by illuminating a light in the sight mechanism, and producing a constant buzzing noise. The operator then has 0.8 seconds to provide lead to the target while the missile's on-board power supply is activated and the <b>throw-out</b> motor ignited.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} period of settlement, the São Mateus coast was dotted by bays, some {{peppered}} with small beaches. One of these, which {{became known as}} Prainha, soon became the centre of a small fishing port. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing in his sixth volume of Saudades da Terra, referred to the area as São Mateus da Prainha, noting: [...] "In addition to the church of São Mateus Além, is a small bay of white sand and small stones in places, where on occasion they <b>throw-out</b> their nets and trammels to catch many fish, principally mullet."

50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common <b>throw-out</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Designed {{and built}} by the English Electric Co., four steam turbine units of high pressure, {{intermediate}} pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 250 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft, set to <b>throw-out</b> at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP cylinder inlet steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been bled off to feed heaters), returned to the IP cylinder (with some bled off to LP feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house. The turbine/generator assembly was mounted on reinforced concrete pedestals that ran {{along the length of}} the turbine hall.|$|E
50|$|The Type 97 mortar {{examined}} had {{an extension}} fitted to the sight, raising {{the latter to}} the level of the muzzle of the mortar. This extension probably was added to permit sighting of the weapon when it was deeply dug in or slightly in defilade. Elevation scale of the sight is graduated in 50-mil intervals from 700 to 1,600 mils, and a micrometer drum enables elevation readings to be made to the nearest mil. The collimator can be traversed in a full circle, and the azimuth scale is calibrated in 100-mil graduations in two sections of 3,200 mils each. As in the case of elevation, a micrometer drum permits azimuth readings to be made to the nearest mil. There is a <b>throw-out</b> lever for rapid traverse of the collimator, which may be placed at an angle of elevation and locked in position by a series of meshing notches. There are no open sights for rough laying of the piece.|$|E
50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular <b>throw-out</b> {{deployment}} system where the pilot chute does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the deployment bag from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked during packing or where the kill line has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the pilot chute. It can be caused by a mis-routed pilot chute bridle. It can also be caused by too large a deployment bag and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped deployment bag. If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a pilot chute hesitation.|$|E

50|$|Game 2 {{featured}} a match up between David Price, and John Lackey. In the first inning, Jacoby Ellsbury hit a blooper-single before stealing second {{and moving to}} third on a missed <b>throw-out</b> attempt. Dustin Pedroia got the sac-fly to bring him home. Ortiz, who had never hit a homer off Price, hit a solo home run into the bullpen to give the Red Sox an early 2-0 lead. The next inning, Tampa hit a sac fly of their own to make it 2-1. In the fifth, Tampa was trailing 5-1 before Loney hit a two-run double to make it 5-3. In {{the bottom of the}} fifth, Boston would however get their three run lead back on a Pedroia line drive double that scored Ellsbury from first. In the bottom eighth while it was still a two-run game, David Ortiz hit a deep solo homer. Lackey allowed four runs while coming through in clutch situations to keep the Sox in the lead throughout the game. According to Joe Maddon after the game, Price did not pitch badly even though he gave up seven earned runs. During Price's post-game interview, he claimed it was a lucky win for the Sox.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{couplings}} {{for high}} speed turbocompressors or pumps {{is essential to}} transmit power from the driver. Typical couplings are either of the lubricated gear or dry diaphragm type design.

Recent test stand and field data on continuous lube gear type couplings have forced a closer examination of design tolerances and concepts to avoid operational instabilities. Two types of mechanical instabilities are reviewed in this paper: (1) entrapped fluid, and (2) gear mesh instability resulting in spacer <b>throw-out</b> onset.

40|$|Since {{the oldest}} {{globular}} clusters (GCs) are early residuals from {{the formation of}} the Milky Way (MW), GCs were exposed to the likely evolving potential of our Galaxy. The expulsion of the residual-gas from the GC’s embedded progenitors is sensitive to the conditions in the pre-MW gas cloud. By means of N-body computations it is shown that gas <b>throw-out</b> from initially mass-segregated GCs affect the shape of the low-mass stellar mass function (MF) and that its imprint might still be visible in the present-day MF (PDMF). The strength of the tidal-field at birth influences the degree of gas-expulsion driven low-mass-star depletion and therefore the PDMF probes the MW potential at the time of GC formation. It is argued that among the old GC population in the MW, younger GCs show stronger low-mass-star loss than older GCs. This is shown to be consistent with a contracting and self-gravitating cloud in which fluctuations in the pre-MW potential grow with time. An initially relatively smooth tidal field evolved into a grainy potential within a dynamical time-scale of the collapsing cloud (based on [1]) ...|$|E
40|$|Like pedestrians, bicyclists are {{vulnerable}} road users, representing a population {{with a high}} risk of fatal and severe injuries in traffic accidents as they are unprotected during vehicle collisions. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the kinematics response of bicyclists and the correlation of the injury severity with vehicle impact speed. Twenty-four car-bicyclist cases with detailed information were selected for accident reconstruction using mathematical models, which was implemented in the MADYMO program. The dynamic response of bicyclists in the typical impact configuration and the correlation of head impact conditions were analyzed and discussed with respect to the head impact speed, time of head impact and impact angle of bicyclists to vehicle impact speed. Furthermore, the injury distribution of bicyclists and the risk of head injuries and fractures of lower limbs were investigated in terms of vehicle impact speed. The results indicate that wrap-around distance (WAD), head impact speed, time of head impact, head impact angle, and <b>throw-out</b> distance (TOD) of the bicyclists have a strong relationship with vehicle impact speed. The vehicle impact speed corresponding to a 50 % probability of head AIS 2 + injuries, head AIS 3 + injuries, and lower limb fracture risk for bicyclists is 53. 8 km/h, 58. 9 km/h, and 41. 2 km/h, respectively. A higher vehicle impact speed produces a higher injury risk to bicyclist. The results could provide background knowledge for the establishment or modification of pedestrian regulations considering bicyclist protection as well as being helpful for developing safety measures and protection devices for bicyclists...|$|E

Although this long adopted pattern ensures electricity availability on demand at all times through the least cost proven technology, it is highly unsustainable due to its drastic impacts on depletion of resources, environmental emissions and electricity prices. Solar thermal Hybrid power plants among all other renewable energy technologies have the potential of replacing the central utility model of conventional power plants, the understood integration of solar thermal technologies into existing conventional power plants shows the opportunity of combining low cost reliable power and Carbon emission reduction. A literature review on the current concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies and their suitability for integration into conventional power cycles was concluded, the best option was found be in the so called Integrated solar combined cycle systems (ISCCS); the plant is built and operated like a normal combined cycle, with a solar circuit consisting of central tower receiver and heliostat field adding heat to the bottoming Rankine cycle.

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} and low self-esteem among young women {{is a growing}} concern in today’s society. Due to this growing concern, this subject has been given a lot of attention both in media and through academic research during recent years. One area that has been highly criticized and examined is the idealized ideals often presented in media and advertisement today. These ideals can, according to literature, harm young women due to social comparison with these idealized images. According to previous research, this social comparison can {{have a negative effect on}} both self-esteem and body satisfaction. Research also show that continued exposure to such ideals can lead to internalization of thin and beauty ideals, which in turn is proven to be a strong predictor for these images negative affect on self-esteem and body satisfaction. Because of these findings and the critique of these ideals in media, this is an important subject to study both because of the ethical concerns with continuing to reinforce these ideals in advertisement, and from a society’s perspective in order to learn who might need extra protection in order to not be harmed by these ideals. Therefore, this study will firstly examine if we can see a negative effect on high school student’s self-esteem and body satisfaction, after being exposed to idealized images (in our case thin-models). Our study will also examine, in a second part, if we can see, depending on the lifestyle of the students, if some girls are more vulnerable than others to the exposure of idealized images. The second part of the study will contribute with information of which young women that need extra protection and attention to not develop low self-esteem due to the pressure of living up to the ideals. The method of our study is mostly of a deductive nature since this is an extensively researched topic, where pre-established methods and theories can be found. However, as the second part of the study has not been previous research this part will use a combination of deductive and inductive strategy. To collect the primary data an experimental design is used, with pre-established measurements for self-esteem and body satisfaction. Moreover, statements regarding the participant’s lifestyle are constructed with the help of AIOs lifestyle questionnaire as an inspiration. The experiment processes consists of two steps. First, the participants are exposed to two images, either thin-model images, normal sized woman images, or control images (which is images without any persons in it). After the exposure, the participants are asked to answer the questionnaire consisting of the self-esteem measurement, the body satisfaction measurement, and the lifestyle statements. The first part of our study did not show any sign of the thin-model image having any effect on the participant’s self-esteem or body satisfaction. However, we found a significant difference between the girls of 15 - 17 years old and those who were 18 - 20 years old self-esteem and body satisfaction means. Where the girls 15 - 17 scored significantly lower in both. Our conclusion of these findings is that there still is a high internalization of unhealthy thin and beauty ideals especially among the younger girls. Therefore, idealized media still is harmful for these girls since they are reinforcing and contributing to these ideals in society. For the second part of the study, we found a significant difference between the Party lifestyle group and the Sport lifestyle group’s self-esteem, where the Party Lifestyle group had a significantly lower self-esteem than the Sport lifestyle group. Further, we could also see a connection <b>throw-out</b> all of our results between self-esteem and body satisfaction, where those who scored low in self-esteem most often also scored low in body satisfaction and the other way around. This finding showed us that those with a party lifestyle are more vulnerable to idealized media exposure in that way that they are more likely to internalize unhealthy beauty and thin ideals...|$|E
