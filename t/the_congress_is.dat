5|$|The 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) {{was held}} in the February 8 House of Culture in Pyongyang, North Korea, from 10–14 October 1980. <b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. 3,062 delegates {{represented}} the party's membership; 117 foreign delegates attended the congress, without the right to speak. The congress saw the reappointment of Kim Il-sung as WPK General Secretary and the Presidium of the Politburo established as the highest organ of the party between congresses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> {{noteworthy}} {{because of}} the extent of democratization which took place within the party. The role of the Central Committee in decision-making was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened. The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E
5|$|India is the world's {{most populous}} democracy. A {{parliamentary}} republic with a multi-party system, it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), {{and more than}} 40 regional parties. <b>The</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> considered centre-left in Indian political culture, and the BJP right-wing. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held {{a majority in the}} parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.|$|E

50|$|The {{initiative}} for <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> superficially taken by an Ottoman Albanian Constitutional Committee (Osmanli arnaut meşrutiyet komisioni) in Diber. However the entire organization {{was formed by}} the Young Turks. The first impression <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> going to be purely Albanian because the first invitations were addressed only to Albanians. Gradually all other nationalities of the Albanian and Macedonian vilayets, excluding the Greeks, were welcomed to send delegates. The reason of <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> not unveiled producing suppositions.|$|R

25|$|Although Hong Kong has its {{separate}} political system, <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> {{being watched}} closely by the Special Administrative Region as well.

The political direction set by the decisions will have a large impact {{in the direction of}} Hong Kong's development in the coming years as well. Taiwan, which recently made another series of moves provoking Beijing, will pay attention to the 17th Congress due to the variations in the direction determined by the current leadership, even though it is very unlikely that China's Taiwan policy will change.|$|E

25|$|The supreme {{organ of}} the party is its congress, which is summoned by the {{outgoing}} central committee and held every four years. <b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> composed of delegates elected by the respective lower organs proportional to each organ's membership size. The congress approves its theses after a wide discussion period inside the organizations and may also change the party's programme and statutes. All {{the decisions of the}} congress are made by the delegates voting. With the exception of the voting for the central committee, which a recent Portuguese law requires to be secret, all voting, including the approval of the theses, are conducted by a show of hands. The theses, after approval, guide all the party's political actions and stances until the next congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party by Michel Aflaq (a Christian), Salah al-Din al-Bitar (a Sunni Muslim), and the {{followers}} of Zaki al-Arsuzi (an atheist) in Damascus, Syria, leading {{to the establishment of}} the Syrian Regional Branch. Other regional branches were established throughout the Arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s, in, among others, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Throughout its existence, the National Command (the body responsible for all-Arab affairs), gave most attention to Syrian affairs. The 2nd National Congress was convened in June 1954, and elected a seven-man National Command; Aflaq, Bitar, and Akram al-Hawrani were elected and represented the Syrian Regional Branch, while Abdullah Rimawi and Abdallah Na'was were elected to represent the Jordanian Branch. <b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> notable for sanctioning the merger of the Arab Socialist Movement and the Ba'ath Party, which took place in 1952.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>congress</b> <b>is</b> {{noteworthy}} {{because of}} the introduction of economic reforms, labelled Đổi Mới (Renovation), and {{the election of a}} new party leadership.

The Advisory Council to the Central Committee was established, and contained high-ranking officials who had retired at the 6th National Congress. The 6th National Congress emphasized the need to strengthen the [...] socialist mode of production.|$|E

The Secretariat had three members, one from the SAPD (Willy Brandt), one from the International Left Opposition (Heinz Epe) and one from the Socialist Party of Sweden.|$|R

500|$|Part Two {{describes}} {{the differences between}} the procedures of the military commissions and the procedures prescribed by the UCMJ (fewer jury members, different rules of evidence, etc.). [...] These differences demonstrate that the commissions do not operate under the rules of military courts-martial, and raise issues of neutrality with respect to the military judges involved. The negation of fairness safeguards renders the commission a judicial entity which is not a [...] "regularly constituted court", as required in the Geneva Convention. In sum, Kennedy writes that the commission exceeds congressional bounds, though <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> free to re-write the law as they see fit.|$|E
