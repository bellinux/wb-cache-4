In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac <b>troponin</b> C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to <b>troponin</b> C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in <b>troponin</b> complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac <b>troponin.</b> The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal <b>troponin</b> whereas it was invisible in the cardiac <b>troponin</b> crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in <b>troponin</b> during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|In cardiac muscle, cTnC binds to cardiac <b>troponin</b> I (cTnI) and cardiac <b>troponin</b> T (cTnT), whereas cTnC binds to slow {{skeletal}} <b>troponin</b> I (ssTnI) and <b>troponin</b> T (ssTnT) in slow-twitch skeletal muscle.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cardiac <b>troponins</b> are {{modified}} during {{ischemic injury}} and are found as a heterogeneous mix-ture in blood {{of patients with}} cardiovascular diseases. We present a strategy to isolate cardiac <b>troponins</b> from human biological material, by use of affinity chroma-tography, and to provide samples ready for direct anal-ysis by mass spectrometry. Methods: Cardiac <b>troponins</b> were isolated from human left ventricular tissue by affinity chromatography. Iso-lated <b>troponins</b> were either eluted and analyzed by Western blot or enzymatically digested while bound to affinity beads. The resulting peptide mixture was sub-jected to mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization. The same method was used to analyze serum from patients with acute myocardia...|$|R
50|$|Heart injury with {{increased}} <b>troponins</b> also occurs in cardiac contusion, defibrillation and {{internal or external}} cardioversion. <b>Troponins</b> are commonly increased in several procedures such as cardiac surgery and heart transplantation, closure of atrial septal defects, percutaneous coronary intervention, or radiofrequency ablation.|$|R

5|$|It is a tissue-specific subtype of <b>troponin</b> I, {{which in}} turn {{is a part of the}} <b>troponin</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. <b>Troponin</b> I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: <b>troponin</b> C, <b>troponin</b> T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of <b>troponin</b> C and induces conformational changes in <b>troponin</b> C and the <b>troponin</b> complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to bind cNTnC with low affinity and act as <b>troponin</b> activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to bind to cNTnC {{to act as a}} <b>troponin</b> inhibitor. All of these compounds bind to the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with <b>troponin</b> activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and <b>troponin</b> inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Troponins</b> {{are also}} {{increased}} {{in patients with}} heart failure, where they also predict mortality and ventricular rhythm abnormalities. They can rise in inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis and pericarditis with heart muscle involvement (which is then termed myopericarditis). <b>Troponins</b> can also indicate several forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or (left) ventricular hypertrophy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disorders such as cardiac amyloidosis.|$|R

40|$|<b>Troponins</b> have {{recently}} been promoted to playing {{a pivotal role in}} the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. However, a number of problems arise {{as a result of this}} “redefinition ” of acute MI The recent joint statement by the EuropeanSociety of Cardiology (ESC) and the Ameri-can College of Cardiology (ACC) proposing a “redefinition ” of myocardial infarction has aroused much interest but also sparked consider-able controversy. 1 The basis of the new definition is the promotion of <b>troponins</b> to a pivotal role in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, cou-pled with the relegation of creatine kinase (CK-MB) to a secondary role; and, in the case of total CK, to the realms of history. Elevation of <b>troponins</b> to centre stage in the drama of acute myocardial infarction is a direc...|$|R
5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} <b>troponin</b> {{activator}} {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a <b>troponin</b> inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. <b>Troponin</b> modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|<b>Troponin</b> I, cardiac {{muscle is}} a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI3 gene.|$|E
5|$|The TNNI3 gene {{encoding}} cardiac <b>troponin</b> I (cTnI) {{is located}} at 19q13.4 in the human chromosomal genome. Human cTnI is a 24 kDa protein consisting of 210 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 9.87. cTnI is exclusively expressed in adult cardiac muscle.|$|E
30|$|To date, {{investigations}} {{relating to}} early onset cardiotoxicity and cardiac <b>troponins</b> represent {{the bulk of}} published reports. The definition of cardiotoxicity in both studies {{was based on the}} Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee’s (CREC) criteria of drug-associated cardiotoxicity: a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 5 to < 55 % with symptoms of heart failure (HF) or an asymptomatic reduction of LVEF of ≥ 10 to < 55 % [4, 5, 24]. This is due to a strong association observed between high AC dosages (total cumulative dose of doxorubicin and its dose equivalent of ≥ 300  mg/m 2) and significant elevation of cardiac <b>troponins</b> in early onset cardiotoxicity [4, 5, 25]. Early increases in cardiac <b>troponins</b> (especially within 72  h of treatment) and persistent elevation can herald subsequent cardiac damage [4 – 6, 24]. In two studies by Cardinale et al. (n =  703) and Auner et al. (n =  78), a significant change between TnI and TnT was shown, each respectively with a significant drop in LVEF after 1 and 6  months after the start of treatment [26, 27]. While cardiac <b>troponins</b> may be useful indicators of cardiomyocyte injury, there are limitations in their reliability to predict cardiotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, subsequent HF, as well as overall prognosis.|$|R
50|$|Cardiac markers or {{cardiac enzymes}} are {{proteins}} that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Until the 1980s, the enzymes SGOT and LDH {{were used to}} assess cardiac injury. Now, the markers most widely used in detection of MI are MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac <b>troponins</b> T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac <b>troponins</b> T and I which are released within 4-6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage.Heart-type fatty acid binding protein is another marker, used in some home test kits.Elevated <b>troponins</b> in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future. New markers such as glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB are under investigation.|$|R
25|$|In acute-onset AF {{associated}} with chest pain, cardiac <b>troponins</b> or other markers {{of damage to}} the heart muscle may be ordered. Coagulation studies (INR/aPTT) are usually performed, as anticoagulant medication may be commenced.|$|R
5|$|There are {{specific}} proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and <b>troponin.</b> They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 {{that are also}} expressed in skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved. As homologous proteins, ssTnI, fast skeletal muscle TnI and cardiac TnI have highly conserved structures and crystallographic {{high resolution}} structure of partial cardiac and fast skeletal <b>troponin</b> complex are both available. Therefore, the structure-function relationship of ssTnI would {{rely on the}} information from studies performed on fast skeletal muscle and cardiac TnI.|$|E
5|$|<b>Troponin</b> I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{assumptions}} about elevations of macromolecular markers of myocardial injury in blood require critical consideration. The dichotomy of modest, persistent elevations of <b>troponins</b> I and T as prognostic factors {{in patients with}} unstable angina and absent elevations of isoenzymes of creatine kinase is presently unexplained. Factors influencing the appearance of macromolecular markers of myocardial injury in blood are considered, including the need to estimate baseline values, to consider elevations as deviations from baseline rather than simply points within a distribution of baseline values in normal subjects, to recognize operative biochemical and physiologic determinants of marker release from injured myocytes and washout and {{to take into account}} the influence of apoptosis. Elucidation and consideration of mechanisms underlying the appearance of specific macromolecular markers in blood appear likely to improve diagnosis and explain the prognostic power of the <b>troponins</b> in patients with unstable angina. Detection of proteolytic breakdown products of <b>troponins</b> in blood is likely to explain the modest, persistent elevations seen in some patients with unstable angina and their prognostic implications...|$|R

5|$|<b>Troponin</b> is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of <b>troponin</b> are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as aldolase, <b>troponin,</b> carbonic anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the <b>troponin</b> complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a literal {{explosion}} of studies examining cardiac biomarkers in heart failure (HF). 2 Among the many reasons for this fact is that measurements of such biomarkers as natriuretic pep-tides (the current gold standard biomarker for HF diagnosis, prognosis, and management decision-making) are easy and safe to obtain, and they can po-tentially reveal important information about the pa-tient at the biological level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the {{treatment}} of choice in large and staghorn renal stones, and myocardial infarction is one the possible complications {{during and after the}} surgery. We investigated if renal and skeletal muscle injury, caused by percutaneous nephrolithotomy, can cause elevation in cardiac <b>troponins</b> (cTn). METHODS: This study was conducted on otherwise healthy patients with renal stone undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy. A baseline 12 -lead electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and cTn assessment confirmed no cardiac pathology in any patients. Cardiac <b>troponins</b> T (cTnT) and I (cTnI), and also creatine kinase (CK) were assessed before and after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients (69. 1 % males, mean age: 40. 5 ± 13. 8 year) were included. Serum creatinine level ranged from 0. 7 to 1. 3 mg/dl (mean = 1. 03 ± 0. 17). The level of CK was significantly increased by 469. 5 ± 201. 4 U/l (P < 0. 001), and no positive cTnT or cTnI was observed after surgery.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The role of {{biomarkers}} such as B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP and NT-proBNP) and <b>troponins</b> in {{risk stratification}} of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is still debated. A meta-analysis {{was performed to}} assess the association between raised natriuretic peptide levels, alone or in conjunction with <b>troponins,</b> and all-cause and APE-related mortality, serious adverse events and echographic right ventricular dysfunction. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched and conference abstracts were hand searched up to February 2008. Studies were included if a 2 x 2 table could be constructed based on natriuretic peptide results {{and at least one}} of the outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included (1127 patients). Raised natriuretic peptide levels were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 6. 2; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 0 to 12. 7), APE-related mortality (OR 5. 0; 95 % CI 2. 2 to 11. 5) and serious adverse events (OR 6. 7; 95 % CI 3. 9 to 11. 6), with homogeneity across studies. Among patients with raised natriuretic peptide levels, increased serum <b>troponins</b> were associated with a further increase in the risk of adverse outcomes. Analysis of the accuracy of natriuretic peptides in detecting right ventricular dysfunction was limited by heterogeneity across studies. BNP appeared to have better sensitivity and specificity than NT-proBNP in detecting right ventricular dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Raised levels of B-type natriuretic peptides identified a subset of patients with APE at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Among patients with raised natriuretic peptide levels, increased <b>troponins</b> were found to be an independent prognostic marker.
