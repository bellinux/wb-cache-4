40|$|The AD 8494 {{thermocouple}} amplifier includes an on-chip temperature sensor, normally used for cold-junction compensation, allowing {{the device to}} be used as a standalone Celsius thermometer by grounding the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>inputs.</b> In this configuration, the amplifier produces a 5 -mV/°C output voltage between the output and (the normally grounded) reference pins of the on-chip instrumentation amplifier. One drawback of this approach is the poor system resolution achieved when measuring narrow temperature ranges. Consider this: a 10 -bit ADC running on a single 5 -V supply has 4. 88 -mV/LSB resolution. This means that the system shown in Figure 1 has a resolution of about 1 °C/LSB. If the temperature range of interest is narrow, say 20 °C, the output varies by 100 mV, utilizing only 1 / 50 of the ADC’s available dynamic range. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} dynamic {{thermocouple}} compensation is considered. Taking {{into account the}} nonlinear dependency of the thermocouple time constant on fluid velocity, a thermocouple model and a time constant model are proposed successively for estimation of nonlinear thermocouple time constant. This technique is most suitable for measuring dynamic temperature because of the precise description of time constant. The improve scheme offers better compensation of the thermocouple response. The parameter estimation is performed using GTLS {{to cope with the}} noise present on the regressors and the output. Instruction In many industrial applications, thermocouples are used due to their high credibility and good linear dependence with temperature. However there are drawbacks of thermocouples, the most important of which is inaccuracy of measuring high frequency temperature fluctuations [1]. So, by establishment of the dynamic model, <b>thermocouple</b> <b>input</b> can be reconstructed. In general, thermocouple was model as a first order nonlinear model. Time constant is the undetermined parameter of the model. As the present research，a fixed (mean) time constant [2] is almost always used, although it is variable in fluctuating velocity and thermal field. The simplification of th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThermal {{radiation}} sensors {{are based}} on two signal transduction stages: radiation to thermal and thermal to electrical. The most common of these sensors are the radiation thermocouple using the Seebeck effect and the bolometer applying the thermoresistive effect. While the bolometer requires a bias current for signal generation the thermocouple is generally operated unbiased. The paper theoretically investigates a biased thermocouple instead, which {{can be thought of}} as a combination of both thermal radiation sensor types. Its responsivity and detectivity is calculated based on previous theories of the performance of bolometers and radiation thermocouples, respectively, thereby including the Peltier effect. The electrical resistance and thermal conductance of the <b>thermocouple</b> as <b>input</b> parameters for these calculations are modeled using a simple strip geometry to facilitate one-dimensional analytical electrothermal modeling...|$|R
30|$|The commercially {{available}} vortex tube (adjustable cold air gun, ITW Vortec Ltd.) is a compact and simple mechanical device {{that can produce}} cold air at different temperatures and flow rates from a stream of compressed gas without any moving parts, chemical reactions, or external energy supply. The source of compressed air was either medical air cylinders supplied by L’Air Liquide Ltd. (St. Thomas, ON, CA), with a capacity of 6569  L at fill pressure of 15, 617  kPa downregulated to 344  kPa, or a hospital medical air outlet at fixed outlet pressure of 344  kPa. High-pressure compressed air from either source {{was applied to the}} inlet nozzle of an electropneumatic pressure regulator (PULSTRONIC II series 605, Numatics Inc.) to monitor and precisely regulate the pressure of compressed air before entering the vortex tube. The compressed air then passed through a generation chamber (inside the vortex tube) which created the vortices inside the tube and caused the compressed air flow to be separated into a cold and a hot stream traveling in opposite directions in the tube. The fraction of compressed air exiting as cold air (also referred as cold fraction ratio) was adjusted by a throttle needle valve via a stepper motor (IMDE 17 -M Integrated Motor/Driver, RMS Technologies Inc., NV, USA). Both temperature and flow rate of the cold air stream were controlled and monitored continuously by a microprocessor-based digital controller that included a feedback system (Atmel’s AVR Microcontroller, ATmega 64 A 8 -bit with 64 K bytes in-system programmable flash). It automatically regulated the inlet pressure and fraction ratio based on the desired cold output air temperature and flow rate from the vortex tube to tightly control the brain temperature and rewarming rate throughout the experiments. Moreover, the temperature of air exiting the cold air outlet of the vortex tube was monitored and recorded continuously with a thermometer (Thermometer/Data Logger, HH 309 A, with Four Type K <b>Thermocouple</b> <b>Inputs,</b> Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT; resolution 0.1  °C). Intranasal brain cooling was achieved by connecting two nasal catheters (made from polyvinyl chloride, PVC) to the tube from the cold air outlet of a vortex tube. The catheters were coated with 2  % lidocaine gel for local anesthesia and ensuring their better contact with turbinates in the nasal cavity and were inserted 8 – 10  cm into each nostril. A thermistor was also placed inside one of the two nasal catheters to monitor temperature inside the nasal cavity throughout the experiments. Figure  1 shows the schematic of the experimental setup.|$|R

The inclination angles were changed from 0 0 - 45 0 angles with steps of 15 degrees. The experiments were carried on specially developed facility to perform constant heat flux and the temperatures were measured by <b>thermocouples.</b> The electrical <b>input</b> to the heater {{was controlled by}} dimmer stat and is measured by wattmeter. The experiments are carried for Rayleigh no (Ra) from 4. 5 x 10 4 to 8. 5 x 10 8. The effects of array inclination and Rayleigh number on the temperature distribution were investigated. The local Rayleigh numbers and Nusselt numbers (Nu) were estimated along the tube length. The experimental results show that for higher values of Rayleigh numbers and higher inclination angles the temperature differences from the tube to atmosphere air decreases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Calibration is an {{important}} operation in the instrumentation industry for determining {{the relationship between the}} output(s) (or response) of a measuring instrument and the value of the input(s). This paper proposes a nonlinear calibration method based on least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) with the output voltage of <b>thermocouple</b> sensor as <b>input</b> and the measured temperature output to eliminate the nonlinear errors in detection process. Firstly, the nonlinear calibrator, expressed by power series, was established based on the principle of inverse model. And then the parameters of the calibrator were identified by LS-SVR. Through this calibrator, the desired linear characteristics of thermocouple sensor could be obtained. Finally, platinum-rhodium 30 – platinum-rhodium 6 -thermocouple (B-type) was taken as an example, and experimental results show that the proposed calibration method is efficient in the temperature range from 400 ℃ to 1800 ℃. And the method has an advantage of analytical expression of the calibration model...|$|R
40|$|A {{steady state}} {{model of a}} {{thermoelectric}} heat pump fitted with pin fin heat exchange surfaces is developed from the equations governing the operation of a thermoelectric device and pressure drop/ heat transfer correlations for staggered tube banks in cross flow. The model computes current draw, heat pumped at the cold side, heat rejected at the hot side, hot and cold side exhaust temperatures, and hot and cold side pin base temperatures when given the following parameters: ambient temperature, thermoelectric geometry factor, number of <b>thermocouple</b> junctions, <b>input</b> voltage, pin diameter, pin height, transverse pin stagger, longitudinal pin stagger, contact resistance between the thermoelectric modules and the heat ex change surfaces, and fan performance curves for the hot and cold sides. Results of a FIDAP numerical model of a 4 row heated pin system are presented and compared to the heat transfer and pressure drop correlations chosen {{for use in the}} model. Nine tests were run with a working thermoelectric heat pump unit under various air flow and voltage input to collect data for the purpose of comparison with the model. Using empirically determined contact resistance values, the model predicted Qc (heat pumped from the cold side) values that agreed with experiment within about 10 %, Qh (heat rejected from the hot side) values that agreed with experiment within about 5 %, and current draw values that agreed with experiment with in about 5 %. Further examination of the contact resistance values suggested the presence of an undesirable air gap at the heat sink/thermoelectric module interface. The presence of this air gap was confirmed by examining the contact patterns left on pressure sensitive films that were placed between the thermoelectric modules and the heat sinks. An optimization exercise was performed with the model in an effort to maximize Qc. Pin geometry was varied to achieve minimum values of heat sink thermal resistance for both the hot and cold side heat exchange surfaces. Using these minimized thermal resistance values, input voltage, thermo electric geometry factor, and number of thermocouple junctions were varied to achieve maximum Qc. Using the empirically determined thermal contact resistance values, a 29 % increase in Qc was achieved over the stock case. The model predicted a 79 % improvement over the stock case when utilizing thermal contact resistance values corresponding to the elimination of the air gaps at the thermoelectric module/heat sink interfaces...|$|R
