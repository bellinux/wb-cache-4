5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest between East Pakistanis and the central government <b>trigged</b> the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh.

5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall <b>trigged</b> a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} announced to restructure Pakistan International Airlines, which flies routes around the world, including to North America. PIA has already {{put out a}} tender to lease new aircraft, to improve its capacity and save fuel with more-efficient planes. As part of the restructuring, PIA has been split into two companies. A holding group would retain some 250billion rupees in debt and excess personnel, and a [...] "new" [...] PIA would hold the lucrative landing rights and new aircraft. Afterward, the government plans to sell a 26% stake in that new PIA to a strategic partner. In February 2016, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) is to be converted into a public limited company as Pakistan International Airlines Company Limited (PIACL) {{to make way for}} privatisation, however this <b>trigged</b> eight-day long union strike.

The prime minister Janša proposed his dismissal because statements about how to rise fertility in country. Many were also discontented with his work. Marjeta Cotman replaced him on the position. The change of Janez Drobnič <b>trigged</b> a mini coalition crisis as there were many ministers people and Janša were displeased with, among them also Dragotin Mate (poor treatment with Roma minority in Slovenia), Dimitrij Rupel (The Economist marked his diplomatic capabilities as [...] "clumsy"), Jure Zupan , Marija Lukačič (incompetence and difficulties with communication with the media) and Vasko Simoniti {{who at the time}} recently [...] "survived" [...] interpelation.|$|E
50|$|Moisture stress {{also has}} an effect on stomatal {{openings}} of a plant, mainly causing a closure in stomata as {{to reduce the amount of}} carbon dioxide assimilation. Closing of the stomata also slows the rate of transpiration, which limits water loss and helps to prevent the wilting effects of moisture stress. This closing can be <b>trigged</b> by the roots sensing dry soil and in response producing the hormone ABA which when transported up the xylem into the leaves will reduce stomatal conductance and wall extensibility of growing cells. This lowers the rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and leaf expansion. ABA also increases the loosening of growing root cell walls and in turn increases root growth in an effort to find water in the soil.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, rather than {{undertake}} more traditional cost-cutting measures, McCardell pressed for concessions from the United Auto Workers (a trade union which had represented Harvester's workers since the early 1950s). McCardell's inexperience at labor relations, his rigid bargaining stance, misjudgments about the union's ability to withstand a long strike, and other factors <b>trigged</b> a 172-day strike which began on November 1, 1979, and ended on April 20, 1980. The strike was the longest ever at International Harvester, and as of August 2008 is still the fourth-longest strike in United Auto Worker history. When a final agreement came, the union retained nearly everything McCardell had sought to change, and International Harvester had lost $479.4 million during the strike and $397.3 million in the next fiscal year.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Battle of Austerlitz and the War of the Third Coalition, Napoleon {{dissolved}} the Holy Roman Empire, annexed {{parts of}} Austria and certain German states to France, and formed the German states into the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon was their [...] "protector," [...] {{but as the}} Confederation was above all a military alliance, their foreign policy was utterly dominated by France, and the states had to supply France {{with large numbers of}} military troops. Disquiet about mass-conscription (the levée en masse) also <b>trigged</b> an uprising, known as the Peasants' War, in 1798 within modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg. In Germany, Napoleon formed two new states, the Grand Duchy of Berg and the Kingdom of Westphalia, which he gave to his brothers Joachim Murat and Jerome Bonaparte respectively. The Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège were annexed and became départements of France.|$|E
50|$|The third game, {{postponed}} {{a day by}} rain—the postponement <b>trigged</b> a rhubarb between A.L. President Joe Cronin and A's President Charlie Finley—was {{played at}} Oakland and produced a brilliant pitching battle between a pair of southpaws, Mike Cuellar of Baltimore and Ken Holtzman. Up to that point, Cuellar had allowed only three hits. he had a one-hit shutout for the first seven innings as he carefully nursed a 1-0 lead given him by Earl Williams' homer in the second inning. But in the eighth, pinch-hitter Jesús Alou singled and pinch-runner Allan Lewis was sacrificed to second by Mike Andrews. The play was controversial in that Cuellar appeared to have a force out at second base, but he ignored catcher Etchebarren's yells and took the safe out at first. This proved costly as, one out later, Joe Rudi singled home Lewis to tie the score.|$|E
50|$|Yet in 1533, Cherkasy hetman Ostafiy Dashkovich {{proposed}} {{to build a}} fortress {{on one of the}} islands behind the Dnipro cascade to prevent the Tartar raids. His idea was put into life only in the mid of the 16th century by another Cherkasy and Kaniv headman prince Bayda Vyshnevetskyi, who built the fortification on the island Mala Chortytsya - the prototype of the legendary Zaporozhian Sich.The Lithuanian-Polish period was marked by the land concentration in the hands of nobility and the introduction of the frillwork system, that presupposed turning peasants into serfs. The wheat grown on Ukrainian fields and the potash produced out of Ukrainian wood were the main sources of the feudal prosperity. In cities industry specialization <b>trigged</b> the emergence of first trade unions called Tsekhy. At last in 1584 the Magdeburg Law was granted to Korsun’, in 1592 - to Chyhyryn, and in 1600 - to Kaniv.|$|E

50|$|Wilson {{made his}} Morecambe debut {{for the second}} time of his career, in a 3-0 win over Dagenham & Redbridge in the opening game of the season. After missing one game in the follow up, due to the club’s {{rotation}} that left him out of the starting eleven, he returned to the first team on 19 August 2011, in a 1-0 win over Oxford United in the follow up match. However, Wilson’s return was short-lived when he suffered an ankle ligament injury during a 2-1 win over Cambridge United on 23 August 2014. After two months with an injury, he returned to training in mid-October and returned to the first team from injury, in a 2-0 loss against Exeter City on 26 October 2014. He then scored his first goal for the club on 7 March 2015, in a 3-2 win over Luton Town. Despite suffering an injury during the 2014-15 season, Wilson went on to make thirty-six appearances and scoring once in all competitions. At the end of the 2014-15 season, Wilson was awarded for the Goal of the Season, which was against Luton Town on 7 March 2015 and earned himself a contract extension after being <b>trigged</b> for another season.|$|E
50|$|Winds were {{recorded}} up to 101 km/h (63 mph) in the United States Marine base. Damage {{at the base}} was primarily limited to trees. The storm passed directly over Kumejima Island, producing a record 226 km/h (140.5 mph) wind gust on the island. A pressure of 948.4 hPa (mbar) was recorded as the eye passed over. This record was eclipsed {{less than two weeks}} later by Typhoon Wipha which produced a wind gust of 252 km/h (156.6 mph). Total precipitation in Okinawa was estimated to have reached 120 mm (6 in), with rainfall rates peaking at 45.5 mm (1.8 in) per hour. At least 4,500 residences were left without power throughout all the islands, most of which were on Kumejima. In Naha City, a wall collapsed due to the rain but caused no injuries. Cars were reportedly flipped over in Kumejima Town where the worst damage was dealt. Numerous buildings lost their windows and numerous trees were knocked down. The outer bands of Nari <b>trigged</b> flooding which killed three people and injured three others in Kyushu. Fourteen homes were destroyed, 22 were damaged, and 117 others were affected. A total of 1,247 hectares of farmland was either damaged or destroyed by the typhoon. At the height of the storm, 4,800 households were without power and 3,700 were without water. Damages from both prefectures amounted to ¥31.4 billion ($323 million USD).|$|E
50|$|The Gold Coast Titans {{began the}} season with a come-from-behind 24-18 victory against the New Zealand Warriors at home. A golden point win over Souths {{followed}}, in what was a long match that didn't finish until around 11:30pm Queensland time (10:30pm Sydney time; as the match kicked off at 8:30pm). A 24-4 win over the Canberra Raiders at home followed before the Titans lost its first match of the season against the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville. The Titans bounced back a week later to beat the Melbourne Storm at home before stumbling against the St. George Illawarra Dragons in round six. The Titans then had a three-match winning streak before stumbling against rivals Brisbane in round ten, the Sydney Roosters in round 12 and the Canberra Raiders in round 13. The Titans got back on track with a 28-14 win over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at home, which was backed up with a win over the Bulldogs in round 15 before an unexpected defeat against the Newcastle Knights at home the following round. This <b>trigged</b> the Titans' second three-match losing streak in the season, however the Titans would emerge from their form slump and the dreaded State of Origin period with a golden point 11-10 victory over the Dragons at Kogarah where neither of the Gold Coast franchises had never won. They would lose only one more game {{for the rest of the}} regular season, against battlers Cronulla in Cronulla in the penultimate round of the season in what was also Greg Bird's return to the Shire since the Sharks sacked him in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The Select Committee focused its {{attention}} {{for most of}} 1957 on the Teamsters union. Teamsters President Dave Beck fled {{the country for a}} month to avoid its subpoenas before returning in March 1957. The Select Committee had a difficult time investigating the Teamsters. Four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny, several Teamster staffers provided verbal testimony which differed substantially from their prior written statements (the Select Committee eventually charged six of them with contempt of Congress), and union records were lost or destroyed (allegedly on purpose). But, working with the FBI, the Select Committee electrified the nation when on February 22, 1957, wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which Dio and Hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals, including the establishment of a paper local to organize New York City's 30,000 taxi cab drivers and use the charter as a means of extorting money {{from a wide variety of}} employers. The 1957 hearings opened with a focus on corruption in Portland, Oregon, and featured the testimony of Portland crime boss Jim Elkins. With the support of 70 hours of taped conversations, Elkins described being approached by two Seattle gangsters about working with the Teamsters to take over Portland vice operations. The colorful testimony brought the committee's investigations national media attention from the outset. As 1.2 million viewers watched on live television, evidence was unearthed over the next few weeks of a mob-sponsored plot in which Oregon Teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature, state police, and state attorney general's office through bribery, extortion and blackmail. On March 14, 1957, Jimmy Hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe an aide to the Select Committee. Hoffa denied the charges (and was later acquitted), but the arrest <b>trigged</b> additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks. Less than a week later, Beck admitted to receiving an interest-free $300,000 loan from the Teamsters which he had never repaid, and Select Committee investigators claimed that loans to Beck and other union officials (and their businesses) had cost the Teamsters more than $700,000. Beck appeared before the Select Committee for the first time on March 25, 1957, and notoriously invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 117 times. Beck was called before the McClellan Committee again in May 1957, and additional interest-free loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed. Based on these revelations, Beck was indicted for tax evasion on May 2, 1957.|$|E
