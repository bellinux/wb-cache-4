5000|$|In {{his book}} Anarchism: Arguments For and Against, Albert Meltzer argues: Commonsense shows that any {{capitalist}} society might dispense with a 'State' [...] [...] [...] {{but it could}} not dispense with organised government, or a privatised form of it, if there were people amassing money and others working to amass it for them. The philosophy of 'anarcho-capitalism' dreamed up by the 'libertarian' New Right, {{has nothing to do}} with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper. It is a lie [...] [...] [...] Patently unbridled capitalism [...] [...] [...] needs some force at its disposal to maintain class privileges, either from the State itself or from private armies. What <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>is</b> in fact a limited State -- that is, one in which the State has one function, to protect the ruling class, does not interfere with exploitation, and comes as cheap as possible for the ruling class. The idea also serves another purpose [...] [...] [...] a moral justification for bourgeois consciences in avoiding taxes without feeling guilty about it.|$|E

40|$|Teachers’ Beliefs and Practice in the Linguistics Classroom Abstract Teaching {{refers to}} all the {{activities}} that are intended to bring about language learning. Teaching does not only include teacher’s skills and knowledge, rather it includes even their beliefs. It {{has been argued that}} teachers’ beliefs are stronger that their knowledge. Teachers’ beliefs include their beliefs about their learners, learning and about themselves as persons. But do teachers preach what they teach? in order words, “ Do teachers’ practice what they believe in?” and “ Is there a discrepancy between what teachers do and what they think they do in their classrooms? A study has been conducted with teachers of first year linguistics in the department of  English-Badji Mokhtar University- Annaba. First year linguistics aims at developing learners’ background knowledge and awareness of certain terminology related to this field of study.

While at the play Renoir noticed Nora Gregor in a box seat in the audience and asked about her during the intermission.

Renoir became friends with Gregor and her husband, getting to know them over several dinners <b>in</b> Paris.

A visible gun in a car poses a direct risk to the officer, and when a patrol officer notices a gun in a car, the nature of the interaction immediately changes. They can take a wide variety of steps, ranging from drawing their own weapon if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> imminent danger to calmly noting the presence of a gun to the driver and asking if they have a permit.
