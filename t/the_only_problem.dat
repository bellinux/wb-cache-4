The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became {{the first person to}} sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events.

5|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> he found {{was how he}} often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said {{he was one of}} the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits and his ability to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise.|$|E

A new company named after Pilcher formed to take over the assets of the Missouri Fur Company, and it quickly withdrew from all former Missouri Fur Company posts above Council Bluff.

25|$|Barbary slaves {{could hope}} to be freed through payment of a ransom. Despite the efforts of {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem.</b> Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and tell them the ransom price. Mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} the two concepts, {{both of these}} problems could be eliminated. Since phase comparison is generally more accurate at low frequencies, taking accurate fixes {{would be based on}} this technique. But instead of broadcasting a continuous signal, {{as in the case of}} Decca, the signal would be in the form of pulses. These would be used to make a rough fix using the same technique as Gee or LORAN, positively identifying the lane, and then a phase comparison would be used to take a more accurate measurement. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> from a development standpoint would be selecting frequencies that allowed reasonably accurate pulse envelopes while still having measurable waveforms within the pulses, as well as developing displays capable of showing both the pulses as a whole, and the waves within them.|$|E
25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> {{was that they were}} often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E

50|$|By 1986, {{there were}} 110 {{national}} monuments, memorials, and statues in Washington, D.C., and its immediate environs. The pressure {{to build more}} memorials on the National Mall was extremely heavy, with roughly 15 new proposals being introduced in each session of Congress. Approximately 25 additional memorials had been seriously proposed but lacked a congressional sponsor to introduced authorizing legislation in Congress. The sheer number of memorials being proposed was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>problems.</b> <b>The</b> memorials were increasingly large, and often included extensive exhibits that threatened to turn memorials into miniature museums.|$|R
25|$|Another major {{attraction}} is the Bosque de los Arboles de Navidad (Christmas Tree Forest), {{one of the}} few places in Mexico where one can go and cut his/her own tree. The Bosque plants trees such as the “vikingo mexiquense” and the “vikingo canadiense” coming here has become a tradition for many families in the Mexico City area. It is a business that was conceived forty years ago as a way to help preserve the forest here as well as benefit economically. Visitors come to spend a day in the area and can cut trees only from designated locations. Picnicking is permitted with the requirement that no garbage is left behind. The Christmas tree area covers 300 acres (120 hectares), and cut trees are left to regrow instead of being killed. The park also hosts food stalls and a Christmas market, selling about 30,000 trees per year and employing 50 permanent and 250 seasonal workers.The money earned from the enterprise helps to preserve more wild areas of the mountains here. This work has earned a Premio Nacional de Ecología (National Ecology Prize). <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> the forest experiences is that the enterprise is so popular that the roads leading to the area are jammed with traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E
