In the present study, a significant differences in the percent <b>of</b> <b>Kerosene</b> degrading fungi were evident among the time of biodegradation. The growth profiles were determined by monitoring growth ability in (potato dextrose agar PDA) medium containing 0. 0, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % v/v Kerosene, dry weights and pH <b>of</b> utilizing <b>Kerosene</b> as carbon and energy source were determined. There was no significant in dry weights of fungi at the 7 days of incubation. A. niger had the highest dry weight value of 0. 530 gm in 10 % concentration while R. stolinifer had the low dry weight value of 0. 522 gm. The pH values decreased in a fungal cells metabolized after 28 days of incubation. R. stolinifer had the highest pH value of 6. 3 after 28 days incubation, but A. niger had the lowest PH of 4. 6 on Kerosene and there was no significant. The ability of fungi to degrade Kerosene was measured directly by determination the residual Kerosene by FTIR Spectroscopy and indirectly by gravimetric estimation <b>of</b> residual <b>Kerosene</b> left after biodegradation was made by weighing the quantity <b>of</b> <b>Kerosene</b> in a tared flask.

40|$|Objective: Kerosene is {{commonly}} available {{in many parts}} of the developing world where it is used as fuel for lighting and cooking purposes. Toxic effects of large quantities <b>of</b> <b>kerosene</b> have been reported but there is dearth of data on impact of trace amount <b>of</b> <b>kerosene</b> on mammals. Exposure through either the dermal or oral route is common among humans (kerosene retailers). The aim of the study is to determine the degree of oxidative damage that can result from dermal or oral exposure to trace amount <b>of</b> <b>kerosene.</b> This will be accomplished by utilizing oxidative-stress markers like antioxidant enzymes and product of lipid peroxidation as indices of the study. Methods: Using spectrometric techniques; levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured. Results: Administration of rats with 0. 4 ml/kg b. wt <b>of</b> <b>kerosene</b> for a period of thirty days resulted in significant decreases in either the level or activities of antioxidants (Zn, Cu, Mn, GSH, antioxidant enzymes) and significant increases in the levels of products of oxidation (MDA, GSSG).

Therefore steps should be taken to discourage constant exposure to kerosene. [J Exp Integr Med 2013; 3 (1) : 31 - 36...|$|R
