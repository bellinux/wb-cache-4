5000|$|The new {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by William Douglass and built {{under the supervision of}} James Kavanagh. Construction started in 1897 with the levelling of the site, and the first of 2,047 Cornish granite dovetailed blocks was laid in June 1899. As well as these blocks, weighing 4,300 tons in total and with a volume of , a further [...] of granite was used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of the tower up {{to the level of the}} entrance floor 58 ft above high-water mark. A small steamship, the Ierne, was specially constructed for carrying the blocks out to the island, and Kavanagh personally set every stone, which weighed between 1¾ and 3 tons. The new lighthouse entered service on 27 June 1904 having cost nearly £90,000.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe human {{rhinovirus}} 14 (HRV 14) protomer, with {{or without}} the antiviral compound WIN 52084 s, was simulated using molecular dynamics and rotational symmetry boundary conditions to model the effect of the entire icosahedral capsid. The protein asymmetrical unit, comprising four capsid proteins (VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, and VP 4) and two calcium ions, was solvated both on the exterior and the interior <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of the capsid. The stability of the simulations of this large system (∼ 800 residues and 6, 650 water molecules) is comparable to more conventional globular protein simulations. The influence of the antiviral compound on compressibility and positional fluctuations is reported. The compressibility, estimated from the density fluctuations in the region of the binding pocket, was found to be greater with WIN 52084 s bound than without the drug, substantiating previous computations on reduced viral systems. An increase in compressibility correlates with an entropically more favorable system. In contrast to the increase in density fluctuations and compressibility, the positional fluctuations decreased dramatically for the external loops of VP 1 and the N-terminus of VP 3 when WIN 52084 s is bound. Most of these VP 1 and VP 3 loops are found near the fivefold axis, a region whose mobility was not considered in reduced systems, but can be observed with this simulation of the full viral protomer. Altered loop flexibility is consistent with changes in proteolytic sensitivity observed experimentally. Moreover, decreased flexibility in these intraprotomeric loops is noteworthy since the externalization of VP 4, part of VP 1, and RNA during the uncoating process is thought to involve areas near the fivefold axis. Both the decrease in positional fluctuations at the fivefold axis and the increase in compressibility near the WIN pocket are discussed in relationship to the antiviral activity of stabilizing the virus against uncoating...|$|E

Using a survey of establishments with information on a white collar job currently held by an older worker, the paper tests hypotheses on what types of jobs are likely <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> from <b>the</b> outside.

40|$|AbstractArchitectural {{heritage}} conservation {{is an important}} field in architectural research. The Hui-style vernacular dwelling is an essential architectural heritage of China. Its hollow wall system, with horsehead-like upper corners, is a distinct architectural feature that is worth preserving. However, the thermal performance of the hollow wall is relatively poor by today's standard. The current study developed a novel approach, whereby foam concrete was used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> voids <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> hollow wall to improve its thermal resistance. This approach was deemed cost effective, easy to learn, and capable of preserving the architectural integrity of the wall. Different types of foam concrete were prepared and tested. Testing {{results showed that the}} material properties of foam concrete are suitable for thermally upgrading the hollow wall system. Climate chamber testing was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed thermal upgrading strategy. The testing results suggested that <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> voids with foam concrete can effectively improve the overall thermal resistance of the hollow wall system by 24 %, which is almost equal to the overall thermal resistance when using the more expensive commercial inorganic stucco system...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{application of}} model based development techniques {{in the design}} of real-time systems comprises usually the generation of code from both structural and behavioral models. This work describes recent advances in a toolaided methodology that enables the assembly and transformation of such design intended models into schedulability analysis models that match the corresponding automatically generated implementation code. Both, the analysis models and the code are generated by means of model transformations from the high-level architectural formalisms provided by the UML Profile for MARTE standard. As a novelty the Ada code generator uses not only the typical information provided in structural models, which is used to create the skeleton of the classes and procedures, but also its activities, whose scenario based behavioral information is used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> code <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> procedures and functions there contained. From the perspective of the real-time practitioner, the use of activities instead of state machines helps significantly to keep in tune the two fundamental views of the system: the implementation code, and its corresponding schedulability analysis model...|$|R

50|$|Like most {{paintings}} of the Romantic era, the painting has many underlying symbolic meanings.

On the windowsill, potted plants symbolize the different stages of growth of human life - for Romantic painters the image of creative Genius was often symbolized by a plant or flowers growing from a seed into a big plant that develops towards the sky, having its own cycle of life, setting seeds of its own, nourished by water and light.

30|$|Masonry {{walls and}} {{concrete}} blocks {{have long been}} used in construction, and much {{research has been conducted}} on them in other countries. Recently, Jonaitis and Zavalis (2013) conducted a test to determine the compression behavior of an empty concrete block and of another block filled with grouted concrete. A fracture was found on the mortar joint of the empty concrete block, and as such, an increase in compression stress caused lateral deformation. Furthermore, it was discovered that <b>the</b> concrete block <b>filled</b> with grouted concrete showed a compression behavior similar to that of cast-in-place concrete. Shing et al. (1989) evaluated the fracture mechanism, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of shear block walls through the cyclic loading test to determine their nonlinear behavior. Based on the test results, he reported that through seismic retrofit by using shear block walls, a resistance capacity to shear and ductility could be acquired to some degree. Zhai and Stewart (2010) presented a new theoretical equation with the material strength, types of live load, the ratio of dead load to live load, and the combination of the eccentricity and concentric load as parameters to establish the safety guideline for reinforced block walls in China, and verified the appropriateness of the equation through tests. In Japan, form blocks are widely used in new construction projects where only grouted concrete used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> hollow zones <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> blocks would be considered to provide sufficient strength, and blocks would be considered to function only as a form (Architecture Institute of Japan 2006).|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of fluid phenomena is of high {{interest in the}} management of cryogenic liquid propellants used in heavy-lift launchers. In order to efficiently design orbital cryogenic propellant storage facilities or cryogenic propulsion systems experiments concerning fill-levels, bubble formations and boiling have to be conducted in microgravity and on earth. Thus measurement devices are needed that can give insight into the spatial distribution and the behavior of <b>the</b> fluids <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cryogenic system. One possibility to observe liquids inside a given volume without intruding into the system and thereby disturbing the flow characteristics is to use a capacitive system with electrodes embedded into the walls of the vessel. In this paper experiments with such a system at cryogenic temperatures are presented. To simulate the behavior of rocket fuel in space a cryostat was filled with liquid nitrogen and by way of controlling <b>the</b> pressure <b>inside</b> or locally heating the liquid bubbles were created. Two capacitive measurement systems have been submerged into the cryogenic liquid to monitor the location and size of bubbles <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> liquid and to observe the state of the liquid/gas interface. One system consisted of a cylindrical polycarbonate ring with four embedded electrodes and a polycarbonate lid at the top carrying one ring-shaped electrode. Many small bubbles thus could be trapped and coalesced in this half closed cylinder (bubble trap) forming a big single gas volume. The other system was a polycarbonate ring with 16 electrodes arranged along its circumference. The task of these systems was <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> level <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cylindrical bubble trap and to detect and quantify rising bubbles <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cryostat by measuring the mutual capacitances of selected electrode pairs. To interpret the measurement results, FEM simulation results were used to generate a characteristic curve for <b>the</b> relationship between <b>filling</b> level and measured capacitances. To validate the results, two cameras were mounted <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cryostat which allowed the simultaneous recording of <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> level and <b>the</b> existence of bubbles and bubble streams. We observed a good agreement between measurement and simulation. Overall the suitability of the system for cryogenic applications has been successfully demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes several {{techniques to}} improve performance and controllability of large-scale rigid body simulations. We first describe a statistical simulation method that replaces certain stages of rigid body simulation with a statistically- based approximation. We begin by collecting statistical data regarding changes in linear and angular momentum for collisions of a given object. From the data, we extract a statistical ?signature? for the object, giving a compact representation of the object?s response to collision events. During object simulation, both the collision detection and the collision response calculations are replaced by simpler calculations based on the statistical signature. In addition, based on our statistical simulator, we develop a mixed rigid body simulator that combines an impulse-based with a statistically-based collision response method. This allows us to maintain high accuracy in important parts of the scene while achieving greater efficiency by simplifying less important parts of the simulation. The resulting system gives speedups of more than {{an order of magnitude}} on several large rigid body simulations while maintaining high accuracy in key places and capturing overall statistical behavior in other places. Also, we introduce two methods for directing pile behavior to form <b>the</b> desired shapes. <b>To</b> <b>fill</b> up <b>the</b> space <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> desired shapes and maintain the stability of the desired pile shapes, our methods analyze the configurations and status of all objects and properly select some candidates to have their degrees of freedom (DOFs) reduced. Our first method utilizes the idea of angles of repose to perform the analysis. According to the desired angle of repose, we create an additional spatial structure to track the piling status and select suitable objects to reduce their DOFs. In our second method, we adapt equilibrium analysis in a local scheme to find ?stable? objects of the stacking structure. Then, we restrict their DOFs by adding constraints on them for stabilizing the structure. Overall, our directing methods generate a wider variety of piled structures than possible with strict physically-based simulation...|$|R
