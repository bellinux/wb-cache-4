500|$|There was {{speculation}} among {{fans that}} the murdered {{old man in}} the short could be Ben Parker, the uncle of Marvel character Spider-Man who is killed by a mugger {{as part of that}} hero's origin story. The speculation noted the way the old man is killed in the short, {{and the fact that he}} is carrying Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In response to this, Leitch [...] "coyly" [...] said, [...] "That's a really interesting question", and adding, [...] "I think that people should continue to theorize who <b>that</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first stop}} after Olympia for [...] "The Old Oregon Trail Monument Expedition" [...] was Tenino, Washington, where Meeker went ahead by train on February 20, 1906 to make {{arrangements}} for the first monument of the trip. [...] He still had no driver, and had his wagon pulled to Tenino by horses, with the oxen trailing behind. [...] He appealed to a local quarry for a suitable stone, which was carved and was dedicated in Tenino at a ceremony on the 21st. He had less success as he journeyed south towards Portland; at none of the remaining Washington stops was a monument erected, and although Meeker placed wooden posts where monuments should go, most of the designated towns did not follow through. [...] The lack of enthusiasm about Meeker's mission continued in Portland, where the Unitarian church elders voted against allowing Meeker {{the use of the}} building to give a fundraising lecture, pledging to do nothing to [...] "encourage <b>that</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{to go out on the}} Plains to die".|$|E

2500|$|The Mexican Government {{protested the}} killings to President Chester Arthur {{despite the fact}} that the Mexican policemen had crossed into a foreign country where they had no jurisdiction.

In desperation, Sam kicks the controls, causing the air-car to accelerate so sharply <b>that</b> the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> is slammed back against the seat forcefully enough to crush the slug.

40|$|It’s {{the most}} common cancer among men. Prostate cancer will affect one in five men {{at some point in}} their lifetime, usually men over the age of forty. Fortu-nately, most {{prostate}} cancers are rela-tively slow growing. On the other hand, a new study published in the Journal of Urology (Vol. 185, pp. 132 - 7, 2010) showed <b>that</b> <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with prostate can-cer may have a more aggressive course. When researchers looked at the records of over 12, 000 men, they found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>older</b> than age 70 with prostate cancer were more likely to have an ag-gressive course of disease than younger men. Not only that, but prostate cancer mortality was higher in these men. Experts previously believed that most prostate cancers were slow growing even in <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> so most doctors advocated a less aggressive treatment approach for <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with prostate cancer due to their shorter overall life expectancy. This means <b>that</b> many <b>older</b> <b>men</b> haven’t been offered radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) due to the belief that they’ll die of other causes before their prostate cancer takes their life. This new study calls this approach into question. With men living longer, healthier lives, <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with prostate cancer should be offered RP and RT to (Continued on page 8...|$|R
