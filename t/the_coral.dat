5|$|During 1997–1999, Conservation International {{conducted}} a survey of <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> reef in the area. According to the survey, <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> diversity is relatively low, but fish species variation is rich. Some species found during the survey include Pogonoperca ocellata, Chaetodon gardneri, Chaetodon xanthocephalus, Centropyge flavipectoralis, Genicanthus caudovittatus, Halichoeres cosmetus, Stethojulis albovittatus, Scarus enneacanthus, Scarus scaber and Zebrasoma desjardinii.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{feeds on}} plankton. The tentacles of the dactylzooids are {{normally}} extended all the time. If an object is waved about above <b>the</b> <b>coral,</b> {{it will cause}} the tentacles to retract and then <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> can be handled without experiencing the painful stings caused by the cnidocytes.|$|E

5|$|While {{stalling}} {{over the}} western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm's immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within <b>the</b> <b>coral.</b> However, the hurricane's upwelling cooled {{the warm water}} temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> reef.|$|E
5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and <b>The</b> <b>Coral</b> Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. <b>The</b> <b>Coral</b> Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|August 19, 1976- Tropical Storm Dottie {{hits the}} southwestern {{portion of the}} state, {{dropping}} heavy precipitation across its path including around 8inches (200mm) in <b>the</b> <b>Coral</b> Gables. The rainfall led to flooding and road closures near Miami.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{measurements}} of cosmogenic Be- 10, Al- 26 and Cl- 36, and the indigenous (intrinsic) concentrations of the stable elements Be, Al and Cl in 120 - 200 kyr old corals from Barbados and Puerto Rico. The concentration levels of these radionuclides in <b>the</b> <b>corals</b> lie in <b>the</b> range 10 (4) to 10 (8) atoms/g. A comparison of the measured nuclide concentrations with those expected to be produced in <b>the</b> <b>corals</b> by nuclear interactions of energetic cosmic radiation shows that (i) the radionuclides Al- 26 and Cl- 36 are derived from in situ cosmic ray interactions in <b>the</b> <b>corals</b> after their formation, but that (ii) the radionuclide Be- 10 owes its provenance in the coralline lattice primarily due to incorporation of dissolved beryllium in seawater in the lattice structure of <b>the</b> <b>corals.</b> Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|In the Caribbean and {{tropical}} Pacific, direct contact between ~40–70% of common seaweeds and coral causes bleaching and death to <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> via transfer of lipid-soluble metabolites.

50|$|Many {{shallow water}} corals rely on {{photosynthetic}} symbiont protists, {{commonly known as}} zooxanthellae, {{to provide them with}} a large proportion of their nutrient requirements. If sea water temperatures rise, conditions may becomes stressful for <b>the</b> <b>corals,</b> and they may expel their zooxanthallae. This process is known as coral bleaching as, without their symbionts, <b>the</b> <b>corals</b> are white.|$|R

5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged <b>the</b> <b>coral</b> reef system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.|$|E
5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that developed}} within the season occurred within <b>the</b> <b>Coral</b> Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} tropical cyclones {{that occurred during the}} year, with only 5 tropical cyclones occurring within the basin. During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed to the south of New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Solitaire {{are saved}} when the limpet mine explodes seconds {{before they are}} dragged over the reef: though {{temporarily}} stunned by the explosion and injured on <b>the</b> <b>coral,</b> they are protected from the explosion by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda. Quarrel then rescues the couple.|$|E
50|$|Galaxea fascicularis {{gets its}} food from two sources. The polyps contain {{symbiotic}} photosynthetic microalgae called zooxanthellae which, under good conditions, can obtain almost sufficient energy from sunlight for <b>the</b> <b>coral's</b> needs. It is also heterotrophic; the polyps extend their tentacles and catch and ingest organic particles, sediment, zooplankton, bacteria and even dissolved organic matter. This supplies {{the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>coral's</b> needs.|$|R
50|$|The sediments {{that are}} present within the {{environment}} cause increased turbidity and may smother some organisms. <b>The</b> <b>corals</b> present on <b>the</b> fringing reefs use four processes {{to get rid}} of sediments which include polyp distension, tentacular movement, ciliary action and mucus production. <b>The</b> <b>corals</b> that are present then are thus likely those that can get rid of the sediments the best.|$|R

5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides.

5|$|Following {{these beliefs}} and traditions, Kanak people and Conservation International (CI) have been jointly {{involved}} in conserving the ancestral waters and natural resources. According to a rapid assessment survey conducted {{with help from}} the Kanaks, 42 coral reefs have been identified for protection near Nord's Mont Pani Province. Its rich biodiversity reserves also include sea cucumbers, molluscs, crustaceans, herrings, groupers, and snappers. Supporting Kanak traditions, <b>the</b> <b>Coral</b> Reef Initiative for the South Pacific's (CRISP) partnership with CI provided recommendations and underwater species guides to the Kanak people. In 2004, a proposal was put forward to promote the entire coastal region as a World Heritage Site. Further work on this initiative has been pursued by CI's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science, <b>the</b> <b>Coral</b> Reef Initiative for the South Pacific (CRISP), and the French Government, in collaboration with WWF to assess marine resources used by both Kanak tribes and people of European descent across three coastlines of the Nord Province.|$|E
