5|$|However, a newer study {{compared}} incidence {{rates of}} skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus {{and showed that}} these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as Centrosaurus was {{more closely related to}} Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>for</b> this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.|$|E
