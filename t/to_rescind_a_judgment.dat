Furthermore, a minority of common law jurisdictions, like South Africa, use the term [...] "rescission" [...] for what other jurisdictions call [...] "reversing", [...] "overturning" [...] or [...] "overruling" [...] a court judgment. In this sense, the term means to be set aside or make void, on application to the court that granted the judgment or to a higher court.

40|$|The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) {{provides}} borrowers with protections and remedies against certain {{actions by}} lenders.

50|$|The legislatures of {{some states}} have adopted rescissions of their prior applications. It is not clear from the {{language}} of Article V whether <b>a</b> subsequent vote <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> <b>an</b> application is permissible. As discussed above, however, if the purpose of Article V is to give state legislatures power over a recalcitrant Congress—and if state lawmakers may indeed limit their applications by specific subject matter—it is possible that federal courts would hold that rescissions of previous applications are likewise valid, {{in order to give}} more meaningful effect to the power which Article V confers upon state legislators.|$|R
