5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the body. Women are also {{portrayed in the}} pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, {{in contrast to the}} toga, and for educated people, since it was associated with philosophers. By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as a garment that embodied social unity.|$|E
5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> her legs and feet.|$|E

5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza, which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to call off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza. The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Late on December 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that was located within the South Pacific convergence zone to the northwest of Apia, Samoa. Located beneath an anticyclone, the system maintained deep convection near its elongated but well-defined circulation center. Early the next day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, (RSMC Nadi), started to monitor the area of disturbed weather as Tropical Depression 04F. Over the next two days, the depression moved towards the west, conditions surrounding the depression barely changed {{and as a result}} the depression steadily intensified. Early on December 5, the system had convective bands spiraling into and wrapping <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the low level circulation center. As a result of this, the JTWC started advisories on Tropical Cyclone 05P, with winds equivalent to a tropical storm. At 0200UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it as Daman. During that day Daman passed over Rotuma island while gradually intensifying further.|$|E
5|$|Tracking eastward, Jasmine {{entered a}} flow of dry air, which {{prevented}} the storm from strengthening quickly at the time. On 5 February, the low–level atmospheric circulation center of Jasmine became exposed due {{to the presence of}} strong vertical wind shear. However, the cyclone was able to maintain its intensity due to the existence of an area of moisture over Australia. Throughout the rest of the day, the wind shear subdued, and the system began to organize as convective banding wrapped around the center. As a result, Cyclone Jasmine intensified into the equivalent of a Category2 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, with winds of 95km/h (60mph), sustained for 10minutes. The next day, Cyclone Jasmine began to track to the east-southeast in response to a strengthening subtropical ridge. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify as convection continued to wrap <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the center of Jasmine. At the same time, the storm moved out of the BOM's area of responsibility and into the area of responsibility of the Fiji Meteorological Service's (FMS) tropical cyclone warning center at Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi).|$|E

5|$|The nascent system tracked {{generally}} west-northwestward {{around a}} subtropical ridge to its north. Favorable outflow {{to the south}} counteracted moderate wind shear, though a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast disrupted the thunderstorm structure. Late on August14, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Goni. The storm slowly intensified and organized as it approached the Marianas Islands on August15. With diminished wind shear, rainbands were able to wrap <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the center. When Goni passed just north of Rota on August15, radar on Guam indicated a developing eyewall in the storm's core. At 18:00UTC on August15, the JMA upgraded Goni to a severe tropical storm, and further to typhoon status by the next day. The previously disruptive trough to the north soon aided the storm's intensification by enhancing its outflow, and other environmental conditions remained favorable. Consequently, Goni began a period of rapid deepening on August16. By early on August17, Goni reached an initial peak intensity; the JMA estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph), and the JTWC assessed higher 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), derived from satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique. At the time, the typhoon had a small eye just 9km (6mi) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|During April 1, RSMC Nadi {{reported}} that Tropical Disturbance 14F, had developed along an active monsoon trough {{to the north}} of Fiji. During the next day the disturbance gradually developed into a tropical depression, as it moved eastwards and interacted with a shallow tropical disturbance that was located to the east of 14F. The disturbance was subsequently absorbed by 14F’s circulation early on April 3, while the system was located between Tonga and Fiji. Overall organization at this time was still poor with convection struggling to consolidate under shear and diurnal influences. Overnight of the 3rd, though, convection erupted over the centre with the primary band to the east wrapping <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the centre. On re-analysis, TD14F attained cyclone status around 031800 UTC while located to the north-northwest of Nukualofa and gradually accelerating towards the southeast. Through April 4, the cyclone moved into minimal shear with good outflow channels aloft. 12 hours later, at 040600 UTC, Lin was upgraded to a storm with 50 knots close to the centre. The cyclone intensified further under favourable conditions and reached a peak intensity of 60 knots while located about 15 nautical miles south-southeast of Nukualofa. As it left Tonga, interaction with drier air and shear increased. This was aided by an approaching upper-trough from the west. At 051800 UTC, intensity was reduced to 45 knots with further weakening anticipated due to stronger shear and cooler waters. Wellington took over warnings for the cyclone from 060000 UTC and downgraded Lin to an extra-tropical system in their first warning. TCWC Wellington subsequently continued to monitor the system until it was last noted on April 8.|$|E

25|$|Barruel’s Memoirs is {{considered}} one of the founding documents of the right-wing interpretation of the French Revolution. It became popular immediately after it was published and was read and commented on by most of the important literary and political journals of the day. The four volumes of the text were published in a number of languages and created a debate about the role of the philosophes, their ideas, and the Enlightenment in the French Revolution. They remained in print well into the 20th century and contributed to the historical interpretation of the late 18th century in France. The success of Barruels work is testimony to the anti-philosophical discourse that spread in the aftermath of the revolution. Barruel left behind a construction of the Enlightenment that was destined to influence subsequent interpretations. He wound accusations <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> his foes and tied them into positions from which they could not escape. The text created a link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and this connection remains a topic of historical debate.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He {{was the first to}} coil insulated wire <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> an iron core {{in order to make a}} more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E

500|$|... 10F {{was first}} {{identified}} as a tropical disturbance embedded in an active monsoon trough at 23/0000 UTC, approximately 380 {{miles to the west}} of Funafuti and moving eastwards about 05 to 10 knots. The system was then located just south of a 250-hPa ridge axis, in a diffluent region. Shear and diurnal variations were evidently influencing development. SST was around 31°C. Later on the 24th, shear had decreased markedly. Outflow was favourable and developing in all quadrants. Overnight, the depression underwent explosive development with the deep convection increasing spatially and in organization whilst cooling. Spiral bands were also wrapping <b>tightly</b> <b>around</b> the llcc. By 24/1800 UTC, TD10F was named Tropical Cyclone Percy, while located roughly 100 miles to the east of Funafuti and moving east-southeast at 14 knots under a deep west-northwest steering flow.|$|E
