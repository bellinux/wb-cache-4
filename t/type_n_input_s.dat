40|$|Recent {{advances}} in soil C saturation concepts have increased {{our understanding of}} soil C storage and mineralization without explicit links to N retention and saturation theories. Here, we exploit soil texture and organic matter (OM) gradients in a Maryland, USA hardwood forest to test hypotheses that link soil organic C saturation with soil 15 N retention and nitrification. At our site, mineral-associated OM (MAOM) N concentrations in the silt + clay particle fraction (g MAOM-N g silt + clay− 1) were negatively correlated with the fraction of NH 4 -N transferred to MAOM during a 3 -day in situ incubation (R = − 0. 85), but positively correlated with potential net nitrification (R = 0. 76). Moreover, the fraction of NH 4 -N transferred to MAOM was negatively correlated with potential net nitrification (R = − 0. 76). Due to physico-chemical stabilization mechanisms, MAOM {{is considered to be}} resistant to mineralization. Carbon saturation theory suggests that the proportion of new C inputs that can be stabilized in MAOM decreases in proportion to the amount of C already present in the fraction; C inputs not stabilized in MAOM are susceptible to rapid mineralization. We demonstrate that NH 4 -N stabilization in MAOM is similar to C stabilization in MAOM and associated with nitrification, thereby extending soil C saturation theory to mineral N and linking it with N retention and saturation theories. These data and concepts complement N saturation models that emphasize vegetation <b>type,</b> <b>N</b> <b>input</b> levels, and microbial turnover. Incorporating the OM retention capacity of fine mineral particles into N saturation theory can improve predictions of N saturation rates and resolve inconsistent relationships between soil organic matter, texture, N mineralization, and N retention...|$|R

40|$|Water and {{nitrogen}} (N) are two key limiting factors in orange (Citrus sinensis) production. The amount {{and the timing}} of water and N application are critical, but optimal strategies {{have not yet been}} well established. This study presents an analysis of 47 fertigation strategies examined by a coupled soil-crop model. The strategies include 27 main scenarios with a factorial design of 3 irrigation levels (420, 520 and 640 mm, representing 80 %, 100 % and 120 % of water demand), 3 <b>N</b> <b>input</b> levels (100, 200 and 300 kg ha - 1) and 3 main N split applications, and 20 additional scenarios testing alternative N split applications, extreme rainfall years (dry and wet) and different soil textures. The simulations showed that orange yields were strongly influenced by <b>N</b> <b>input</b> and <b>N</b> split applications, but not so much by irrigation. Increasing water and <b>N</b> <b>input</b> led to increased N losses (via leaching and denitrification), and there were significant positive interactions between water and <b>N</b> <b>input</b> with respect to N losses. On average, low <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (100 kg ha - 1) led to relatively low N losses (16 kg ha - 1) but resulted in low yield (33 t ha - 1, 25 % yield reduction). High <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (300 kg ha - 1) produced a high yield (43 t ha - 1) but led to large N losses (104 kg ha - 1). Optimal <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (200 kg ha - 1) significantly reduced N losses (45 kg ha - 1) without yield reduction. Importantly, with optimal <b>N</b> <b>input,</b> improving <b>N</b> split applications significantly increased yield by 13 % and reduced N losses by 40 %, compared to sub-optimal N splits. Significant interactions between water <b>inputs,</b> <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> and <b>N</b> split applications in yield and N losses indicate that the optimization of fertigation strategies must consider these three key variables simultaneously. Our results clearly show that over-optimal water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> lead to large water and N losses. Reduced irrigation (80 % of water demand) and <b>N</b> <b>input</b> equal to <b>N</b> demand (200 kg ha - 1) can significantly reduce N losses without yield reduction.

Reported effects {{of water and}} <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> on citrus yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency (NUE) vary greatly, mainly {{due to differences in}} cultivars, tree age, climate, soil types, and water and <b>N</b> <b>input</b> levels. So far, no systematic analysis has been performed, and as a result, the interactive effects of water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> on yield, WUE and NUE of citrus orchards are unknown. Also, gaps between attainable and actual yields, WUE and NUE have not been established yet. Here, we report on a global meta-analysis of yields, WUE and NUE of citrus production systems, using 1009 observations from 55 studies, conducted in 11 countries. Median citrus yields ranged from 30 to 60 t ha - 1, which were in between average global yields (range 10 - 30 t ha - 1) and attainable yields (range 60 - 90 t ha - 1). Median WUE ranged from 2. 5 to 5 kg m - 3 and median NUE from 150 to 350 kg kg - 1. Citrus yields were related to water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> and tree age. Relationships between water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> and yield, WUE and NUE were also analysed for sub-datasets and quantiles, to examine the relationships near the extremes. There were statistical significant interactions between water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> in yield and NUE, but not in WUE. This indicates that studies aiming at the optimization of water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> must consider interactions and optimize water and <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> simultaneously. Based on our analyses, we estimated that reducing over-optimal irrigation to optimal irrigation may increase citrus yield by 20 %, WUE by 30 % and NUE by 15 %. Similarly, reducing over-optimal N fertilization to optimal N fertilization may increase yield by 10 %, WUE by 15 % and NUE by 40 %.

We studied both early developmental (young) soils that had been receiving increased <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> over a decadal timescale since an eruption in 1963, and well-developed soils, that had been receiving <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> over a millennial timescale. For the latter, however, the effects on both decadal (topsoil; 40 years) and millennial (total soil profile; 1600 years) SOC storage could be studied, as the age of topsoil and the total soil profile could be determined from volcanic ash layers deposited in 1973 and 395 AD. We found that enhanced N availability—either from accumulation over time, or seabird derived—increased the net SOC storage rate. Under low <b>N</b> <b>inputs,</b> early developmental soils were weak decadal C sinks (0. 018 ton SOC ha− 1 year− 1), but this increased quickly under ca. 30 years of elevated <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> to 0. 29 ton SOC ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, thereby equalling the decadal SOC storage rate of the unfertilized well-developed soils.

These grasslands are mostly intensively managed with a total <b>N</b> <b>input</b> via fertilisation and atmospheric deposition in the range of 300 - 500 kg N ha- 1 year- 1. Net CH 4 emissions were measured with vented, closed flux chambers at four contrasting sites, which were chosen to represent a range of <b>N</b> <b>inputs.</b> There were no significant effects of grazing versus mowing, stocking density, and withholding N fertilisation for 3 - 9 years, on net CH 4 emissions. When the ground-water level was close to the soil surface, the injection of cattle slurry resulted in a significant net CH 4 production.

40|$|China is the world’s largest {{consumer}} of synthetic nitrogen (N), where very {{low rates of}} fertilizer N recovery in crops have been reported, raising discussion around whether fertilizer N use can be significantly reduced without yield penalties. However, using recovery rates as indicator ignores a possible residual effect of fertilizer N—a factor often unknown at large scales. Such residual effect might store N in the soil increasing N availability for subsequent crops. The objectives {{of the present study}} were therefore to quantify the residual effect of fertilizer N in China and to obtain more realistic rates of the accumulative fertilizer N recovery efficiency in crop production systems of China. Long-term spatially-extensive data on crop production, fertilizer N and other <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> to croplands in China were used to analyze the relationship between crop N uptake and fertilizer <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (or total <b>N</b> <b>input),</b> and to estimate the amount of residual fertilizer N. Measurement results of cropland soil N content in two time periods were obtained to compare the change in the soil N pool. At the provincial scale, it was found that there is a linear relationship between crop N uptake and fertilizer <b>N</b> <b>input</b> or total <b>N</b> <b>input.</b> With the increase in fertilizer <b>N</b> <b>input,</b> annual direct fertilizer N recovery efficiency decreased and was indeed low (below 30 % in recent years), while its residual effect increased continuously, to the point that 40 %– 68 % of applied fertilizer was used for crop production sooner or later.

In this study, we quantified <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs for 23 California watersheds and examined how climate, hydrology, and land use practices influenced watershed <b>N</b> export. <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> ranged from 581 to 11, 234 kg N km- 2 year- 1 among watersheds, with 80 % of total input for the region originating from agriculture (inorganic fertilizer, manure, and legumes). Of the potential N sources examined, mean annual concentrations of dissolved organic N and dissolved inorganic N in study rivers correlated most strongly with manure <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (r 2 = 0. 54 and 0. 53, respectively). Seasonal N export varied by basin and was correlated with climate, anthropogenic <b>N</b> <b>inputs,</b> and reservoir releases. Fractional export of watershed <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> by study rivers annually was small (median of 8 %) and scaled exponentially with runoff (r = 0. 66).

40|$|Human {{activities}} have significantly altered nitrogen (N) availability in most terrestrial ecosystems, with consequences for community composition and ecosystem functioning. Although studies of how changes in N availability affect biodiversity and community composition are relatively common, much less remains {{known about the}} effects of <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> on the coupled biogeochemical cycling of N and phosphorus (P), and still fewer data exist regarding how increased <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> affect the internal cycling of these two elements in plants. Nutrient resorption is an important driver of plant nutrient economies and of the quality of litter plants produce. Accordingly, resorption patterns have marked ecological implications for plant population and community fitness, as well as for ecosystem nutrient cycling. In a semiarid grassland in northern China, we studied the effects {{of a wide range of}} <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> on foliar nutrient resorption of two dominant grasses, Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. After 4 years of treatments, N and P availability in soil and N and P concentrations in green and senesced grass leaves increased with increasing rates of N addition. Foliar N and P resorption significantly decreased along the N addition gradient, implying a resorption-mediated, positive plant-soil feedback induced by <b>N</b> <b>inputs.</b> Furthermore, N:P resorption ratios were negatively correlated with the rates of N addition, indicating the sensitivity of plant N and P stoichiometry to <b>N</b> <b>inputs.</b> Taken together, the results demonstrate that N additions accelerate ecosystem uptake and turnover of both N and P in the temperate steppe and that N and P cycles are coupled in dynamic ways. The convergence of N and P resorption in response to <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> emphasizes the importance of nutrient resorption as a pathway by which plants and ecosystems adjust in the face of increasing N availability...|$|R

The resource efficiency and environmental emissions for clover/grass pastures can differ from that of N-fertilised grass-only pastures. Clover N 2 fixation uses photosynthetically-fixed carbon, whereas N fertiliser production consumes fossil fuels and has net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clover has a higher phosphorus (P) requirement than grass and where extra P fertiliser is used for clover/grass pastures the risk of P loss to waterways is greater than for grass-only pastures. Nitrogen leaching from grazed pasture increases exponentially with increased <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> and urine-N contributes 70 - 90 % of total N leaching. However, the few studies comparing clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> indicated similar <b>N</b> leaching losses. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from grazed pastures due to N-cycling of excreta are similar for clover/grass and N-fertilised grass-only pastures at similar total <b>N</b> <b>inputs.</b> However, the grass-N systems have additional specific losses from the fertiliser-N application. Thus, total N 2 O emissions are generally higher for N-fertilised grass pastures than for clover/grass pastures. A summary of various whole-system and Life Cycle Assessment analyses for dairy farms from various countries indicated that at similar total <b>N</b> <b>inputs,</b> clover/grass pasture systems can be more efficient than N-fertilised grass systems per kg of milk produced from an energy use and GHG perspective whereas results for nutrient losses to waterways were mixed and appear to be similar for both systems.

Whether the proportion of <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> captured in harvest grows, shrinks, or remains unchanged will have important impacts on both food production and N pollution. We created a new global <b>N</b> <b>input</b> database (fertilizer, manure, fixation, deposition, and residues) that enables evaluation of trends in nitrogen use and recovery by country and by crop from the 1960 s through 2007. These data show that despite growth in yields and increased N fertilization, differences in efficiency of N use between Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; [URL] and other countries have persisted over nearly 50 years and exhibit no sign of convergence. The high yield, high nitrogen input systems characteristic of rich countries have released large amounts of reactive N to the environment but have operated with greater efficiency—recovering a greater portion of added N in crops. Aggregate yields in OECD countries are 70 %greater than in non-OECD countries on <b>N</b> <b>input</b> rates just 54 % greater.

We present a new synthesis for terrestrial <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> that explicitly considers both rock and atmospheric sources of N. We review evidence for state-factor regulation over biological fixation, deposition, and rock-weathering inputs from local to global scales and in transient vs. steady-state landscapes. Our investigation highlights strong organism and topographic (relief) controls over all three <b>N</b> <b>input</b> pathways, with the anthropogenic factor clearly important in rising N deposition rates. In addition, the climate, parent material, and time factors are shown to influence patterns of fixation and rock-weathering <b>inputs</b> of <b>N</b> in diverse soil systems. Data reanalysis suggests that weathering of N-rich parent material could resolve several known cases of "missing N inputs" in ecosystems, and demonstrates how the inclusion of rock N sources into modern concepts {{can lead to a}} richer understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem N availability. For example, explicit consideration of rock <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> into classic pedogenic models (e. g., the Walker and Syers model) yields a fundamentally different expectation from the standard case: weathering of N-rich parent material could enhance N availability and facilitate terrestrial succession in developmentally young sites {{even in the absence of}} N-fixing organisms. We conclude that a state-factor framework for N complements our growing understanding multiple-source controls on phosphorus and cation availability in Earth's soil, but with significant exceptions given the lack of an N fixation analogue in all other biogeochemical cycles. Rather, non-symmetrical feedbacks among input pathways in which high <b>N</b> <b>inputs</b> via deposition or rock-weathering sources have the potential to reduce biological fixation rates mark N as fundamentally different from other nutrients.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activity}} is causing {{dramatic changes in}} the nitrogen (N) cycle in many ecosystems. Most research has focused on the increase in <b>N</b> <b>input</b> caused by atmospheric deposition and invasion of N-fixing species, and on their effects on resource availability and species composition. However, in contrast to many ecosystems experiencing large increases in <b>N</b> <b>input,</b> many arid ecosystems are experiencing loss of nutrients due to land-use change. An important component of many arid ecosystems on a worldwide basis is the microbiotic crust, a biological soil crust composed of lichens, cyanobacteria, mosses, and algae. Nitrogen fixation by lichens and cyanobacteria comprising the crust is the primary source of <b>N</b> <b>input</b> in many of these ecosystems. We quantified the long-term consequences of surface disturbance in an arid ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau by comparing pristine sites with those of known disturbance history. Disturbance caused an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria and a decrease in lichens within the microbiotic crust. Carbon isotope composition (delta(13) C) of the crust reflects this shift in species composition; values for disturbed sites were 4. 5 parts per thousand higher than undisturbed sites. Nitrogen isotope composition (delta(15) N) of the microbiotic crust was 1. 5 - 2. 2 parts per thousand higher for disturbed sites, probably resulting from relatively greater gaseous N loss from the crust. Historic disturbance has caused a long-term decrease in rates of N fixation by the microbiotic crust; nitrogenase activity in pristine sites was 250 % greater than sites intermittently disturbed 30 yr ago. The decrease in <b>N</b> <b>input</b> from fixation and continued gaseous N loss has caused a 25 - 75 % decrease in soil N content. Altering relative rates of <b>N</b> <b>input</b> and loss, coupled with <b>input</b> of <b>N</b> from microbiotic crusts with relatively higher delta(15) N, has caused an increase in soil and plant delta(15) N at disturbed sites.
