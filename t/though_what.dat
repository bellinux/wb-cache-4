5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, <b>though</b> <b>what</b> actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E
5|$|Voltaire {{develops}} no formal, systematic philosophy for {{the characters}} to adopt. The {{conclusion of the}} novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (<b>though</b> <b>what</b> it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and {{the conclusion of the}} work in which Martin plays little part.|$|E

25|$|Adultery (anglicised from Latin adulterium) is extramarital {{sex that}} is {{considered}} objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. <b>Though</b> <b>what</b> sexual activities constitute adultery varies, {{as well as the}} social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.|$|E

The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as China and India, the most prominent of which was Azure City, which greatly resembled feudal Japan (though a few Chinese elements were present). Four separate areas in the South besides Azure city are briefly shown.|$|E
25|$|Though gender {{discrimination}} and sexism refer to beliefs and attitudes {{in relation to}} the gender of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. <b>Though</b> <b>what</b> constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of prejudice and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.|$|E

25|$|Papiamento has a {{standardized}} orthography. There are two Languages of Papiamento, one spoken {{on the island}} of Aruba and the other on the islands of Curaçao and Bonaire. The orthographies of these dialects differ slightly. The orthography of the Aruban dialect is more etymological in nature, while the other is more phonemic. Among {{the differences between the two}} dialects, one obvious difference is the way the name of the language is written. In Aruba it is called Papiamento, while in Curaçao it is called Papiamentu. <b>Though</b> <b>what</b> is spoken on Bonaire isn't a separate dialect, there it is sometimes called Papiamen. The governments of Curaçao and Aruba formally accepted orthographic rules according to their dialects in 1976 and 1977, respectively.|$|E
25|$|One of Holmes' early {{murder victims}} was his mistress, Julia Smythe. She was {{the wife of}} Alex Conner, who had moved into Holmes' {{building}} and began working at his pharmacy's jewelry counter. After Conner found out about Smythe's affair with Holmes, he quit his job and moved away, leaving Smythe and her daughter Pearl behind. Smythe gained custody of Pearl and remained at the hotel, continuing her relationship with Holmes. Julia and Pearl disappeared on Christmas of 1891, and Holmes later claimed that she had died during an abortion, <b>though</b> <b>what</b> truly happened to the two was never confirmed. Another likely Holmes paramour, Emeline Cigrande, began working in the building in May 1892, and disappeared that December. Another woman who vanished, Edna Van Tassel, is also {{believed to have been}} one of Holmes' victims.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons {{commonly}} given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of S enjoyable, and the answer is largely dependent on the individual. For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure (see: Servitude (BDSM)). A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist. It is poorly understood, <b>though,</b> <b>what</b> ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification, or how that connection initially forms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, <b>though</b> <b>what</b> each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E

500|$|Country Grammar {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} by music critics. NME lauded the album, praising Nelly's utilization of vocal characteristics from other rap artists, including Tupac Shakur and Cypress Hill. The magazine described the album as a [...] "rarity", noting stand-out tracks {{such as the}} [...] "seductive rap/pop crossover" [...] "Ride wit Me", while likening [...] "Batter Up" [...] to [...] "DMX with a humour infusion". NME closed their review declaring Country Grammar as [...] "album of the year". Giving the album a B–, Entertainment Weekly David Browne wrote the album demonstrates that [...] "tiresome rap topics" [...] are not restricted to [...] "the coasts". <b>Though</b> <b>what</b> salvages the album is Nelly's [...] "smooth, slippery-fast" [...] voice, which contains [...] "reggae inflections". Browne describes the album's content as minimalistic, with [...] "introspective moments" [...] such as [...] "Ride wit Me".|$|E

500|$|Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host {{life cycle}} {{involving}} a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm {{known to be}} susceptible to M. cerebralis infection is Tubifex tubifex, <b>though</b> <b>what</b> scientists currently call T. tubifex {{may in fact be}} more than one species. [...] First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the gut lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to the gut epithelium by polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Atatürk's {{reforms are}} called Kemalists, as {{distinguished}} from Islamists, representing the two diverging views regarding {{the role of}} religion in legislation, education and public life. The Kemalist view supports a form of democracy with a laicist constitution and Westernised secular lifestyle, while maintaining the necessity of state intervention in the economy, education and other public services. Since the 1980s, issues such as income inequality and class distinction have given rise to Islamic populism, a movement that supports a larger role for religion in government policies, and in theory supports obligation to authority, communal solidarity and social justice; <b>though</b> <b>what</b> that entails in practice is often contested. Turkey under Tayyip Erdoğan and the AKP has been described as becoming increasingly authoritarian. Prior to the constitutional referendum in 2017 the Council of Europe saw Turkey drifting towards an autocracy, warning of a [...] "dramatic regression of its democratic order".|$|E
