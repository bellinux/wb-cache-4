5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} filled with traps, laser defence {{mechanisms}} and security robots, all of which kill <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> on contact, resulting {{in the loss of}} one of his five lives. These defences must be shut down with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress, as the player has no weapon to directly attack the robots with. The jet pack enables <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> to travel more quickly, but has a limited supply of nitro fuel. Should this fuel run out then <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> will lose a life. The spaceship contains points at which the jet pack can be refuelled, though these can be difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> corps and would likely be close to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar {{landings}} took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E

5|$|Colonel George David Zamka– NASA astronaut– USMC– USNA Class of 1984: Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1962, Zamka {{was raised}} in New York City; Irvington, New York; Medellín, Colombia; and Rochester Hills, Michigan. He flew 66 combat {{missions}} over occupied Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. In June 1998, Zamka was selected for <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> program, and reported for training in August. Zamka served as lead for the shuttle training and procedures division and as supervisor for <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> candidate class of 2004. Zamka completed his first spaceflight as the pilot of STS-120 (October, 13– November 7, 2007). STS-120 (Discovery) traveled to the International Space Station to deliver the U.S. Node 2 Module, while also reconfiguring part of the station to prepare it for future assembly missions.|$|E

50|$|For {{missions}} to <b>the</b> ISS, each <b>astronaut</b> {{is required to}} become proficient at one hundred or more experiments. During training, the scientists responsible for the experiments do not have direct contact with <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> who will be carrying them out. Instead, scientists instruct trainers who in turn prepare <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> for carrying out the experiment. Much of this training is done at <b>the</b> European <b>Astronaut</b> Centre.|$|R
5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active involvement of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> and two completely passive. The first involved <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, {{and for a}} xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by <b>the</b> <b>astronaut,</b> well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 NASA T-38 crash {{occurred}} when a NASA Northrop T-38 Talon crashed at Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri, on February 28, 1966, killing two Project Gemini astronauts, Elliot See and Charles Bassett. The aircraft, piloted by See, {{crashed into the}} McDonnell Aircraft building where their Gemini 9 spacecraft was being assembled. The weather was poor with rain, snow, fog, and low clouds. A NASA panel, headed by the Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Office, Alan Shepard, investigated the crash. While the panel considered possible medical issues or aircraft maintenance problems, {{in addition to the}} weather and air traffic control factors, the end verdict was that the crash was caused by pilot error.|$|E
50|$|Advanced suits better {{regulate}} <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> temperature with a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) {{in contact}} with <b>the</b> <b>astronaut's</b> skin, from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the PLSS.|$|R
50|$|Flight day 4 began for <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> at 15:47 UTC. During {{the first}} EVA of <b>the</b> mission, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> of STS-116 brought the ISS {{one step closer}} to {{completion}} with the addition of the P5 truss segment.|$|R
5000|$|Two common misconceptions {{surround}} Quindar tones. The {{first is}} that one tone came from Earth and the other from the transmitters used by <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> while in space. This confusion exists because many ground-to-space transmissions were initiated by Mission Control and responded to by <b>the</b> <b>astronauts.</b> In this sequence, the CapCom would press the PTT, which would send the intro tone, and then speak. When finished speaking, the CapCom would release the PTT, which would send the outro tone, and <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> would respond to Mission Control. Therefore, those transmissions would consist of a [...] "beep" [...] (PTT press) followed by Houston talking, then another [...] "beep" [...] (PTT release) and finally the voice of <b>the</b> <b>astronauts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{results of}} the mission were mixed. <b>The</b> <b>astronaut</b> returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted {{compared with that of}} earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.|$|E
5|$|After Shepard left NASA, {{he served}} {{on the boards of}} many corporations. He also served as {{president}} of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decade after}} photographing the post-war {{reconstruction}} of Europe, Morse received his next singular assignment: documenting American preparations to explore outer space.

5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted and remembered in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (very briefly) in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film That Thing You Do! Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series <b>The</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{designated}} as {{the commander of the}} first manned Project Gemini mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to Ménière's disease, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module Antares to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions. At age 47, he became the fifth and oldest person to walk on the Moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface. He was Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Astronaut</b> Office from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the United States Navy and NASA on August 1, 1974.

5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting <b>the</b> spacecraft, <b>the</b> <b>astronauts</b> would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on <b>the</b> Moon. <b>The</b> <b>astronauts</b> traveled from <b>the</b> Grand Canyon to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|R
5|$|The 2012 book Rising Above the Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{cited the}} fact that the Obama Administration hosted the first White House Astronomy Night, as a {{reflection}} of the President's support for education in the STEM fields.

Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> by Lynn Sherr, discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Lions {{explosion}} {{becomes one}} of the major accidents in spaceflight history and sets Japan's spaceflight program back by over a decade. In the years following the accident, the public accuses those involved with the Lion program of negligence. Rumors also begin to circulate about the offshore outsourcing of the rocket's production despite the government's claims that it was developed domestically. To promote recovery from the tragedy, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology establishes the Tokyo National Space School in 2014 as a vocational high school dedicated to training a new generation of students in the space sciences. Japan's spaceflight program is finally reactivated ten years later with the admission of students into the academy's astronaut training program. In the same year, the last operating module of the International Space Station is retired and destroyed by atmospheric reentry following completion of the station's long-term mission. Subsequent development projects are to be completed by individual countries with active spaceflight programs. Of the students in the inaugural class of <b>the</b> <b>astronaut</b> training program, one is selected to join the crew of Japan's second manned mission in 2027. It is the final mission toward completing a space-based solar power satellite.|$|E
