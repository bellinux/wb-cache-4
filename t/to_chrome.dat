5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, these devices will support the use of an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line <b>to</b> <b>Chrome</b> OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E

25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>chrome</b> on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the front quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|Chrome supported, up to version 45, {{plug-ins}} {{with the}} Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI), so that plug-ins (for example Adobe Flash Player) run as unrestricted separate processes outside the browser and cannot be sandboxed as tabs are. ActiveX is not supported. Since 2010, Adobe Flash has been integral <b>to</b> <b>Chrome</b> {{and does not}} need be installed separately. Flash is {{kept up to date}} as part of Chrome's own updates. Java applet support was available in Chrome with Java 6 update 12 and above. Support for Java under OS X was provided by a Java Update released on May 18, 2010.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, Google {{released}} {{a large portion}} of Chrome's source code as an open-source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the macOS and Linux operating systems. The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the permissive BSD license. Other portions of the source code are subject to a variety of open-source licenses. Chromium is similar <b>to</b> <b>Chrome,</b> but lacks built-in automatic updates and built-in Flash player, as well as Google branding and has a blue-colored logo instead of the multicolored Google logo. Chromium does not implement user RLZ tracking. Initially, the Google Chrome PDF viewer, PDFium, was excluded from Chromium, but was later made open-source in May 2014. PDFium can be used to fill PDF forms.|$|E

2500|$|In {{benchmark}} {{testing in}} early 2015 on a [...] "high-end" [...] Windows machine, comparing Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, Firefox {{achieved the highest score}} on {{three of the}} seven tests. Four different Javascript performance tests gave conflicting results. Firefox bested the others on the Peacekeeper benchmark, but was behind the Microsoft products when tested with SunSpider. Measured with Mozilla's Kraken, it came second place <b>to</b> <b>Chrome,</b> while on Google's Octane challenge it took third behind Chrome and Opera. Firefox took the lead with WebXPRT, which runs several typical HTML5 and Javascript tasks. Firefox, Chrome, and Opera all achieved the highest possible score on the Oort Online test, measuring WebGL rendering speed (WebGL 2 is now current). In terms of HTML5 compatibility testing, Firefox was ranked {{in the middle of the}} group.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, Google {{made the}} first update <b>to</b> <b>Chrome</b> OS's user {{interface}} since the operating system had launched, introducing a hardware-accelerated window manager called [...] "Aura" [...] along with a conventional taskbar. The additions marked {{a departure from the}} operating system's original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave Chrome OS {{the look and feel of}} a more conventional desktop operating system. [...] "In a way, this almost feels as if Google is admitting defeat here", wrote Frederic Lardinois on TechCrunch. He argued that Google had traded its original version of simplicity for greater functionality. [...] "That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, and may just help Chrome OS gain more mainstream acceptance as new users will surely find it to be a more familiar experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Windows 10 S is a feature-limited {{edition of}} Windows 10 {{designed}} primarily for low-end devices {{in the education}} market. It has a faster initial setup and login process, and allows devices to be provisioned using a USB drive with the [...] "Set Up School PCs" [...] app. Windows 10 S only allows the installation of software (both Universal Windows Platform and Windows API apps) from Windows Store, although command line programs or shells (even from Windows Store) are not allowed. System settings are locked to only allow Microsoft Edge as the default web browser with Bing as its search engine. The operating system may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee, to enable unrestricted software installation. Microsoft also provides means of downgrading back to the S edition. All Windows 10 S devices will include a free one-year subscription to [...] Critics have compared the edition to Windows RT, and have considered {{it to be a}} competitor <b>to</b> <b>Chrome</b> OS.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011 Google {{announced}} {{directions for}} the project for the year, including a plan for seven new major versions, planning to end the year with Chrome 17 out. Development priorities will focus on reducing the browser's size, integrating web applications and plug-ins, cloud capabilities and touch interface. The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared <b>to</b> <b>Chrome</b> 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a [...] "bloat taskforce". Larger download sizes are a problem {{for a number of}} reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: [...] "1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures / install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens {{to be a very good}} market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Navarro first {{appeared}} {{with the band}} at Woodstock '94. The band opened their set wearing enormous light bulb costumes attached precariously <b>to</b> <b>chrome</b> metallic suits, making it near-impossible for them to play their instruments. Navarro hated the idea but went with it. The performance saw the debut of new songs such as [...] "Warped", [...] "Aeroplane", and [...] "Pea" [...] although the songs were in the beginning stages and the lyrics were {{very different from the}} final versions. The band followed up their performance at Woodstock with a brief tour, which included headlining appearances at the Pukkelpop and Reading Festivals as well two performances as the opening act for The Rolling Stones. According to Kiedis, however, opening for the Stones was a horrible experience. While externally, the band appeared to be settled, the relationship between the three established members and Navarro had begun to deteriorate. His differing musical background made performing difficult as they began playing together, and continued to be an issue over the next year. Navarro admitted he did not care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis was also struggling with his heroin addiction; he had been through a dental procedure in Beverly Hills, in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs, although the band would not find this out until later.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the social}} {{problems}} {{of the nineteenth century}} the tramp has always held an important position, but his appearance among the nineteenth-century poets is extremely remarkable. Not that a tramp's mode of life is at all unsuited {{to the development of the}} poetic faculty. Far from it! He, if any one, should possess that freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist, for he has no taxes to pay and no relations to worry him. The man who possesses a permanent address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is necessarily limited and localised. Only the tramp has absolute liberty of living. Was not Homer himself a vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a caravan? It is then with feelings of intense expectation that we open the little volume that lies before us. It is entitled Low Down, by Two Tramps, and is marvellous even to look at. It is clear that art has at last reached the criminal classes. The cover is of brown paper like the covers of Mr. Whistler's brochures. The printing exhibits every fantastic variation of type, and the pages range in colour from blue to brown, from grey to sage green and from rose pink <b>to</b> <b>chrome</b> yellow. The Philistines may sneer at this chromatic chaos, but we do not. As the painters are always pilfering from the poets, why should not the poet annex the domain of the painter and use colour for the expression of his moods and music: blue for sentiment, and red for passion, grey for cultured melancholy, and green for descriptions? The book, then, is a kind of miniature rainbow, and with all its varied sheets is as lovely as an advertisement hoarding. As for the peripatetics--alas! they are not nightingales. Their note is harsh and rugged, Mr. G. R. Sims is the god of their idolatry, their style is the style of the Surrey Theatre, and we are sorry to see that that disregard of the rights of property which always characterises the able-bodied vagrant is extended by our tramps from the defensible pilfering from hen-roosts to the indefensible pilfering from poets. When we read such lines as: ...|$|E
