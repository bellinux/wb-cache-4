500|$|Although {{the game}} had [...] "incredible {{role-playing}} potential", {{the concept of}} role-playing rabbits {{can be viewed as}} bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that [...] "most people thought it was stupid" [...] when it was first released. This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says [...] "Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's <b>the</b> <b>point?</b> <b>You</b> can't do anything!'".|$|E
500|$|Mars {{said of the}} song, [...] "It took me {{months to}} come up with 'Just the Way You Are'... I wasn't {{thinking}} of anything deep or poetic. I was telling a story. Get ready to fall in love!" [...] He added, [...] "I'm a big fan of songs like Joe Cocker's 'You Are So Beautiful' and Eric Clapton's 'Wonderful Tonight' - songs that go straight to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>You</b> know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs. There's nothing mind-blowing about it. I'm just telling a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS - and, let's be honest, what woman doesn't wanna hear those lyrics?!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Wire {{published}} a favorable review by Joseph Stannard, {{in which he}} wrote [...] "If it is an elaborate put-on—and I suspect Ferraro isn't averse to a chuckle {{at the expense of}} his audience—Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases' worth of research and development. ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze, Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime." [...] Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies, citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent. Wharton said, [...] "Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages." [...] In Pitchforks review, Soderberg wrote, [...] "the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> ... <b>You</b> suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always." ...|$|E
5000|$|These k <b>points</b> are <b>the</b> [...] "pieces" [...] of the vote: If {{you know}} all of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>you</b> can figure out the {{polynomial}} pn (and hence {{you can figure out}} how the voter voted). However, if you know only some of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> <b>you</b> can't figure out the polynomial. (This is because <b>you</b> need k <b>points</b> to determine a degree-k-1 polynomial. Two points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Subdivide now {{each line}} segment of this polygon with the ratio [...] and connect <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> get. This way {{you arrive at}} the new polygon having one fewer segment.|$|R
6000|$|Devine {{laughed a}} little. [...] "There {{was once a}} jumper who figured he'd found <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> {{mentioned}} out. He wanted eight thousand dollars. Would you be content with that?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Technique is {{something}} you use to make your ideas listenable", he once told jazz writer Len Lyons. [...] "You learn to play the instrument {{so you have a}} musical vocabulary, and you practice to get your technique to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> need to express yourself, depending on how heavy your ideas are".|$|E
60|$|HILLCRIST. That's beside <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>You</b> promised me, and I sold on that understanding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I {{appreciate}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> raise. Nevertheless, Mrs. Travers appears very insistent. I {{think it}} would be well to acquiesce in her wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I notice both <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> mention. Well, I am much {{obliged to}} you for the news. It is very important. I was {{thinking}} of cutting her out, tonight; and should have fallen into the same error you so nearly did, in the privateer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> Celia, and <b>you</b> know it. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> {{is whether}} <b>you</b> believe {{the chances are}} for or against her in such a marriage. Do you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 3 = Mildly upset. Worried, {{bothered to}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that <b>you</b> notice it.|$|R

60|$|Do {{you get the}} idea? The whole harm in the anecdotes is in <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> see; {{and when}} we swap them around that way, they haven't any.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Humph!' {{said the}} blind man, after some consideration. 'Set {{me with my}} face towards <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> speak of, {{and in the middle}} of the road. Is this the spot?' ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> more <b>points</b> <b>you</b> earn <b>the</b> {{higher in}} the system you go, the ranks are as follows in {{ascending}} order: ...|$|R
5000|$|Patrocinador (Partner): this rank is {{exclusively}} {{for people who}} have a paid advertisement in Taringa. At present, each time a user rates a post, the author increases their overall score (“karma”) and with the time they are able to increase their rank. That is to say that <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> can give are not accumulated over time but are refreshed daily.|$|R
5000|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to get exactly, or as close to, 100 <b>points</b> by <b>the</b> end of 12 {{question}}s. The answer to each question is a number, which is <b>the</b> amount of <b>points</b> <b>you</b> have [...] "to play with". With <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> can keep them, give them to someone or, if possible, take them away from someone else. If you have 100 {{at the end of the}} game you get the ultimate [...] "prize pod". This is a whole room full of games, computers, televisions, and similar prizes but if no-one gets 100, then the closest to 100, at the end of the game, gets to pick one of the prizes in the prize pod.|$|R
6000|$|... "I follow you, yes. I see <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> {{are trying}} to make, certainly. Market ... Snodsbury ... Grammar School ... Board of {{governors}} ... Prize-giving.... Quite. But what's it {{got to do with}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> {{are trying}} to make, Rover. You {{are trying to}} prove that you were placed under arrest, so to speak, before you were under our {{authority}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did n't I kill myself? That {{question}} would be more to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>You</b> are looking wonderfully well," [...] she broke off in another tone; [...] "had n't we better sit down?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 6 = Feeling bad to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that <b>you</b> {{begin to}} think {{something}} {{ought to be done}} about the way you feel.|$|R
25|$|The Amateurs, {{once they}} get to the mains usually only race once for <b>the</b> top <b>points</b> and <b>the</b> trophy. The Professionals on the other hand run {{multiple}} cumulative Mains just like in the qualifying motos for <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> trophy and most important, prize money. This is both NBL and ABA practice. Like during the qualifying motos <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>you</b> earn in each running of the Pro Main are tied into the position you finish {{in each of the three}} motos.|$|R
5000|$|... "I...you know I can't really {{remember}} right now, I can't really recall that, but that's beside <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> | <b>You</b> wanna do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, sir, I am {{a coming}} to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>You</b> will inquire of me, [...] "how is {{this to be}} prevented?" [...] I'll tell you how. If an honest, civil, smiling gentleman like you--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{said once}} before," [...] said Whittington angrily, [...] "quit fooling, {{and come to}} <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>You</b> can't play the {{innocent}} with me. You {{know a great deal}} more than you're willing to admit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shall I not?' said Fakredeen, triumphantly. 'What are my {{debts to}} my resources? That is <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>You</b> cannot judge {{of a man}} by only knowing what his debts are; you must be acquainted with his resources.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where <b>you</b> {{might have}} the {{impression}} that you respected butlers, when you merely loved your fellow-men. You see the difference?" ...|$|R
50|$|Castle <b>Points</b> = are <b>the</b> <b>points</b> that <b>you</b> obtain by {{constructing}} Royal Buildings. Increasing its number {{helps you}} open new land for your kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 = Somewhat upset to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that <b>you</b> cannot easily ignore an {{unpleasant}} thought. You {{can handle it}} OK but don't feel good.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far," [...] he contended, [...] "we haven't scored much; {{it looks}} as if the {{opposition}} were pretty smart. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> have to answer is this--suppose they do some serious damage before we can stop them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LOUIS. [...] Who calls me? she That was my wife, now yours? You {{have her}} Duchy, <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> aim'd at, and pray God she prove True wife to you. You {{have had the}} better of us In secular matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder that}} they ran," [...] said Alan, laughing, for {{the vision of}} a missionary with Little Bonsa on his head caught his fancy. [...] "But come to <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> old heathen. What do you mean that I should do?" ...|$|E
