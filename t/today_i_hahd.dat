5000|$|Disempowering usual {{perceptions}} of culture, Lhakar started to use art, literature, poetry and {{music as a}} tool to gain greater political rights. They are using aspects of traditional Tibetan culture, such as expressing their faith in the Dalai Lama, and love of their homeland. Songs with politically charged lyrics or music videos with images of the Dalai Lama became more widely circulated and known. This upsurge in the public consumption of Tibetan music and poetry has spawned a modern renaissance in art and literature across the plateau. I has been asserted that through these activities, Tibetans are rediscovering [...] "how culture can save politics, instead of politics to save culture". The Lhakar movement is encouraging the revival of public enthusiasm for studying Tibetan.In various parts of Tibet, elders and children take pledges to speak pure Tibetan, shedding Chinese terms from their vocabulary. Their pledge is as follows:I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will speak pure Tibetan in my family.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will speak pure Tibetan whenever I meet a Tibetan.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will remind myself every day that I am a Tibetan till I die.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will wear only Tibetan traditional dress, chuba, every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will speak only Tibetan every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will learn Tibetan language.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will stop eating meat and only eat a vegetarian diet and gain more merit every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> <b>I</b> will only use Tibetan and speak Tibetan when I call or send a message to Tibetans.|$|R
