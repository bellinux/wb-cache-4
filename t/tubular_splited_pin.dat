50|$|A brass {{fastener}}, brad, paper fastener or <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is a stationery item {{used for}} securing multiple {{sheets of paper}} together.A patent of the fastener was issued in 1866 to George W McGill.The fastener is inserted into punched holes in the stack of paper, and the leaves, or tines, of the legs are separated and bent over to secure the paper. This holds the pin in place and the sheets of paper together. For few sheets of paper, holes can be made using the sharp end of the fastener. A <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> {{may be used in}} place of staples, but they are more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. This lends <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> to use in mobile paper and cardboard models.It is shaped somewhat like a nail with a round head and flat, split length. Brass fasteners are made of a soft metal such as brass and the tines are typically of two slightly different lengths. This allows easy separation of the tines.A brass fastener is similar in design and function to the mechanical counterpart <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

40|$|Bamboo {{is viewed}} as a {{sustainable}} and highly renewable material that may be grown in any temperate climate zone. Interest in the engineering properties of bamboo and the use of bamboo in engineered construction is growing. Although often having superior mechanical properties than readily available sawn timber, bamboo, being largely an unidirectional fibrous material, is very susceptible to longitudinal splitting. Despite being the dominant limit state in many applications, very little previous work has addressed the characterization of bamboo splitting failure. The present research focuses on the development of a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test method for characterizing the splitting strength of bamboo culms. The proposed <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test uses a full culm section test, thereby eliminating some of the complexities of partial culm tests. Results of a pilot study of the <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test having similar specimens with different <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> diameters yielded consistent results and variations less than that of the previously standardized direct shear test. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed test method, a series of tests was performed on samples of Tre Gai (Bambusa stenostachya Hackel) bamboo. © 2010 ASCE...|$|R

50|$|As shown above, {{there are}} {{different}} types of ends available on <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> The most common is the extended prong with a square cut, but extended prongs are available {{with all of the}} other types of ends. The extended prong type is popular because it makes it easier to separate the tines. To ease insertion into a hole the longer tine may be slightly curved to overlap the tip of the shorter tine or it is beveled. The length, L, of the <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is defined as the distance {{from the end of the}} shortest tine to the point of the eyelet that contacts the hole.|$|R

50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} made of soft metal, making them easy {{to install and}} remove, but also making it inadvisable {{to use them to}} resist strong shear forces. Common materials include mild steel, brass, bronze, stainless steel, and aluminium.|$|R
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> This means that <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> prior to the accident. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Split</b> <b>pins</b> are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. clevis pins, {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to secure a castellated nut.|$|R

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of clevis pins: {{threaded}} and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head {{at one end and}} a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (USA usage) or <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is used to keep the clevis pin in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.|$|R
5000|$|A clevis {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} a clevis, clevis pin, and tang. The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end of}} the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The clevis pin is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a <b>split</b> <b>pin.</b> The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. [...] The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|R

50|$|Most recently, 817 Squadron has {{provided}} aircraft for Operation Sumatra Assist and Operation Sumatra Assist II, which were Australia's {{contribution to the}} humanitarian effort in Indonesia {{as a result of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake. During the latter operation, one of the two Seakings (Shark 02) embarked on HMAS Kanimbla, crashed on the Island of Nias with the loss of nine personnel. The accident occurred as a result of a series of maintenance errors, specifically the incorrect re-fitting of a nut and <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> during maintenance performed on the aircraft some two months before the crash. Deficiencies in maintenance practices, training, support and logistics operations within the Navy were also identified as contributing factors. Following the accident, several major changes were made to maintenance and safety management practices at 817 Squadron.|$|R
