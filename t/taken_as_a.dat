5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|During 1836–37, Otto visited Germany, {{marrying a}} {{beautiful}} and talented 17-year-old, Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece, but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage did not produce an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had a liaison with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lover.|$|E

5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} {{to the world}} that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs. In one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prize of war by the United States in 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink in a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy.

5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.

5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
