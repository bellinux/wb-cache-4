Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>Beyond</b> the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

25|$|Following a lacklustre 2000 {{season and}} {{the demise of the}} Vitalicio Seguros squad, González de Galdeano moved to one of the top Spanish teams in , run by Manolo Saiz. ONCE {{targeted}} the Tour de France as well as the Vuelta a España, so González de Galdeano was able to start his first Tour in 2001. ONCE had a fresh look in this 88th edition of the Tour: Laurent Jalabert and Abraham Olano were gone and the new team leader was Joseba Beloki, who had finished third the previous year for Festina. It was in this Tour that González de Galdeano first demonstrated his excellent time-trialling skills to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> Spain, placing second in both the short prologue around Dunkirk and also the 61km test from Montlucon to Saint Amand Montrond. González de Galdeano ultimately finished fifth in the Tour and helped Beloki to a second consecutive third place. González de Galdeano also had another good Vuelta, placing fourth in the first stage time-trial and winning a road stage into Zaragoza, breaking clear in the final kilometre to win the fastest ever stage in the Vuelta a España at 55.176km/h and hencing coining his nickname, Speedy González.|$|E
25|$|Theism {{generally}} {{holds that}} God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and {{interacting with the}} universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present {{in the affairs of}} the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, {{due to the nature of}} time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism.Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> what was necessary to create it. In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.|$|E

500|$|A common {{belief in}} Europe {{during this period}} was the Aristotelian idea that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> the Moon and planets was immutable.

However Tycho noted that the object remained stationary from night to night—never changing its parallax—so it must lie far away.

500|$|After {{learning}} she {{had been}} cast, Reed hired a personal trainer and practiced a healthier diet to prepare herself for her revealing costumes in which she exposes her midriff as the character. In the musical, Jasmine resembles an even stronger, more spirited character than the film version, specifically {{the way in which}} she fights against marriage laws and men who wish to control her. Reed believes her character changed the most during workshops as the show traveled from Seattle to Toronto, and finally Broadway, including the replacement of an original musical number with [...] "These Palace Walls", which composer Alan Menken wrote specifically for Reed. Described by Reed as [...] "a really beautiful song" [...] that [...] "sets up her character", [...] "These Palace Walls" [...] narrates Jasmine's desire to explore <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> the confines of the palace, despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with. Reed originally found performing [...] "A Whole New World" [...] particularly daunting because, as the film's most famous song, [...] "everyone has these very specific ideas of what they think it should look like or sound like", in addition to feeling pressured to match Salonga's performance, of whom she is a fan.|$|E

Purcell later commented that Emerson-Johnson had seamlessly blended a [...] "huge palette of genres and styles", whilst in September 2008, Brendan Q.

[...] Writing in a 1992 article for the journal Science Fiction Studies, David N. Samuelson pointed out that the literary conceit of [...] "assuming human beings are necessary for the universe we know" [...] predated Typewriter in the Sky as well as What Mad Universe (1949) by Fredric Brown. Authors Lionel Fanthorpe and Patricia Fanthorpe wrote in The World's Most Mysterious People (1998) that Hubbard accomplished a difficult task of writing about two different worlds at the same time, [...] "even through the medium of fiction Hubbard succeeds in posing deep metaphysical questions about the mind's interpretation of experiential data, and its response to the questions about the nature of being." [...] Writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1999), John Clute and John Grant characterized the work as the best of Hubbard's stories in the Arabian-fantasy theme. In their book Mysteries and Secrets of Time (2007), Fanthorpe and Fanthorpe place the book within the sub-topic of [...] "the idea of being caught inside someone else's dream". In his 2011 book The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick, author Umberto Rossi analyzed Hubbard's story and called it a parody intended to spoof the experiences of hack writers.|$|E

He recounts the {{importance}} of cricket to himself and his community, the role it played in his education, and the disapproval from his family of his attempt to follow a sporting life along with his academic career, whom he describes as [...] "Puritan". This too, he relates to cricket. James returns to the values imbued with cricket, first into the 19th-century English bourgeois culture of the British public school, and then out into the colonies. He contrasts this with American culture, his own growing radicalism, {{and the fact that}} the values of fair play and acceptance of arbitration without complaint rarely applies in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>beyond</b> the cricket pitch.|$|E
