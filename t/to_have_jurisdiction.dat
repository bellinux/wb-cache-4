5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in the case.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, {{it was the beginning of}} the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over York.|$|E

25|$|The {{court had}} concern {{that there is}} a gray area where certain types of cases would fall through the cracks, because only the U.S. {{military}} appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> On the other hand, Justice Scalia noted, it may be possible, and better, for Congress to remedy that situation, as they have deliberative powers the court does not.|$|E

50|$|The {{role of the}} Committee on Finance is {{very similar}} to that of the House Committee on Ways and Means.

(The House Energy and Commerce Committee <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over Medicaid.) The other difference in terms of power is that all revenue raising measures must originate in the House giving the Ways and Means Committee a slight edge in setting tax policy. In addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over legislation the Committee has extensive oversight powers. It <b>has</b> authority <b>to</b> investigate, review and evaluate existing laws, and the agencies that implement them.|$|R

25|$|The first Forest Management Division <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{over the}} Sundarbans was {{established}} in 1869.

The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893–98.|$|E
25|$|Gregory’s pontificate {{witnessed}} {{the end of}} the iconoclasm controversy in the Byzantine Empire, while Gregory himself promoted the celebration of the feast of All Saints within the Frankish kingdom {{on both sides of the}} Rhine River. Gregory is also known for his appointment of Ansgar as Archbishop of Hamburg and Bremen in 832, and as the apostolic legate to the northern and eastern parts of Europe. On March 31, 837, Gregory sent the Pallium to the Archbishop of Salzburg; he also sent one to Venerius, the Patriarch of Grado, in 828, in support of his claims <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the bishops of Istria. When a synod awarded jurisdiction to Maxentius, the Patriarch of Aquileia, Venerius appealed to Gregory, who supported him. Meanwhile, the Lombard King Lothair backed Maxentius, who forced the bishops of Istria to obey him, while at the same time ignoring Gregory’s orders to cease. Gregory also supported the candidacy of John IV (Bishop of Naples).|$|E

25|$|Immunity from {{suits for}} acts or {{omissions}} in {{the discharge of}} judicial duties can promote the independence of judges in their decision-making. The State Courts Act ("SCA") provides that a judicial officer of the State Courts – that is, a district judge, magistrate, coroner or registrar – may not be sued for any act done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, {{whether or not the}} judge is acting within the limits of his jurisdiction, so long as at the time he in good faith believed himself <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to do or order the act complained of. There is no corresponding statutory provision applicable to Supreme Court judges, but at common law a superior court judge enjoys absolute immunity from personal civil liability in respect of any judicial act which he does in his capacity as a judge. The immunity extends to acts done outside the judge's jurisdiction, so long as he has acted reasonably and believing in good faith that the act was within his powers. Like judicial officers of the State Courts, the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Assistant Registrars and other persons acting judicially in the Supreme Court are given statutory immunity from civil suit.|$|E
25|$|Coroners {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to enquire {{into any}} treasure {{found in their}} districts, and into who are or are suspected to be its finders. Anyone finding an object he or she believes or has reasonable grounds to believe is treasure must notify the coroner for the district in which the object is found within 14 days starting from {{the day after the}} find or, if later, the day on which the finder first believes or has reason to believe the object is treasure. Not doing so is an offence. Inquests are held without a jury unless the coroner decides otherwise. The coroner must notify the British Museum if his or her district is in England, the Department of the Environment if it is in Northern Ireland, or the National Museum Wales if it is in Wales. The coroner must also take reasonable steps to notify any person who appears may have found the treasure; any person who, {{at the time it was}} found, occupied land which it appears may be where the treasure was found; and any other interested persons, including persons involved in the find or having an interest in the land where the treasure was found at that time or since. However, coroners still have no power to make any legal determination as to whether the finder, landowner or occupier of the land has title to the treasure. The courts have to resolve that issue, and may also review coroners' decisions in relation to treasure.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was {{established}} in The Hague (Netherlands) and the Rome Statute provides for the ICC <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a [...] "crime against humanity" [...] for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN. Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.|$|E
2500|$|The Zhangzhou of Chen Yuanguang's {{time was}} a place where dozens of various ethic tribes were mixed {{together}} with ethnic Han peoples. [...] Chen Yuanguang believed that courtesy trumped {{the use of military force}} as a tactic for winning over the local people. [...] In order to strengthen his authority, he submitted an application to the emperor to grant prefecture status to the areas between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. [...] In the second year of the Emperor Ruizong of Tang (686), Wu Zetian approved the application, and issued a decree which granted permission for the creation of the state of Zhangzhou. [...] Zhangzhou was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over Zhangpu and Huaien Counties.

2500|$|The proviso {{that the}} Court was for {{disputes}} {{that could not}} [...] "be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy" [...] never made it require evidence that diplomatic discussions had been attempted before bringing the case. In the Loan Cases, it asserted jurisdiction {{despite the fact that}} there was no alleged breach of international law, and it could not be shown that there was any international element to the claim. The Court justified itself by saying that the Covenant of the League of Nations allowed it <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in cases over [...] "the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of international obligations" [...] and argued that since the fact [...] "may be of any kind", it had jurisdiction if the dispute is one of municipal law. It had been long established that municipal law may be considered as a side point to a dispute over international law, but the Loan Cases discussed municipal law without the application of any international points.|$|E

Griffiths CJ, with whom Barton J relevantly agreed, held that the evidence established a dispute extending over the four States in relation to wages and that the service of the log of claims crystallised this dispute into a claim for a definite sum. Isaacs J held that a clear demand from the union, coupled with the absence of any response from the employers was sufficient, that a [...] "a dispute raised in a formal and complete way is to be taken prima facie as genuine and real".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the latter}} half of the 2nd century, Christianity had spread east {{throughout}} Media, Persia, Parthia, and Bactria. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. By AD 280 the metropolis of Seleucia assumed the title of [...] "Catholicos" [...] and in A.D. 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the whole church of the East, including India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The seat of the Patriarchate was fixed at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, since this was an important point on the East-West trade routes which extended both to India and China, Java and Japan. Thus the shift of ecclesiastical authority was away from Edessa, which in A.D. 216 had become tributary to Rome. the establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.|$|E
60|$|This {{was rather}} a puzzling {{question}} to answer to an Indian. We white people can very well understand that a human government, which professes, on the principles recognised by civilized nations, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over certain extensive territories that lie in the virgin forest, and which are used only, and that occasionally, by certain savage tribes as hunting-grounds, should deem it right to satisfy those tribes, by purchase, before they parcelled out their lands {{for the purposes of}} civilized life; but, it would not be so easy to make an unsophisticated mind understand that there could be two owners to the same property. The transaction is simple enough to us, and it tells in favour of our habits, for we have the power to grant these lands without 'extinguishing the Indian title,' as it is termed; but it presents difficulties to the understandings of those who are not accustomed to see society surrounded by the multifarious interests of civilization. In point of fact, the Indian purchases give no other title, under our laws, than the right to sue out, in council, a claim to acquire by, the grant of the crown; paying to the latter such a consideration as in its wisdom it shall see fit to demand. Still, it was necessary to make some answer to the Onondago's question, lest he might carry away the mistaken notion that we did not justly own our possessions.|$|E
