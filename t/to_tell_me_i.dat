500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] {{snapped the}} visitor; [...] "anything <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> suppose. We {{were to be}} married by special license. Iâ€™d even got my trousseau ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want YOU <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that. Here <b>I</b> am, with youth, health, strength, money, every {{blessing of}} life but one; and I am utterly miserable. I want some one <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> want.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. [Angrily.] You dare <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> have no imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear brother:' {{she laid}} her head down on his pillow, and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself: 'is there nothing that you have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>Is</b> there nothing you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if you will? You can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing that will change <b>me.</b> O Tom, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the truth!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Behaving very well? Is {{that all}} you have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>I</b> don't believe you said a proper word to her. You are conspiring {{together}} to kill me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is my solicitor," [...] Laverick answered, [...] "and {{is entirely}} in my confidence. If you have {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> should like Mr. Bellamy also to hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|He only, at this, like a {{buffeting}} swimmer, gave a {{shake of}} his head and repeated his question. [...] "Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> must marry such a woman?" ...|$|E
60|$|Surprised at this speech, <b>I</b> {{begged him}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> {{had said that}} was wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{something}} seems <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> ain't {{long for}} this world," [...] continued Mr. Clarkson, eyeing him with some disfavour.|$|R
60|$|Kate laughed; {{then she}} was pleased <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> was <b>to</b> {{consider}} myself the friend {{of all of the}} name.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} of Maggie, and at last I yearned for her. I {{wanted to see her}} happy--and it doesn't strike me I find you too shy <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> SHALL." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trying {{to get my}} goat again, eh?" [...] she retorted. [...] "I suppose that's what you're after. Going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, that it wasn't Craig I saw board this steamer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Emma," [...] said he, {{moving from}} his chair into one close by her, [...] "you are not going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> hope, that you had not a {{pleasant}} evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. But {{you said}} {{when we were}} getting up this morning that you had {{something}} you wished <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> before <b>I</b> left?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no need}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so. <b>I</b> {{had already}} broken out into a desolate cry, and felt an orphan in the wide world.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are here}} in my room, at the Servants' Club," [...] Quest replied. [...] "You are just about <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where <b>I</b> shall find Lenora." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy, {{you must}} be daft, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> don't know when I bring down a deer. The deer is mine, and if you shot at him you wasted your powder, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, I neither know nor care," [...] was the {{surprising}} answer, wearily delivered. [...] "If {{it is for}} my entertainment that you propose <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> beg you'll spare yourself the trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Money never counts here," [...] {{the doctor}} replied gravely. [...] "We shall save him {{if it is}} possible. You've nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, as to how he met with his wound?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you can't {{help me to}} {{pay this}} debt off,--and you have come only <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> may be accused of roguery?" [...] says Harry.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{between man}} and woman," [...] she answered, [...] "it would be too terribly--er--indecent for you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> why <b>I</b> shouldn't go alligatoring. Good-night. Sleep well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ponder it," [...] said he. [...] "It {{is an easy}} matter <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> should do. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> rather, {{how it should be}} done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can't. But {{what you can}} do is <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> am right-- to give me an attestation, as it were." [...] And the Doctor {{accompanied}} this remark with another professional smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{have you}} also {{followed}} me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> am wrong--of course I am wrong--I am wrong because I will not submit, {{as you and}} Charles do, to ignorant boors like Stofflet and Cathelineau, because--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{thinking}} of something new and pleasant <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> hope,--something in keeping with this quiet place and hour," [...] said Sylvia, glancing {{up at him with}} the traitorous softness still in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{understand}} {{all that you}} would say. I do not want ordinary words <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> count you among my best friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE [interrupting]. Ho! respectable! How did {{you pick}} up Mangan? How {{did you pick}} up my husband? You have the audacity <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> am a--a--a-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she owned}} {{she had a}} trouble, and promised <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> by-and-by. <b>I</b> said no more, for I think I know it," [...] and Jo told her little story.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> know. I knew it {{the moment}} you came in. There was {{something}} on your face, something I haven't seen there for a long, long time. It was an old look." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use my {{thinking}} about it, Mary," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, resignedly, [...] "especially as I suppose you are going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> have made one suggestion, {{and it seems that}} it is incorrect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{learned to}} flatter since the old days, haven't you? Don't you {{remember}} you used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was too thin to be pretty? But I suppose {{a bit of}} blarney is a necessary ingredient {{in the composition of}} an M.P." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are my protector, sir," [...] I cried. [...] "And if it {{please you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>I</b> now stand accused of, I submit most dutifully to your chastisement." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{can think}} of my emotion, my friends, as I listened to these words. I embraced the brave Fourneau, and implored him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how <b>I</b> could assist him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why did {{you write}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> come as he {{was not at all}} well?" [...] she inquired, with a lifting of her {{delicate}} eyebrows.|$|R
