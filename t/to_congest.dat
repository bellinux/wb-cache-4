He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle.

50|$|The Oxford Valley Mall is at {{the center}} of a vibrant {{commercial}} retail area. The area surrounding the mall has grown and has changed significantly in the past twenty years. Mainly car dealerships and car automotive shops were once the only structures around the mall. Today over 30 car dealerships remain, but many have been demolished for the new waves. Over 40 restaurant chains are in the vicinity, along with many major retail stores, such as Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Staples, and Barnes & Noble. A surplus of furniture stores are also located here, along with various hotel chains, a major hospital, and office buildings. Many homes have been constructed around the mall, the oldest being Langhorne Gardens, a branch of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Many newly constructed townhouses, condos, and large single-family homes have been built. Traffic has become a major concern. Nearby U.S. 1 and Interstate 95 allow commuters <b>to</b> <b>congest</b> the mall area roads, along with the surplus of residents in the area. Over 400,000 people reside less than ten minutes from the mall, plus the many commuters from nearby New Jersey. Many major construction projects are planned for the major access roads.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} a defense system to contain DDoS flooding attacks in high-speed networks.

DDoS flooding attacks tend to establish large numbers of malicious traffic flows <b>to</b> <b>congest</b> network. These flows are marked as TCP flows, and use spoofed source identifiers to hide their identities. The current network equipments are lack of the countermeasure capacity to such kind of DDoS attack and do not provide the mechanisms to support the extension of the new DDoS attack countermeasures. We adopt a gateway-based approach. A set of gateways are deployed at different location in the network to collaboratively perform the desired countermeasure functions such as attack detection and traffic access control. I...|$|E
40|$|It is {{predicted}} {{that by the}} year 2000, U. S. cellular carriers will invest billions of dollars for cellular billing and customer care. Two of the most desirable attributes of the cellular billing systems are the flexibility of upgrade and ability to inform the billing experts quickly about the status of the system to minimize any possible fraud and improve customer service. Although the second attribute can be realized by reporting the billing customer record in real time, this tends <b>to</b> <b>congest</b> the signaling channel, which is not desirable. In this paper, we propose several schemes for the provision of a quick billing status report which maintains low-signaling traffic. The performance of these schemes is derived analytically. We expect that these results may provide a guideline for the future design of on-line billing systems in personal communication services (PCS's) networks...|$|E

40|$|OVERVIEW: Providing {{safe and}} secure {{transport}} is the most basic principle of railroads, and this is made possible by train control systems. Drawing on its expertise in information control technologies, Hitachi has made enormous strides in addressing user needs by developing digital ATC (automatic train control) systems for application <b>to</b> <b>congested</b> rail lines, reducing train headways, improving passenger comfort with one-step brake control, {{reducing the amount of}} track-side equipment, and many other initiatives. However, these innovations are not just confined <b>to</b> <b>congested</b> routes, for every line can benefit from improved safety and lower costs for track-side equipment and maintenance. To meet these needs, it is essential to achieve closer cooperation between track-side and on-board systems than in the past, and to develop train control systems with the flexibility to run autonomously. Leveraging its expertise and technological edge, Hitachi is moving boldly to develop new systems and a wide range of solutions calculated to enhance rail services in the near-term future...|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{community}} is {{very interested in}} addressing congestion with active queue management mechanisms like Random Early Detection (RED). Recent proposals extend these mechanisms to actively penalize "misbehaving " flows. These methods favor TCP and TCP-like flows strongly over other flows like UDP. In this paper we propose extensions to active queue management disciplines which continue to address congestion and reward TCPfriendly flows while minimizing impact on continuous media flows using other protocols. Our mechanism, Drop Preference Management (DPM), recognizes tagged flows and manages their latency while constraining the bandwidth they consume. We present empirical results of experiments comparing our mechanism to plain RED. 1.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of the low voltage (LV) power lines for smart grid applications involving data transfer in a specific narrow, low frequency band. We propose an analytical approach to obtain the line's transfer function and conduct simulation to determine the performance of the LV PLC system in terms of bit error rate. We then evaluate the performance of the medium access control protocol (MAC) for the LV PLC network taking into account its physical characteristic and performance limitation. We show by simulation that packet loss in this network can be significant even with a light traffic condition due to the noisy channel, and the goodput declines sharply once the individual transmission rate is high enough <b>to</b> <b>congest</b> the network. We also show that the channel errors can be reduced by adjusting the MAC parameters to allow the retransmissions recouping losses...|$|E

Second, we decompose successfully generated traffic into its constituent parts, namely, induced travel and diverted travel. We also identify the source of each component. Next, we document statistically significant changes in the spatial distribution of traffic flows in the vicinities of the new expressways and throughout the entire network. Finally, our analysis of traffic congestion and vehicular emissions of three pollutants (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides) suggests that while the new expressways may prove beneficial to the system as a whole, {{this is not the case}} for their immediate environs. ...|$|E
