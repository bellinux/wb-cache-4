60|$|Forester acted very wisely in {{not keeping}} the {{attention}} of the crew very long at a time. By relieving them very frequently, he made the distinction between being under orders and at ease a very marked and striking one, so that the boys easily kept it in mind. In a few moments he commanded attention again, with the same success as before. He then ordered another boy to toss his oar, then another, and so on, until he had taught the movement to each one separately. He gave to each one such explanations as he needed, and when necessary he made them perform the evolution twice, so as to be sure that each one understood exactly what was to be done. Then Forester gave the command for them all to <b>toss</b> <b>together,</b> and they did so quite successfully. The oars rose and stood perpendicularly like so many masts; while Forester paddled the boat slowly through the water. Then he directed the boys to let the oars down again, gently, to their places along the thwarts, and put the crew at ease.|$|E
60|$|The {{time that}} cost them {{appeared}} interminable, {{but it became}} evident that a few at least {{of those who had}} gained an entry into the town were firing on the cazadores who held the mouth of the carretera, and in another minute or two they swept up to it and stopped again, gasping in the smoke, with high white walls above them, and a mound of soil and torn‐up pavement meshed with wires close in front of them. Tony remembered he had heard that in these days of magazine rifles and hopper‐fed guns an attack of the kind was foredoomed to fail, but it seemed that the Sin Verguenza meant to try it, for already Maccario was half‐way up the slope, with Appleby, pistol in hand, close behind him, and while a savage cry went up a wave of scrambling men seemed to <b>toss</b> <b>together</b> and roll on. It swept up to the crest of the barrier, and plunged into the smoke, and the cazadores wavered, turned, and fled. They were outnumbered, and, as it transpired later, had been galled by a fire from the roofs above, while Appleby eventually discovered a cartridge partly torn to pieces stuck immovably in the chamber of their quick‐firing gun.|$|E
6000|$|Here I lay for {{the space}} of many days a close prisoner, and not only got my health again, but came to know my companions. They were a rough lot indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted {{out of all the}} kindly parts of life, and {{condemned}} to <b>toss</b> <b>together</b> on the rough seas, with masters no less cruel. There were some among them that had sailed with the pirates and seen things {{it would be a shame}} even to speak of; some were men that had run from the king's ships, and went with a halter round their necks, of which they made no secret; and all, as the saying goes, were [...] "at a word and a blow" [...] with their best friends. Yet I had not been many days shut up with them before I began to be ashamed of my first judgment, when I had drawn away from them at the Ferry pier, as though they had been unclean beasts. No class of man is altogether bad, but each has its own faults and virtues; and these shipmates of mine were no exception to the rule. Rough they were, sure enough; and bad, I suppose; but they had many virtues. They were kind when it occurred to them, simple even beyond the simplicity of a country lad like me, and had some glimmerings of honesty.|$|E

60|$|June 10th.--My {{wife and}} I {{went to the}} Pitti Palace to-day; and first entered a court where, yesterday, she had seen a carpet of flowers, {{arranged}} for some great ceremony. It {{must have been a}} most beautiful sight, the pavement of the court being entirely covered by them, in a regular pattern of brilliant lines, so as really to be a living mosaic. This morning, however, the court had nothing but its usual stones, and the show of yesterday seemed so much the more inestimable as having been so evanescent. Around the walls of the court there were still some pieces of splendid tapestry which had made part of yesterday's magnificence. We went up the staircase, of regally broad and easy ascent, and made application to be admitted to see the grand-ducal apartments. An attendant accordingly took the keys, and ushered us first into a great hall with a vaulted ceiling, and then through a series of noble rooms, with rich frescos above and mosaic floors, hung with damask, adorned with gilded chandeliers, and glowing, in short, with more gorgeousness than I could have imagined beforehand, or can now remember. In many of the rooms were those superb antique cabinets which I admire more than any other furniture ever invented; only these were of unexampled art and glory, inlaid with precious stones, and with beautiful Florentine mosaics, both of flowers and landscapes,--each cabinet worth a lifetime's toil to make it, and the cost a whole palace to pay for it. Many of the rooms were covered with arras, of landscapes, hunting-scenes, mythological subjects, or historical scenes, equal to pictures in truth of representation, and possessing an indescribable richness that makes them preferable as a mere adornment of princely halls and chambers. Some of the rooms, as I have said, were laid in mosaic of stone and marble, otherwise in lovely patterns of various woods; others were covered with carpets, delightful to tread upon, and glowing like the living floor of flowers which my wife saw yesterday. There were tables, too, of Florentine mosaic, the mere materials of which--lapis lazuli, malachite, pearl, and a hundred other precious things--were worth a fortune, and made a thousand times more valuable by the artistic skill of the manufacturer. I <b>toss</b> <b>together</b> brilliant words by the handful, and make a rude sort of patchwork, but can record no adequate idea of what I saw in this suite of rooms; and the taste, the subdued splendor, so that it did not shine too high, but was all tempered into an effect at once grand and soft,--this was quite as remarkable as the gorgeous material. I have seen a very dazzling effect produced in the principal cabin of an American clipper-ship quite opposed to this in taste.|$|E

[...] Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood called him [...] "something of a cult hero {{thanks to his}} brilliant and demented pop records." [...] A 2009 profile of Hughes in The Believer called Hughes [...] "one of the best pop songwriters in America, a musical autodidact and a heavy-hearted leonine balladeer whose confessions from the world off 277 will break your heart." [...] A lengthy 2014 profile by New York music critic Jody Rosen commented that Hughes's extensive following among other musicians and other celebrities was such that [...] "he may have as many famous admirers as civilian ones", and praised his songs for [...] "the way they <b>toss</b> <b>together</b> zingy pop-culture references and traditionalist songcraft; their blend of hepcat shagginess and poetic precision; and especially the mix of wry and lavishly romantic, of tongue-in-cheek and heart-on-sleeve." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{green salad}} or garden salad {{is most often}} {{composed}} of leafy vegetables such as lettuce varieties, spinach, or rocket (arugula). The salad leaves may be cut or torn into bite-sized fragments and <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> (called a <b>tossed</b> salad), or may {{be placed in a}} predetermined arrangement (a composed salad).

Accordingly, as Miriam bade him, he tried to turn his attention to a great pile and confusion of pen and ink sketches and pencil drawings which lay <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> on a table.

500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. The Arizona Republic critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that [...] "the movie {{is a series of}} distractions <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens." [...] Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script [...] "little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces", and USA Todays Claudia Puig found On Stranger Tides [...] "familiar and predictable...often incoherent and crammed with pointless details." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ingredients}} used {{vary widely}} by region, restaurant, seasonal availability, and/or preference of the preparer. The salad {{can be as}} simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several pastas <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. Additional types of pasta may be used, such as ditalini. These can include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood. [...] Broccoli, carrots, baby corn, cucumbers, olives, onions, beans, chick peas, peppers, and parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars.|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Spence D. {{noted that}} [...] "the song {{is a mixed}} bag, <b>tossing</b> <b>together</b> slick strings for that orchestrated pop vibe, then mixing that up with a loping, though downplayed, funk groove.

[...] According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the [...] "girl-empowerment song" [...] has a time signature set in common time, with a tempo of 104 beats per minute. The melody is mainly composed with cinematic strings and features a sitar in the middle eighth, and uses stomping, custom-made beat.|$|R

I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and invisible, but quivering with anger, to watch events. They split a panel, I saw, and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway.

But the real mystery is why such a mangled film was not junked altogether." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said the film is [...] "a horror movie so vague about the nightmare it’s spinning, it seems scared of its own shadows... Darkness was clearly <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> like salad in the editing room, since it’s {{little more than the}} sum of its unshocking shock cuts." [...] The Village Voice also gave the film a middling review, saying [...] "Moments hint at a metaphoric statement on child abuse, but the film proves mainly to be a commentary on poor electrical wiring." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} on deck, {{but it was}} very perilous, for the vessel was so low in the water that the waves dashed over it so wildly that he could hardly help being swept away. It was pitch dark, too, and the lantern of the other vessel could only just be seen, now high above their heads, now sinking in the trouble of the sea, while the little tartane was lifted up as though on a mountain; and in a kind of giddy dream, he thought of falling headlong upon her deck. Finally he found himself falling. Was he washed overboard? No; a sharp blow showed him that he had only fallen down the hatchway, and after lying still a moment, he heard the voices of Lanty and Hebert, and presently they were all <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> by another lurch of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|Nashville duo Wild Cub did a {{cover of}} this song. Dale Lavine of Hootingandhowling.com said the {{following}} about it: [...] "Tasteful and rustic, no doubt. Piano melodies fall over a solid beat, all <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> with that soulfully gruff voice that has made bands like Alabama Shakes and Imagine Dragons rise to relative infamy. The {{same could be said}} for Wild Cub, who are well on their way to becoming another big name. Their cover of ‘Running’, along with so many of their other songs, presents an atmosphere of that classic romantic melancholy while retaining modern pop-esque rhythms". Elliott Batte of Stereoboard.com called it an [...] "atmospheric, piano based jam carried by the ever impressive vocal of Keegan DeWitt. The end result is a reworking of the track which pays direct homage to the original while featuring the attributes that have made Wild Cub {{one of the most exciting}} new bands in circulation currently".|$|R
60|$|The {{room into}} which the Master of Cumnor Place {{conducted}} his worthy visitant was of greater extent than that {{in which they had}} at first conversed, and had yet more the appearance of dilapidation. Large oaken presses, filled with shelves of the same wood, surrounded the room, and had, at one time, served for the arrangement of a numerous collection of books, many of which yet remained, but torn and defaced, covered with dust, deprived of their costly clasps and bindings, and <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> in heaps upon the shelves, as things altogether disregarded, and abandoned to the pleasure of every spoiler. The very presses themselves seemed to have incurred the hostility of those enemies of learning who had destroyed the volumes with which they had been heretofore filled. They were, in several places, dismantled of their shelves, and otherwise broken and damaged, and were, moreover, mantled with cobwebs and covered with dust.|$|R

40|$|This {{review of}} an {{international}} conference on Foucault - the Legacy, is written in five voices. The purpose of the review is to suggest that 'new' centres and margins are being created {{in the wake of}} Michel Foucault's efforts to rupture such boundaries. It is posited that these boundary markings are the result of dominant academic discourses, the business of organising conferences, and the wider cultural context. When several hundred disparate voices are <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> for three days in a reified location to discuss the impact, scope and ramifications of high theory, the results are bound to be controversial. So, what are the 'new' centres? Well, in many ways they are the old centres - white, masculine, middle class, and intellectual dressed in new post-structural clothes. And the new margins - well, they are the old margins - the feminine, among others, and perhaps this is what is so surprising, given twenty years of scholarship since Foucault, aimed to redress this subalternity in a field of knowledge that was to have ended subalternity...|$|R
5000|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, likening {{it to the}} films of Ken Russell. Speaking of director James Lapine's approach, Maslin said, [...] "Handling this material playfully, he <b>tosses</b> <b>together</b> the film's artistic luminaries and allows them to indulge in outrageous antics, like the scene that finds Sand pleading for Chopin's affections and telling him she needs only a minute of his time to explain her feelings." [...] The New Yorker reviewer wrote that the film was [...] "an ebullient and absurdly entertaining account of the famous love affair of George Sand and Frédéric Chopin. ...The historical figures in this movie are cartoons, but they’re cartoons with recognizable human qualities, and the actors {{look as if they}} were having a wonderful time charging around in their period costumes. Hugh Grant’s Chopin is a brilliant caricature of the Romantic ideal of the artist; he gives the character an air of befuddled unworldliness, and punctuates his readings with delicately timed tubercular coughs. Judy Davis plays Sand—a great actress in a great role." ...|$|R

40|$|In a {{reflective}} and richly entertaining piece from 1979, Doug Hofstadter famously imagined {{a conversation between}} “Achilles ” and an anthill (the eponymous “Aunt Hillary”), in which he playfully explored many ideas and themes related to cognition and consciousness. For Hofstadter, the anthill is able {{to carry on a}} conversation because the ants that compose it play roughly the same role neurons play in the brain. Unfortunately, Hofstadter ‘s work is notably short on detail suggesting how this magic might be achieved; it is as if, as Drew McDermott writes in the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness, “he wants to invent a new, playful style of argumentation, in which concepts are broken up and <b>tossed</b> <b>together</b> into so many configurations that the original question one might have asked get shunted aside”. “Swarm intelligence ” is a relatively new branch of Artificial Intelligence that realigns intelligence away from the individual towards the collective; its aim is to illustrate intelligent behaviour by considering individuals in a social context and monitoring their interaction with one another as well as with their environment.
