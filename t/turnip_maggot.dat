50|$|Several {{important}} {{agricultural pests}} are Delia species, including D. radicum, the cabbage maggot, D. floralis, the <b>turnip</b> <b>maggot,</b> and D. antiqua, the onion maggot. The larvae of these flies, which tunnel into roots and stems of host plants, can cause considerable agricultural yield losses. Although {{most members of}} this genus have larvae that feed on stems, flowers, and fruits of plants, a few others have larvae that are leaf miners. The larvae of Afrotropical Delia species are mainly phytophagous, and {{have been found in}} various cereal crops and grasses, including Cynodon, Secale, Hordeum, Setaria, Pennisetum, Chloris, Sorghum, and Eleusine species.|$|E

40|$|Crucifer root-feeding maggots {{occur in}} field Brassica crops across the prairies, causing the {{greatest}} damage to canola fields {{in central and}} northern Alberta. No chemical options are available for their control in canola. Seed treatments currently utilized for flea beetle control are not efficacious against root maggots, and flies emerge over extended periods, making application of insecticide sprays impractical. Biological and cultural practices are the primary methods of root maggot management in canola. Fall cultivation, the use of vigorous canola cultivars, increased seeding rates, wider row spacings, and suitable fertilization regimes will aid in diminishing root maggot damage. Because natural enemies are an important means of root maggot control, research is needed into co-ordinating cultural management practices with biological control strategies for maximum effectiveness of both strategies and a truly integrated crop management approach to maggot control. Species Composition and Host Range The crucifer-feeding Delia root maggot complex that attacks canola on the prairies comprises five species. Cabbage maggot D. radicum (L.), <b>turnip</b> <b>maggot</b> D. floralis (Fall.), and seedcorn maggot D. platura (Meig.), are frequently encountered, while bean see...|$|E
