2500|$|According to the Chicago Tribune, an {{investigation}} began in May after police {{were informed that}} fighting dogs were being bred and raised at the home. Two workers for an animal shelter {{said that they had}} tipped off police. Officials close to the investigation confirmed their role. Neighbors told the news media that they had also called police to complain about barking from the barn and what was described as [...] "a stench" [...] by several. One neighbor said that he had called police several months ago after seeing a dog chained in the yard on a hot day without water. Another neighbor who lives across the street told reporters that he began seeing police in unmarked cars watching the home several weeks earlier, and one investigator had interviewed him about a week before the raid. The Tribune reported that the neighbor said that he told the investigator [...] "...the place was like a gas station, people coming and going constantly at night...I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was dealing drugs." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Menzel {{said that}} Arnold may have merely seen spots {{of water on}} his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's {{testimony}} that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the East Oregonian has Arnold saying he at first <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was seeing reflections off his window, but [...] "he still saw the objects after rolling it down." ...|$|R
60|$|I ran to {{the door}} to meet him, feeling that I would have given a deal to have him back in Edinburgh again. He came running, waving a paper over his head; and I <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> had a note from Edie, and that it was all known to him. But as he came up I saw that it was a big, stiff, yellow paper which {{crackled}} as he waved it, and that his eyes were dancing with happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "What person?" [...] She <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was {{alluding}} to {{the lady in the}} sledge. The chaperon was not showy, but, what is better, she was good. And, anyhow, it was the best the girls had been able to do. So far as they were concerned, they had no use for a chaperon. The idea had been a thoughtful concession to European prejudice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{as he was}} any {{particular}} friend.

Well, yer honor, I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was going to play a tune, when he lifts up the top of the basket and then began to play. Ye may call it music, yer honor, but there was nayther tune nor music in it.|$|E
5000|$|ABC {{told the}} AP that each open {{position}} had around twenty viable candidates vying for it, who auditioned by sitting with Al Michaels (whom ABC had retained) and 'calling' the previous season AFC playoff game between Tennessee and Buffalo. Miller auditioned on June 12, 2000 sitting with Michaels in a Los Angeles studio {{to do such}} a mock broadcast. Miller's NFL knowledge surprised those in attendance as {{he had grown up}} watching the 1970s championship Steelers and was an avid watcher of the NFL draft—he had even inquired about an announcing job with FOX after they had acquired rights to show NFL games in 1994. Michael's later told an interviewer [...] "It was way beyond what we expected. I had no idea that he knew as much about football as he did. He made points that other analysts we brought in never made, and his points were more salient, more interesting and better stated. He was giving his riff, analyzing the plays and providing the humor. Amazing would not be an overstatement. Then I <b>thought,</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>he's</b> shooting his wad here, and that's all we're going to get. But he kept going. Hell, it was almost perfect. Don and I {{looked at each other and}} said, 'Wow. Where did this come from?'" ...|$|R
60|$|He was a {{nice young}} man of prepossessing {{appearance}} and amiable manners. They could not call to mind his name, but remembered having met him, somewhere, and {{on more than one}} occasion. The American girl is always sociable: they bowed and smiled, and said it was a fine day. He replied with volubility, and helped them down on to the ice. He was really most attentive. They saw their friend, the officer of noble family, and, {{with the assistance of the}} German gentleman, skated towards him. He glided past them. They <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> did not know enough to stop, so they turned and skated after him. They chased him three times round the pond and then, feeling tired, eased up and took counsel together.|$|R
5000|$|Fred Dryer later {{appeared}} as Dave Richards, one of Sam Malone's {{friends and a}} sports commentator, in Cheers. Danson said: I {{had no idea how}} unintelligent Sam was. At first I thought he was making thesebecause Sam would come out with these things that were funny, and I <b>thought,</b> well, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> being ironic. You know, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> smart enough to know that he's saying stupid things in the beginning. I think it took me {{about a year and a}} half before ... I had an inkling on how to play Sam Malone, because he was a relief pitcher, which comes with a certain amount of arrogance. You know, you only get called in when you're in trouble and you're there to save the day, and that takes a special kind of arrogance, I think. And Sam Malone had that arrogance. And I, Ted Danson, did not. I was nervous, scared, excited about, you know, grateful about my new job. Ted Danson ...|$|R
6000|$|When the dodo {{came along}} {{he thought it}} was a wildcat--I saw it in his eye. But I saved him. And I was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride. I just spoke up in a quite natural way of {{pleasing}} surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information, and said, [...] "Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!" [...] I explained--without seeming to be explaining--how I know it for a dodo, and although I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me. That was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept. How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it! ...|$|E
60|$|But all lesser sin {{sinks into}} insignificance beside the {{lawlessness}} of George. The bicycle incident had thrown us all into confusion, {{with the result}} that we lost George altogether. It transpired subsequently that he was waiting for us outside the police court; but this at the time we did not know. We <b>thought,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> had gone on to Baden by himself; and anxious to get away from Carlsruhe, and not, perhaps, thinking out things too clearly, we jumped into the next train that came up and proceeded thither. When George, tired of waiting, returned to the station, he found us gone and he found his luggage gone. Harris had his ticket; I was acting as banker to the party, so that he had in his pocket only some small change. Excusing himself upon these grounds, he thereupon commenced deliberately a career of crime that, reading it later, as set forth baldly in the official summons, made the hair of Harris and myself almost to stand on end.|$|E
6000|$|Why, {{that simple}} old Laxart sat {{up there and}} droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave a thought to the badness of the {{etiquette}} of it, or ever suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history. There was not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it distressing and pathetic, {{it was in fact}} not pathetic at all, but actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, I know it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that he could have laughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel Rainguesson said the same. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral there at Domremy two or three weeks back. He had spots all over his face and hands, and he got Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and while she was doing it, and comforting him, and trying to say pitying things to him, he told her how it happened. And first he asked her if she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came away, and she said indeed she did, and he was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well?--and just drowned him in questions about that creature. And {{he said it was a}} young bull now, and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal hand at a funeral; and she said, [...] "The bull?" [...] and he said, [...] "No, myself"; but said the bull did take a hand, but not because of his being invited, for he wasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his back; and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, and saw the young bull grazing there, and <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> could ride part way on him and gain time; so he tied a rope around the bull's body to hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, and jumped on and started; but it was all new to the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it was getting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way; and just in the edge of the village he knocked down some beehives, and the bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soared along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them, and made them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and here they came roaring through the village like a hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in the center, and sent that section of it sprawling, and galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction, every person with a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then he turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazed way at Joan where she had her face in a cushion, dying, apparently, and says: ...|$|E
5000|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the owners of the}} Spanish and Indian Trading Company decided to switch to war-related opportunities, and in 1943 the company closed down, putting McKibbin out of a job. Then in March 1943, she was approached by three men from California seeking to establish a new office in Santa Fe, who offered to hire her as a secretary. She was particularly impressed by one of them. She later wrote: I thought to be associated with that person, whoever he was, would be simply great! I never met a person with a magnetism that hit you so fast and so completely as his did. I didn't know what <b>he</b> did. I <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> if <b>he</b> were digging trenches to put in a new road, I would love to do that, or if he were soliciting ads for a magazine or something, I would love to do that. I just wanted to be allied and {{have something to do with}} a person of such vitality and radiant force.|$|R
5000|$|In The Jungle Book 2, he is {{voiced by}} Bob Joles and reappears as the mature Bagheera. He tries {{to reason with}} a {{depressed}} Baloo that Mowgli's place is in the Man Village, and that the jungle is not safe for him because Shere Khan has returned to get revenge on Mowgli for humiliating him, but Baloo is certain that with their help, Mowgli can handle the tiger a second time, and bypasses Bagheera. Frustrated, he calls upon Colonel Hathi and his troops to block Baloo's path. When the villagers try to find Mowgli, he suspects that Baloo has brought him back; he confronts Baloo with the news and expresses his <b>thoughts</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> has seen him. Baloo hides Mowgli from Bagheera and convinces Bagheera {{that he is not}} with him, although Bagheera does not entirely believe it. He appears again later on, when Mowgli's younger adoptive brother Ranjan and Baloo are hurrying to save Mowgli from Shere Khan, and joins them. When they reach the temple built on a lava lake, Bagheera waits outside with Ranjan and warns Baloo to be careful before he goes inside to help Mowgli. After Shere Khan is trapped, Mowgli introduces Bagheera to Shanti, the girl who is Mowgli's best friend at the village. Near the end of the film, Ranjan is shown playing with Bagheera's tail. At first Bagheera is scared, but he later enjoys playing with him while Mowgli, Shanti, and Baloo sing the reprise of [...] "The Bare Necessities".|$|R
5000|$|When I saw {{my father}} as a {{recording}} engineer ... I was enamored. Looking at how my father was so reverential to those people, I <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> could look at me {{with that kind of}} respect if I could get behind a microphone. — Stern on his father's influence Stern wished to be in radio at the age of five. He was an infrequent listener in his youth, but names talk personalities Bob Grant and Brad Crandall as early influences. His father set up a microphone, tape machine and turntable in the basement of his home which Stern used to record his own make believe radio shows, incorporating different characters and pre-recorded prank calls, sketches, and commercials. He made several visits to his father's recording studio and witnessed [...] "some of the great voice guys" [...] work with him, including Don Adams and Larry Storch voice Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, which began his desire to be on the air and [...] "do a show", rather than play records. In the late 1960s, Roosevelt became a predominantly black area; Stern remembered just [...] "a handful of white kids" [...] had remained in his school and repeated instances of bullying from black pupils. In June 1969, the family moved to nearby Rockville Centre, and Stern, at age fifteen, transferred to South Side High School where he became [...] "a total introvert". He graduated from the school in 1972; his year book lists Stern's sole student activity, a membership in Key Club.|$|R
