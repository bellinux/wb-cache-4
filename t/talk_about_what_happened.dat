50|$|The {{point of}} view is third person limited objective: Dubus tells {{everything}} from a neutral {{point of view}}, he <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to Mitchell with no interjections. He intentionally withholds information for a dramatic effect. Since this type of narration is the most common, it fits in with the type of story, {{and the fact that it}} could happen to anyone.|$|R

5000|$|... “Trauma-informed” {{is based}} on the {{understanding}} that the impact of violent experiences and damaging relationships affects not only the survivor’s physical, mental, emotional, and economic wellbeing, but the spiritual as well. Trauma’s isolating impact makes relationships more difficult. <b>Talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> may feel too vulnerable and risky. Removing the weight of trauma from the soul isn’t easy. But healing often arises when other creative forms of expression are embraced. New connections and relationships are forged - and without the limitations of communicating solely through language.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{techniques}} in utilizing {{these and other}} pieces of evidence loosely resemble the use of circumstantial evidence in murder cases (in which, of course, the victim is never available to testify).

Likewise, statements from the Defendant in the case, such as to police officers or detectives, might be introduced to show inconsistencies or admissions about the abuse.|$|E
50|$|In June 2006, the New York Times {{reported}} that 19 villagers had been prosecuted for the unrest, 7 being given long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the Police. This {{was taken to}} be evidence of the Chinese government covering up {{the true nature of}} the shootings. The trial was not widely reported on and locals said that they were constantly being pressured not to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in 2005.
