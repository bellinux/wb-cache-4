5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which will be enough to satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored <b>terrorism.</b> <b>That</b> fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E
25|$|Being {{tough on}} terrorism, {{particularly}} {{the sorts of}} homegrown <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means {{making it harder for}} people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible.

25|$|Upon the {{election}} of Donald Trump for {{the presidency of the}} U.S., in 2017, the latter passed an executive order for a ban on citizens from seven countries with suspected links to <b>terrorism,</b> <b>that</b> concerns three African countries. During the 28th African Union Summit, in Ethiopia, African leaders criticized the Ban as they expressed their growing concerns for the African Economy, under Trump's policies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, Bush gained {{widespread}} political support as he pursued the War on <b>Terrorism</b> <b>that</b> included the invasion of Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, Bush ordered for an invasion of Iraq because of breakdown of United Nations sanctions and intelligence indicating programs to rebuild or develop new weapons of mass destruction. Bush had near-unanimous Republican support in Congress plus support from many Democratic leaders.|$|E
25|$|Enders Walter and Todd Sandler theorized in a 2006 {{book on the}} {{political}} economy of <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> it provided a model for the terrorist bombings of the 1980s. In another 2006 book, Gus Martin wrote that the attack {{is one of the best}} historical examples of successful terrorism, it having yielded, according to him, everything that the Irgun had wanted. He went on to compare the aftermath of the bombing to that of Carlos Marighella's campaign with the Brazilian Communist Party.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} of <b>terrorism</b> <b>that’s</b> plaguing {{different}} parts of the Northeast as the backdrop. Silajit Majumder, a militant on the run, takes refuge in a dilapidated mansion. Roopa Ganguly stays there with her father-in-law Soumitra Chatterjee and his father Haradhan Bandopadhyay who’s confined to bed and is unable to speak. This film focuses on the friction and undercurrent of tension between the lady {{of the house and the}} terrorist. It leads to a brief mutual self-discovery that gives rise to compassion.|$|R

25|$|Villarroel {{was overthrown}} in 1946. He {{had been unable}} to {{organize}} popular support and faced opposition from conservative groups and increasing political <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> included murders of the government's opponents. Rivalry between the MNR and the military in the governing coalition also contributed to his downfall. In 1946 mobs of students, teachers, and workers seized arms from the arsenal and moved to the presidential palace. They captured and shot Villarroel and suspended his body from a lamppost in the main square, while the army remained aloof in the barracks.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} episode proved counterproductive {{in several}} respects. It ruined {{the prospects for}} genuine racial partnership, made heroes out of the detainees, and alienated moderate Africans from the Government. Indeed, black opposition at this point started to become violent. Repression of the black majority by the white minority had helped to engender the <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> would haunt the country for decades. To deflate the crisis atmosphere {{of the state of}} emergency and yet preserve its sweeping powers as insurance against the future, the regime sought to normalise the exceptional measures, by incorporating them in statute law. Thus nstitutionalised, the official emergency came to an end.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of the September 11 attacks, a number of bills {{attempting}} to make changes to anti-terrorism laws were introduced into Congress. The first bill proposed was the Combating Terrorism Act of 2001, which was introduced by Republican Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) with Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on September 13. Among its proposed measures, it ordered a report on the readiness of the National Guard to pre-emptively disrupt domestic acts of <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> used {{weapons of mass destruction and}} called for long-term research and development into terrorist attacks. It also called for a review of the authority of Federal agencies to address terrorist acts, proposed a change that would have allowed the CIA to recruit terrorist informants and proposed to allow law enforcement agencies to disclose foreign intelligence that was discovered through wiretaps and other interception methods. The amendment proposed a Sense of Congress that not enough was being done to impede and investigate terrorist fundraising, and sought to increase measures to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of terrorism.|$|E
5000|$|The Security Council reaffirmed <b>that</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} threats to international peace and security and that it could not be associated with any religion, nationality or ethnic group. It acknowledged that military and intelligence operations alone could not defeat <b>terrorism,</b> and <b>that</b> underlying causes should be addressed. There was also concern over the increasing number of abductions and kidnappings by terrorist groups with a political motive.|$|R

25|$|In 1968, El Al {{experienced}} {{the first of}} many acts of <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> have been perpetrated against the airline. On 23 July, the only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place, when a Boeing 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The aircraft, El Al Flight 426, which was en route from Rome to Tel Aviv, was diverted to Algiers by the hijackers. Negotiations with the hijackers lasted for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed. The hijackers were said to have believed Israeli General Ariel Sharon was on the flight. According to Sarah Levy, it was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson who saved Sharon's life, by advising him the night before to take a different flight. On 26 December of the same year, two PFLP members attacked an El Al aircraft at Athens International Airport, killing an Israeli mechanic. The Israeli Defense Forces responded to the incident on 29 December, with a night-time raid on Lebanon's Beirut Airport, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to Middle East Airlines, Trans Mediterranean Airways and Lebanese International Airways. The military action was responsible for the demise of the LIA, which had most of its fleet destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Law {{professor}} Jimmy Gurulé {{said the}} decision [...] "sends a powerful message to rogue states and state sponsors of <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> if you, directly or indirectly, provide material support for terrorism, you will be held accountable"—sentiment echoed by Mark Dubowitz, director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies—and that [...] "hopefully, it's also {{going to have a}} deterrent effect, or least cause Iran to think twice about supporting terrorist activity going forward." [...] The decision was also praised by Senator Bob Menendez, who authored §8772, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.|$|E
500|$|In Muslim societies, {{insulting}} Muhammad {{is considered}} one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the University of Granada, [...] "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as Mohammad Hashim Kamali maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day." [...] In the Quran itself, [...] "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." [...] Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general. According to the BBC, [...] "It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with <b>terrorism,</b> <b>that</b> is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims." [...] This link played into a widespread perception among Muslims across the world that many in the West are hostile towards Islam and Muslims.|$|E
40|$|A central {{hypothesis}} in the articulated rationale inspiring the war {{on terror}} suggests that failed states {{play a key role in}} the international terrorist nexus and require external intervention and guided democratization. This logic is based on two related premises; first that there is a direct link between failed states and international <b>terrorism,</b> second <b>that</b> democratic governance reduces the recourse to terrorism. This article suggests that there is no causal link between failed states and international <b>terrorism</b> and <b>that</b> the asserted ability of democratic governance to catalyze a reduction in terrorism is exaggerated if not wholly inaccurate...|$|R

500|$|Supporters of {{independence}} for Puerto Rico {{argue that the}} U.S. favored {{the establishment of the}} present Commonwealth status to create a perpetual consumer base for U.S. and foreign products and services. Foreign products and services are redirected to Puerto Rico and other [...] "unincorporated" [...] lands of the United States to satisfy a portion of foreign trade agreements, while allowing domestic products and services a greater [...] "home" [...] market share. Another argument by the independence movement is that the Macheteros are continuing the historical rebellion that Puerto Ricans such as Pedro Albizu Campos and the Nationalist Party have waged, against U.S. domination of the island. It is known, for example, that Los Macheteros deliberately chose September 12 for their Águila Blanca assault on the Wells Fargo depot, because September 12 was the birthday of Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Beginning in the 1960s, the FBI infiltrated Puerto Rico's free press and political circles in order to monitor and disrupt efforts related to independence movements like Los Macheteros. This operation was part of COINTELPRO. The EPB's rebuttal to being classified as a terrorist organization is that per the definition adopted in the 1979 Conference on International <b>Terrorism</b> <b>that</b> posits [...] "deliberate, systematic murder, maiming and menacing of the innocent to inspire fear in order to earn political gains", they do not qualify as such since their targets are strictly the American military or law enforcement and that they have never targeted civilians.|$|E
500|$|Another {{persistent}} allegation is {{the direct}} involvement of Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson. He {{was one of}} the men taken in by the RUC in August 1975 and questioned as a suspect in the killings, but was released without charge. The independent panel of inquiry commissioned by the Pat Finucane Centre concluded that there was [...] "credible evidence that the principal perpetrator [...] was a man who was not prosecuted – alleged RUC Special Branch agent Robin Jackson". The same panel revealed that about six weeks before the attack, Thomas Crozier, Jackson, and the latter's brother-in-law Samuel Fulton Neill, were arrested for the possession of four shotguns. Neill's car was one of those allegedly used in the Buskhill attack. He was later shot dead in Portadown on 25 January 1976, allegedly by Jackson for having informed the RUC about Thomas Crozier's participation in the attack. The panel stated that it was unclear why Crozier, Jackson, and Neill were not in police custody at the time the Miami Showband killings took place. Martin Dillon maintained in The Dirty War that the Miami Showband attack was planned weeks before at a house in Portadown, and the person in charge of the overall operation was a former UDR man, whom Dillon referred to for legal reasons as [...] "Mr. A". Dillon also opined in God and the Gun: the Church and Irish <b>Terrorism</b> <b>that</b> the dead bombers, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, had actually led the UVF gang at Buskhill. Journalists Kevin Dowling and Liam Collins in the Irish Independent however, suggested in their respective articles that Jackson had been the leader of the unit.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, {{while being}} interviewed about an {{anthology}} of the independence movement on radio Juan Mari Brás made a public request to Ojeda Ríos to detail the EPB's ideology for that project. The requested information was received shortly afterwards and published in Claridad. The article begins by quoting Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth [...] "the colonized are cured of colonial neurosis by driving the colonist out by force", citing the ambient of the populace after the destruction of airplanes in Muñiz airbase {{as an example of}} this, remembering a general feeling of [...] "pride and hope" [...] in the populace. Ojeda Ríos then establishes a dichotomy between the reactionary violence of colonialism and revolutionary actions, saying that the first was imposed on Puerto Ricans and created divisions that could potentially lead to a Civil War. He then discussed that the EPB believes that the right for self-determination and independence established in Resolution 1514 (XV) grants [...] "moral and legal strength" [...] to their actions. Ojeda Ríos further cites the provisions of Resolution 2105 (XX) inviting UN members to cooperate with armed resistance in colonies, the assessment provided in Resolution 2326 that repression of armed movements is [...] "incompatible with the parameters of Resolution 1514" [...] and Resolution 2621 (XXV) that declares ongoing colonialism a crime [...] "against the principles of international law" [...] as supporting his stance. He concludes by stating that the violence employed by the EPB [...] "is not aggressive, but defensive". Ojeda Ríos also quoted Fanon's assertion that the [...] "colonist makes history", noting the existence of two coexisting and conflicting accounts of Puerto Rican history and establishing a parallel with the revolutionary history in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular by mentioning the involvement of Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María Mercedes in Simon Bolivar's campaign. He cites the 1811 San Germán conspiracy, an independentist uprising planned by members of the Regimiento de Granada Andrés Salvador and Juan Vizcarrondo Ortiz de Zárate in 1838 and the actions of bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi and politician Ramón Power y Giralt as events that build the Cry of Lares and as part of an [...] "ignored history". Ojeda also established a contrast between Betances and Luis Muñoz Rivera, calling the latter an [...] "opportunist" [...] that promoted a reform of the Spanish colonial system, calling Albizu the spiritual successor of the former for his criticism of autonomists that pursue an expansion of faculties under the territorial clause. He calls Corretjer the next link in the chain and laments that the initiatives of independentists that were part of the Muñoz Marín administration were attributed to the governor [...] "for the benefit of the North American government". Ojeda Ríos reiterated his posture against participating in general elections and rebutted an argument recently published where countries like Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and Chile were essentially neocolonies, citing that they merely responded to their historical realities and were still capable to employ these alliances according to their own interests despite the influence of the United States. Ojeda Ríos concluded noting that EPB members held civilian jobs and acted covertly, resulting in the presence of Macheteros in any place and any government agency, noting that at the moment their strategy was not one of frontal assault but of armed propaganda, through which actions were focused on targets that could gather the attention and support of the public. He insisted that this was resulting in a covert support that would allow a progression towards other strategies, while avoiding actions against them. Ojeda Ríos closed this letter by contrasting the actions of the EPB to terrorist tactics, citing the ongoing war in the Middle East, the Holocaust and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as examples of an unacceptable <b>terrorism</b> <b>that</b> had [...] "no space" [...] within the organization's philosophy. One that he described as based on the principles of [...] "equality" [...] and [...] "social justice".|$|E
