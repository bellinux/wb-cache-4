5|$|The local Red Cross {{offices in}} Port Vila and Luganville {{prepared}} general relief supplies before the storm's arrival, including tents, <b>tool</b> <b>kits,</b> and first aid units. By {{four days after}} the cyclone's passage, the main wharf in Port Vila was re-opened and the two sunken boats were removed. Additionally, the evacuees were allowed to return to their homes, and communications between the various islands were restored. The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets. By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000household relief packages were distributed. The Vanuatu government allocated VT25million (2004VUV, $236,000 2004USD) for the affected citizens. Overall, the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens. On Tanna island, the cyclone's passage produced a malaria outbreak.|$|E

40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at [URL] {{software}} interface between the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> Environment is introduced. This research {{is based on the}} need for validating model performance and visualizing simultaneous multiple-spacecraft proximity maneuvers for emerging missions. It is common for spacecraft systems to be modeled with MATLAB and Simulink. Furthermore, the software package Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> is often used for animating and evaluating spacecraft maneuvers. In this research, a MATLAB/Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> interface was developed to propagate six-degree-of-freedom spacecraft models, compared against Satellite-Tool-Kit-generated ephemeris, and animated for analysis. MATLAB script with necessary formatting is used for Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> initialization and animation. The MATLAB/Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> simulation interface allows variations in number, shape, and dimensions of spacecraft. Additionally, numerous model and simulation parameters can be selected and synchronized between MATLAB and Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit.</b> Furthermore, either predetermined, or randomly distributed, initial spacecraft positions and orientations are permitted by the interface.
