2500|$|A carpet is a <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> {{typically}} {{consisting of}} an upper layer of pile {{attached to a}} backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but, since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, nylon or polyester are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts which are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term [...] "carpet" [...] is often used interchangeably with the term [...] "rug", although the term [...] "carpet" [...] {{can be applied to}} a floor covering that covers an entire house, whereas a [...] "rug" [...] is generally no bigger than a single room, and traditionally does not even span from one wall to another, and is typically not even attached as part of the floor.|$|E
40|$|As part of {{environmental}} management policies in Europe, separate collection of organic household waste and nonorganic household waste {{has become increasingly}} common. As waste is often stored indoors, this policy might increase microbial exposure in the home environment. In this study we evaluated the association between indoor storage of organic waste and levels of microbial agents in house dust. The levels of bacterial endotoxins, mold Î²(1 â†’ 3) -glucans, and fungal extracullar polysaccharides (EPS) of Aspergillus and Penicillium species were determined in house dust extracts as markers of microbial exposure. House dust samples were collected in 99 homes in The Netherlands {{selected on the basis}} of whether separated organic waste was present in the house. In homes in which separated organic waste was stored indoors for 1 week or more the levels of endotoxin, EPS, and glucan were 3. 2 -, 7. 6 -, and 4. 6 -fold higher, respectively (all P 0. 2). The presence of <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> was another major determinant of microbial levels (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Our results indicate that increased microbial contaminant levels in homes are associated with indoor storage of separated organic waste. These increased levels might increase the risk of bioaerosol-related respiratory symptoms in susceptible people...|$|E

40|$|The organic {{emissions}} from <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> were studied {{in a test}} chamber (1 m" 3) at 23 C, 45 % r. H. and an air exchange rate of 1 h"-" 1. The gaseous compounds were collected on Tenax. They were analyzed by thermodesorption coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Eight <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> (four with <b>textile</b> backing and four with styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) foam backing) were investigated. The time dependence of the emissions of eleven dominating organic compounds (toluene, m/p-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -methylideneheptane, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6 -Pentamethyl- 3 -hepten, 4 -Phenylcyclohexene, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane and limonene) was determined. The decrease of the concentration with time reflects the volatility of the compounds. The concentration of the volatile compounds such as toluene, m/p-xylene, ethylbenzene and styrene decreases within 24 h by more than 90 %, while the concentration of the less volatile compounds, such as 4 -Phenylcyclohexene, decreases within 100 h by only 50 - 70 %. Particularly high concentrations of the dodecene, 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -methylideneheptane {{are found in the}} {{emissions from}} carpets from German manufacturers reaching a maximum concentration of 3. 1 mg/m" 3 in one case 4.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} human's exposure to permethrin from treated woollen <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> and possible adverse health effects, a study {{was carried out}} in 80 private homes in Hannover (Germany) equipped with woollen <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> (wool wall-to-wall carpets or woven or knotted rugs). For indoor monitoring, permethrin was determined both in house dust and on suspended particles. While permethrin concentrations in house dust (< 2 mm) were high (arithmetic mean: 53. 7 mg/kg, 90 th percentile 129. 1 mg/kg), the permethrin concentrations in the air (suspended particles) were very low (arithmetic mean 2. 8 ng/m 3, 90 th percentile 5. 8 ng/m 3, first sampling). Additional experiments demonstrate that permethrin on suspended particles result from carpet fiber abrasion (and not from an evaporation/re-condensation process). The internal exposure of the 145 inhabitants participating in the study was determined by biological monitoring (permethrin metabolites in urine). In a first sampling period almost 14 % of the samples showed concentrations of the metabolite DCCA and almost 23 % of the metabolite 3 -PBA above the limit of detection (0. 2 microgram/l). A model was developed which allows the calculation of the metabolite concentration in urine due to inhalative uptake of permethrin. Even for the worst case situation the calculated metabolite concentrations were ca. 30 times lower than the experimental results. The observed concentrations of metabolites are comparable to those of the background concentrations of the general population in Germany, suggesting that they must origin from other sources than woollen <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> The indoor and biological monitoring data as well as the evaluation of the reported symptoms give no indication of an adverse health effect due to carpet treatment by permethrin...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the indoor exposure to permethrin, in rooms containing wool <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> In 80 private homes with wool rugs and wool wall-to-wall carpets, the concentration of permethrin was monitored in wool fibres, in house dust and on airborne particles. The concentrations of permethrin in wool fibres varied from < 1 to 245 mg permethrin/kg wool fibre. The permethrin concentrations in house dust ranged from < 1 to 659 mg/kg. Permethrin was found in very low concentrations on airborne particles. Independent on the permethrin concen trations in house dust, in most cases the concentrations varied between < 1 and 6 ng/m 3.

40|$|There {{are many}} sources which may {{contribute}} to the contamination of indoor air, especially by organic compounds. Emissions from building materials are of particular importance. As these different materials often emit, at least in part, the same compounds, the sources of indoor air pollution cannot be identified unequivocally by field studies. Test chamber studies of building materials have been employed for source identification. Climate chambers used for measuring formaldehyde released from particle-board are now manufactured commercially and will be standardized in the near future. These chambers are, however, not suited for measuring so-called "volatile organic compounds" (VOC). We have set up two types of climate chambers, the performance of which has been tested extensively.

In a second group of 19 patients who refused chemical intervention, the clinical effects of application of allergen-impermeable mattress encasings were studied. In all three treatment groups, Der p 1 levels in mattress dust were statistically significantly decreased after 12 months. However, this decrease was much greater in the group who received mattress encasings (final mean level 430 ng/g) than in groups with acaricide-or placebo-treated mattresses (final mean levels 1730 and 2100 ng/g, respectively).

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of appearance parameters {{is critical for}} quality assurance purposes when determining lifetime and/or beauty of textile products. Practical evaluations of appearance are often performed by human visual inspection, which is repetitive, exhausting, unreliable and costly. Thus, computerized automatic visual inspection {{has been used to}} alleviate those problems. Several papers have proposed objective mechanisms for quality inspection mostly using texture analysis approaches which are often not robust enough. One of the main issues for robustness of texture analysis approaches is the capability of distinguishing between similar textures. In this paper, we review, select and evaluate texture analysis approaches for distinguishing fine changes of global texture in degradation of <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> As a result, we found that the power spectrum, local binary patterns, the texture spectrum, Gaussian Markov random fields, autoregressive models and the pseudo-Wigner distribution provide good descriptors for measuring fine changes of global texture.

40|$|The time {{course of}} {{isocyanate}} emission from curing polyurethane (PUR) resins and adhesives was studied {{in two different}} emission test chambers. The measured emissions were strongly dependent {{on the type of}} experiment. The adhesives under investigation contained different types of diisocyanates and are used for different applications, e. g. for fixing of <b>textile</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> The influence of the curing mechanism on emission was studied by comparing the emission curves of one-component adhesives (OCA) and two-component adhesives (TCA). For TCA, the decrease in isocyanate emission was found to follow at two-step process during curing. In the first step, the emission is dominated by surface evaporation, and the decay of emission is mainly caused by the decrease in monomer content due to reaction. In the second step, the release is limited by intenal diffusion. The influence of monomer reactivity on the emission profile could be demonstrated for 2, 4 '- and 4, 4 '-MDI. The less-reactive 2, 4 '-MDI caused prolonged emission. A strong dependence of emission rates on temperature and adhesive viscosity was also obvious. The evaluation of emission rates of different commercially available PUR adhesives showed the highest emission from systems that are applied at high temperatures. The high reactivity of diisocyanates requires special techniques for sampling and analysis. Therefore, an analytical method using HPLC-MS/MS was developed that enables limites of quantiatation of < 5 ng/m 3 with a sampling volume of 1001...|$|R

Two questionnaires were developed to obtain the data. One questionnaire was designed to elicit public opinion regarding carpeting in general and its use in specific locations. A second questionnaire was developed to gather information about environmental changes that may have been observed or experienced by people working in carpeted offices. The sample for Questionnaire # 1 included 100 people who visited a suite of offices which were carpeted for this experiment. Questionnaire # 2 involved 32 college employees who had worked in both carpeted and uncarpeted offices. Two laboratory tests were conducted to determine the projected performance of selected characteristics of the test carpeting. Samples were tested for color fastness to light and pile recovery. The results of this study indicated that people liked and approved of the use of carpeting in public buildings in specific locations. These included general offices and school administration offices.

40|$|In March 2002, the Swedish Work Environment Authority {{performed}} an inspection at Skottsundsbackens home for elderly in the municipality of Sundsvall. The Swedish Work Environment Authority {{came to the}} conclusion that the ergonomic problems many employees had experienced were related to the <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> in the building. The municipality lodged an appeal, but in October 2005 the appeal was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden. In the decision you can read that “The Swedish Work Environment Authority points out that if the <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> has got a suitable springiness or not can not be objectively judged, since there are no test methods for this”. In spite of this, the Swedish Work Environment Authority believes that the best way to minimise the risks of strain injuries is to replace the current <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> with a softer <b>floor</b> <b>covering.</b> Since there are existing test methods to quantify properties of springiness (i. e. shock absorption and vertical deformation) for sport surfaces, the aim of this study has been to find out whether these methods can be applied to ordinary <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> If it’s possible, this might be a way of objectively judge if a <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> is suitable or not for a certain work activity. The test methods chosen were EN 14808 Surfaces for sports areas – Determination of shock absorption and EN 14809 Surfaces for sport areas – Determination of vertical deformation.
