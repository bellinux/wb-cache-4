2500|$|In presidential elections, the 3rd District {{is rather}} competitive.

He argued that Obama [...] "had to distance himself far from Wright. Instead, he was brave." [...] Susan B. Hansen of the University of Pittsburgh noted that [...] "the dilemma for Obama is that the more he talks about race being unimportant or transcended, the more important it will become to the media and voters' perceptions." [...] She suggested Obama did not put the Wright issue to rest and that, if Obama became the nominee, Wright's comments would no doubt {{play a role in the}} general election as fodder for Republican attacks against him. Similarly, Eric Plutzer of Penn State argued that Obama's speech [...] "did not put the Rev. Wright controversy behind him.
