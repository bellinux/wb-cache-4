5|$|The diet of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and mantis shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark {{is also known}} to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
50|$|Phantasmidine is a nicotinic agonist {{that acts}} at {{acetylcholine}} receptors. It mimics {{the effects of}} acetylcholine on <b>the</b> body’s neuronal-based <b>nervous</b> systems (both <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> system CNS and <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> system PNS) and <b>the</b> muscle-based <b>nervous</b> system (<b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{sympathetic}} <b>nervous</b> system (SNS) {{is one of}} {{the three}} main divisions of <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system, <b>the</b> others being <b>the</b> parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system (PSNS) and <b>the</b> enteric <b>nervous</b> system (ENS). <b>The</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system functions to regulate the body's unconscious actions. <b>The</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system's primary process is to stimulate the body's fight-or-flight response. It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis. <b>The</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system is described as being complementary to <b>the</b> parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system which stimulates the body to [...] "feed and breed" [...] and to (then) [...] "rest-and-digest".|$|R
50|$|The PNS can {{be divided}} into the {{autonomic}} and somatic <b>nervous</b> system. <b>The</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system {{can be divided}} into the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and enteric <b>nervous</b> system. <b>The</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system regulates <b>the</b> “fight or flight” responses. <b>The</b> parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system regulates <b>the</b> “rest and digest” responses. <b>The</b> enteric <b>nervous</b> system innervates <b>the</b> viscera (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gall bladder). <b>The</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system consists of peripheral nerve fibers that send sensory information to <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> system and motor nerve fibers that project to skeletal muscle. <b>The</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system engages in voluntary reactions, and <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system engages in involuntary reactions.|$|R
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of <b>the</b> <b>Nervous</b> System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system during 1938. Neuroscience {{during the twentieth century}} began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|In all platyhelminths, <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> {{system is}} {{concentrated}} {{at the head}} end. This is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather like those of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia {{in the head and}} main nerve trunks running along their bodies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> earthworm's <b>nervous</b> {{system has}} three parts: <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS), {{peripheral}} <b>nervous</b> system and <b>the</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{peripheral}} <b>nervous</b> {{system is}} divided into <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system, and <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system. <b>The</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system is under voluntary control, and transmits signals from the brain to end organs such as muscles. <b>The</b> sensory <b>nervous</b> system is part of <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system and transmits signals from senses such as taste and touch (including fine touch and gross touch) to the spinal cord and brain. <b>The</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system is a 'self-regulating' system which influences the function of organs outside of voluntary control, such as the heart rate, or {{the functions of the}} digestive system.|$|R

5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|Physiology is {{the study}} the {{interaction}} of how, for example, <b>the</b> <b>nervous,</b> immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such medically oriented disciplines as neurology and immunology.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{peripheral}} <b>nervous</b> system (PNS) {{is divided}} into <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system, <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system, and <b>the</b> enteric <b>nervous</b> system.

5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system.

The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone.|$|E
5|$|The most {{universal}} {{features of}} the body structure of molluscs are a mantle with a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion, {{and the organization of}} <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system. Many have a calcareous shell.|$|E

50|$|Acetylcholine has {{functions}} both in <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> system (PNS) and in <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS). In <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> system, acetylcholine activates muscles, {{and is a}} major neurotransmitter in <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> system. In <b>the</b> CNS, cholinergic projections {{from the}} basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus support the cognitive functions of those target areas.|$|R
25|$|While {{their cell}} bodies {{are found in}} <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS), α motor neurons are also {{considered}} part of <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> system—a branch of <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> system (PNS)—because their axons extend into the periphery to innervate skeletal muscles.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nervous</b> {{system in}} beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Racz {{has also}} {{conducted}} research and co-authored articles with other experts in pain management to improve {{diagnosis and treatment}} of complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS), a long-term disorder of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system which is a challenging pain problem that is often misunderstood and misdiagnosed.|$|E
5000|$|A parasympatholytic {{agent is}} a {{substance}} or activity {{that reduces the}} activity of <b>the</b> parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system.

5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.

5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage.
