Assuming that differences between the Proportionate consolidation and the Equity method on the financial statement of the venturer mainly refer to the <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>total</b> <b>liabilities,</b> total revenues and total expenses, without changes in terms of equity and net income, we formulate some starting assumptions. Considering the previous literature and the assumptions above, the current study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring the following main research question: which is the market reaction on price/earnings deriving from the two different accounting treatments? To provide first results, we are going to measure accounting comparability through Herfindhal index related to the differing accounting choices for the consolidation of interests in joint controlled entities (JCEs), hence we conduct a descriptive analysis, whose aim is to describe the distribution of the 21 Italian groups, each years from 2004 to 2010 based on two parameters, Price/Earnings and method of consolidation for JCE’s, with the purpose to verify if the market is able to capture the above mentioned lack of comparability deriving from a multiple accounting option...|$|E

The financial return is a basic indicator which characterizes the business performances that is found directly under the trade policy (trade cost), efficiency of capital employed (economic profitability) but also under the financial policy of the company. If the economic {{rate of return}} expresses a remuneration of the employed capital only in relation to operating activities, the financial rate of return quantifies a remuneration of the private capital trough all three types of activity: operational, financial and extraordinary. Starting from the consideration that the financial rate of return expresses the efficiency of equity or permanent capital use of the company we can state that it is of particular importance to the shareholders of the company, which considers according to it’s level whether their investments are justified and they will continue to support the business development through raising of fresh capital or abandonment for a limited period to one part of the dividends due.

This study also assesses the noise theory and explains why Malaysia REIT trade at NAV premium and NAV discount. Annual data series for annual closing price of the thirteen listed real estate investment trusts (ARREIT, AXREIT, TWREIT, AMFIRST, BSDREIT, AHP, AHP 2, ALAQAR, HEKTAR, UOAREIT, QCAPITAL, ATRIUM and STAREIT) are obtained from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, also called Bursa Malaysia for the study period from 2005 to 2010. Information about <b>total</b> <b>asset,</b> <b>total</b> <b>liabilities</b> and number of shares outstanding are getting from the 13 MREIT’s respective annual financial report. The result showed that AHP 2 has the lowest NAV value among the thirteen listed REIT in Malaysia and traded at NAV discount. This was compatible with the NAV discount in NAV approach. NAV discounts below the current stock prices are reflection of poor current and future prospects for firm earnings, mistakes in financing and operations decision. AXREIT is traded at NAV discount due to the irrational behaviour of investors in noise trader theory and not because it’s poor performance. Investors are overly optimistic about AXREIT according to noise theory. Overall, MREIT are traded at NAV premium. In conclusion, MREIT are generally much better companies in terms of disclosure, transparency, share liquidity, corporate democracy and depth of managemen...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an econometric investigation into financial markets and portfolio choice {{over the period}} 1955 - 56 to 1968 - 69. The theoretical framework adopted for the investigation draws heavily from the literature on portfolio choice surveyed in chapter 2, and in particular, from the monetary articles of James Tobin. The portfolios selected by the trading banks, the non-banking financial institutions and the non-financial private sector are successfully explained by variables representing real expected asset yields {{and the degree of}} credit rationing in the market for trading bank advances. A key variable influencing behaviour was found to be Tobin's supply price of capital, defined as that rate of return the community of wealth owners requires in order to absorb the existing stock of capital into its portfolio. Deviations of the supply price of capital from the marginal productivity of capital were found to stimulate the sort of responses expected from Tobin's articles. The many time series constructed and drawn together for this investigation are described in appendix A. Chapter 3 analyses trends in the portfolios of the three groups listed above. Theoretical considerations, data limitations and institutional details are combined in chapter 4 to produce a macroeconomic model comprising 60 equations including 27 identities. The equations of principal interest in the model are estimated by two stage least squares as described in chapter 5. Because not all equations were estimated the overall specification and properties of the model cannot be comprehensively evaluated.

40|$|It {{has always}} been a major {{priority}} for policy makers to know whether national debts are fiscally sustainable. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of public government debt levels (debt as a share of GDP) on per-capita GDP growth in the ten Canadian provinces. Using panel data from 1989 to 2008 and the standard two-stage least squares approach (IV/ 2 SLS) as well as GMM estimation, the study concludes that public debt is inversely related to the growth rate of GDP per capita. Consistent with other existing studies, this paper also shows evidence that debt levels are nonlinearly associated to economic growth with a debt turning point estimated to be around 40 % of GDP on average. This threshold may seem small compared to an average of 80 - 90 % that has been reported in previous studies but it would be both irrelevant and misleading to make such a comparison. This is because the analysis in this paper is based on net financial debt (the difference between <b>total</b> financial <b>assets</b> and <b>total</b> <b>liabilities)</b> and not gross debt. Therefore, given how significant the gap between gross debt and net debt can be, the debt turning point estimated in this study is not small per se.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} those financial and nonfinancial measures used by small, independent, four year liberal arts colleges to assess their financial condition and the importance placed on these specific indicators. ^ Through review of the body of literature which addresses financial health indices and attendance at seminars and meetings demonstrating how to define and determine financial stress, a listing of frequently identified indicators was developed. The final design of the survey instrument was edited after consultation with experienced colleagues and other informed sources. This questionnaire elicits the maintenance and perceived importance of selected admissions, student enrollment, faculty, and institutional and departmental operating and performance data. The chief business officers of the sample population (193 colleges) were mailed the questionnaire. Seventy-six usable returns were the basis for the study 2 ̆ 7 s descriptive and evaluative discussion of institutional application of the statistics. ^ Analysis of the responses indicates that institutional performance measures are retained most frequently on the transactional level and their use diminishes with the need for integration of additional data, calculation of interdepartmental statistics or increased levels of aggregation. Availability and value may be ranked in the following hierarchical order: ADMISSIONS (recruitment flow process and yield rates), BASIC REGISTRATION (headcount by level and major, FTE 2 ̆ 7 s by level, retention, and student credit hour consumption), FACULTY (headcount, FTE 2 ̆ 7 s credit hours generated by discipline, and percent tenured), STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIOS, and ELEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (expenditure distribution, comparisons of operating revenues to expenses and <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> to <b>total</b> <b>liabilities).</b> The use of standard enrollment units, such as FTE 2 ̆ 7 s or per student credit hour, is rated low.

Only student credit hours appear to be maintained consistently on both discipline and institutional level. The least available statistics are those relating to the analysis of the college 2 ̆ 7 s financial structure: instructional costs, fixed costs, and ratios among income and expenditure components. The more important determinants of costs (average number of students per course section, faculty load, and compensation by discipline) have a low perceived value as a health indicator. ^ This study reveals that the need still exists to incorporate valid and credible measures of quantitative as well as qualitative outcomes of institutional activities to determine the real cost of the achievement of both academic and societal goals and mission fulfillment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{healthcare}} literature sometimes cites Medicare as {{a negative}} determinant of hospital profitability. However, a review of Florida acute care short-term general hospital data revealed a subset of profitable hospitals with high percentages of their revenue structure comprised of Medicare reimbursements. Some investigators might contend that these hospitals are just better managed; that hospital profitability {{is not related to}} patient mix or payer source. Although good management enhances financial health, there are perhaps other reasons why certain hospitals can become profitable with Medicare as their primary revenue source. Research findings indicate there is wide geographic variability shown for per-capita volumes of discretionary procedures reimbursed by Medicare, and broad variations in Medicare spending per enrollee for general acute care short-term hospitalizations. It was also found that many of the hospitals performing higher rates of discretionary procedures and showing the ability to make a profit with Medicare are investor owned. The focus of this study, covering years 2000 - 2005, was to examine two strategies using discretionary procedures under Medicare that Florida investor owned hospitals may employ to increase profitability and maintain long-term financial health. Part 1 of the study examined the association between long-term financial viability, measured by the <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> divided by <b>total</b> <b>liabilities</b> (TATL) ratio (the reciprocal of the debt ratio) and percentages per hospital of two discretionary cardiac and orthopedic procedure variables, reimbursed by conventional Medicare. A positive association was found between the TATL ratio and these variables, as well as significant marginal effects in the association between the TATL ratio and interaction terms for hospital ownership (where investor owned = 1 and not-for-profit = 0) and the discretionary cardiac procedure variable and ownership and the discretionary orthopedic procedure variable. Part 2 used total charges as the dependent variable for patient discharges reimbursed by Medicare HMO. It was found that investor owned hospitals generally assess significantly higher charges than not-for-profits for discretionary CABG and valve replacement procedures for patients with equivalent levels of medical services and hospitalization. It was also found that charges significantly increase for both investor-owned and not-for-profit hospitals located in the southern region of Florida...|$|R
40|$|Capital {{maintenance}} rules {{are part of}} a legal capital regime that consists of rules on raising capital and rules on maintaining it. The function of these rules is the protection of the corporation’s creditors. This is evidenced by the fact that in public as well as private companies the provisions on legal capital are not open to disapplication or variation even with unanimous shareholder consent. Thus, providing the company with a minimum of funding and ensuring equal treatment of shareholders are mere reflexes of creditor protection or, at best, ancillary purposes of legal capital. Legal capital is part of a corporation’s equity. The key feature of equity is that it ranks behind the claims of other stakeholders in the distribution of a corporation’s assets. Consequently, equity will also be the first part of a corporation’s funds to be depleted by losses. Capital {{maintenance rules}} seek to enforce this order of priority of different groups of stakeholders by restricting distributions to shareholders. Such restrictions are not unique to legal systems that have adopted a legal capital regime. A prominent example of a statute that has eliminated mandatory legal capital is the Delaware General Corporation Law. § 154 DCGL leaves it up to the directors to decide whether any part of the consideration received by the corporation for its shares shall be attributed to capital. Thus, a Delaware corporation need not have any stated capital. This has significant impact on the funds available for distribution to shareholders. Pursuant to § 170 (a) DGCL dividends may only be paid out of surplus or, in the absence of surplus, out of net profits of the current or the preceding fiscal year. § 154 DGCL defines surplus as the excess of a corporation’s net assets over the amount of its capital, and net assets as the amount by which <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> exceed <b>total</b> <b>liabilities.</b> A corporation without stated capital may, therefore, distribute all of its net assets to its shareholders and continue business without any equity on its balance sheet. This highlights the difference between the different approaches to creditor protection in Germany and the U. S. Both legal systems acknowledge the priority of creditors over shareholders in corporate distributions. However, German law seeks to give creditors additional comfort by requiring companies to raise and maintain additional layers of assets above and beyond those corresponding to the company’s liabilities that may not be depleted by way of distributions to shareholders. While private companies must merely raise and maintain their stated capital, public companies are required to raise and maintain additional equity accounts unavailable for distributions to shareholders such as the share premium account 1 and the legal reserve. 2 In recent years a number of objections have been raised against this concept of creditor protection. Critics argue that contractual arrangements are a more efficient means for protecting the interests of creditors. 3 Capital maintenance does not prevent creditors from negotiating for more stringent protection of their claims such as collateral or financial covenants. It does, however, provide a minimum standard of protection for the benefit of creditors who lack the commercial experience or the bargaining power or who, like tort victims, are simply unable to negotiate for contractual safeguards. Capital maintenance ensures that their protection against excessive distributions does not depend on large creditors who are free to waive covenants that, in effect, benefit all creditors in exchange for individual arrangements that work exclusively in their favour...|$|R

In this context, the rates of <b>total</b> debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset,</b> <b>total</b> current debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset,</b> <b>total</b> long debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset</b> and <b>total</b> debt to total equity are distinguished as the measures of capital structure. The data used in this study consisted of a sample of 133 companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2012. To analyze the data and to perform hypothesis tests, a linear regression model, based on combinatorial methods or data panel, and also a nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis have been applied. The results of the research hypothesis tests based on regression analysis revealed an insignificant relationship between capital structure and economic value added. Furthermore, the results showed that, there was an inverse moderate relationship between rate of <b>total</b> debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset</b> and <b>total</b> current debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset</b> with economic value added. There is an inverse weak relationship between rate of total long debt to <b>total</b> <b>asset</b> and <b>total</b> debt to total equity with economic value added...|$|R
