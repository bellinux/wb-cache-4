To <b>this</b> <b>end</b> Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him glide. His mental stability ultimately deteriorated after he was called before HUAC, leading to him being forcibly brought to a mental asylum.|$|E
5|$|A new weir {{wall was}} {{constructed}} between 1992 and 2000 due to safety concerns {{with the original}} wall. Construction was planned to limit negative affects on scenery and wildlife. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> natural stones {{were used for the}} exterior and fishways were included in the design.|$|E

5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>ending</b> was the {{original}} canon ending of the game before the release of Dead Rising 2: Case West, although in E3 2013, the developers confirmed <b>this</b> <b>ending</b> as canon, so {{it is possible that}} TK zombifies after the fall, and the rest plays out like Ending A, thus making <b>this</b> <b>ending</b> possibly canon with Case West.|$|R

5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
5|$|As of May 2015, {{the federal}} {{government}} in conjunction with UNSOM was working toward establishing a comprehensive, international standards and obligations-compliant ammunition and weapons management system.

The secondary objectives are environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and flora, and environmental monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Bad Ending: Do {{not fight}} Neron but instead choose {{to finish the}} Final Sealing. In <b>this</b> <b>ending</b> there is no boss battle because Darwin is {{immediately}} warped to the Pedestal of the Final Sealing and brainwashed into obeying the orders of The Creator. <b>This</b> <b>ending</b> also reveals that the Four Horsemen are The Creator's minions; this is elaborated on {{in the next two}} endings. If the player has already achieved the two good endings, the events of this one will make more sense. If the player wants to avoid the tricky boss battles required to get the two good endings, they can just get <b>this</b> <b>ending.</b> <b>This</b> <b>ending</b> leads to a Game Over.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops {{to be used to}} <b>this</b> <b>end</b> in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to <b>this</b> <b>end.</b> After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, in {{the lead}} up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a {{requirement}} to increase capacity on for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of redundant second-hand USSLRV vehicles from the Muni Metro system in San Francisco. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> two were procured for testing and shipped to the UK, with one taken to Metrolink's Queen's Road depot. In the end, the proposal was not taken forward as the vehicles {{were found to be}} unsuitable for use in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his military ambitions, Himmler established {{the beginnings of a}} parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> administrator Oswald Pohl set up the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses. Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters of money and business.|$|E

He testified before Congress in support of this cause, and met with President George W. Bush at the White House.|$|E

These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them {{to power the}} artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to <b>this</b> <b>end.</b> The game ends with {{the destruction of a}} large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations.|$|E

Ehrlichman was the one who had initially hired Caulfield in 1969; Ehrlichman intended for Caulfield to conduct private investigation while undercover as a private sector employee, it was Caulfield who insisted on working from the White House. Caulfield's work to <b>this</b> <b>end</b> had already resulted in two wiretaps on phone lines—one on Nixon's brother Donald, and another on journalist Joseph Kraft.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{government}} {{was eager to}} control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To <b>this</b> <b>end</b> it emphasised various social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. Under Kenyatta, Kenya's first university—the University of Nairobi—was established, with several others following after.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.
