5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel. Regarding the composition of the song, Williams stated, [...] "It is a song that came from Africa {{more than a hundred years}} ago. I don't think anyone knows who wrote it or who started singing that chorus. When the song leaked last week, so many people from Africa and Nigeria were trying <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> where it came from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 631, Emperor Taizong was set {{to build}} palaces at Luoyang. [...] Dai spoke against it, {{reasoning}} that the people were too worn out by the wars {{to be ready for}} large construction projects. [...] Emperor Taizong praised and rewarded him, stating, [...] "Dai Zhou is not a relative to me, but he is faithful and capable. [...] He is also considerate of the state, and where there is something important, he did not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know.</b> [...] The offices and titles he received are but tokens of my thanks to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{maximize}} the output from their holdings, the Bradleys lease their lands during hunting season. Minnie Lou has issued ten suggestions to her temporary tenants. One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so I like to have hunters call {{ahead of time and}} let me know when they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{personal}} {{loss was}} immediately followed, on 15 May, by {{the resignation of}} Admiral Fisher after continuing disagreements with Churchill and in frustration at the disappointing developments in Gallipoli. Aged 74, Fisher's behaviour had grown increasingly erratic and, in frequent letters to Lloyd George, he gave vent to his frustrations with the First Lord of the Admiralty; [...] "Fisher writes to me every day or two <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> how things are going. He {{has a great deal}} of trouble with his chief, who is always wanting to do something big and striking." [...] Adverse events, press hostility, Tory opposition and personal sorrows assailed Asquith, and his position was further weakened by his Liberal colleagues. Cassar considers that Lloyd George displayed a distinct lack of loyalty, and Koss writes of the contemporary rumours that Churchill had [...] "been up to his old game of intriguing all round" [...] and reports a claim that Churchill [...] "unquestionably inspired" [...] the Repington Letter, in collusion with Sir John French. Lacking cohesion internally, and attacked from without, Asquith determined that his government could not continue and he wrote to the King, [...] "I have come decidedly to the conclusion that the [...] must be reconstituted on a broad and non-party basis." ...|$|E

2500|$|Only 16 {{editions of}} The United Irishman had been {{produced}} when Mitchel was arrested, {{and the paper}} suppressed. Mitchel concluded his last article in The United Irishman, from Newgate prison, entitled [...] "A Letter to Farmers", [...] "For me, I abide my fate joyfully; for I know that whatever betide me, my work is nearly done. Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle. As I sit here, and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men—my gallant Confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended bow, waiting till the time comes. They have marched past my prison windows <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it.
