5|$|After a full {{pre-season}} {{he started}} to play well and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate. Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but {{that he would make}} an exception for Manchester United.|$|E

He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan {{opened up a}} four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained his advantage to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> intention of retiring.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> bruising was seen as evidence {{that he had not}} blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E

5|$|Hibs {{enjoyed a}} good season in 2000–01 as they {{finished}} third in the league and reached the 2001 Scottish Cup Final, which was lost 3–0 to Celtic. Manager Alex McLeish departed for Rangers in December 2001; team captain Franck Sauzée was appointed as the new manager, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> previous coaching experience. A terrible run of form followed and Sauzée was fired after being in charge for 69 days.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, {{it soon became}} clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E

Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of either case. DNA analysis led to the arrest and conviction of William E. Cosden for Devine's murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country (a {{territory}} that was claimed by {{several of the}} British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to tell the French to leave.

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
