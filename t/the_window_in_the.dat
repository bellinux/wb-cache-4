5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E

Several other stained glass windows date from the Victorian era. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower was donated by a London goldsmith named Mattheson to commemorate the rebuilding {{of the church in}} 1863.

5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E

25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century.

The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess.

The church has a [...] "roughly dressed" [...] font with nine sides, dating from the 14th or 15th century.

500|$|The {{window on}} the north wall of the nave is {{to the east of}} the door, and was added in the 19th century.

Inside, there is no internal structural division between the nave and the chancel apart from a single step. There are four windows, all with clear leaded glass: the east window is the oldest, dating from the 14th century.

500|$|... "Bart the Mother" [...] was {{the last}} {{full-length}} episode David X. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen teamed up with The Simpsons creator Matt Groening to develop Futurama, where he served as executive producer and head writer for the series' entire run. Cohen's idea for the episode {{started out as a}} B story for Homer. In the original concept, pigeons nest outside Homer's window at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Burns exterminates the pigeons and Homer climbs out onto the ledge of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a blizzard, to nest the eggs. Cohen said the idea [...] " [...] fit in anywhere", so he decided to pitch it as an A story instead, with Bart nesting the eggs instead of Homer. The Simpsons writer George Meyer thought the idea of Bart shooting the bird and simply nesting the eggs was too straightforward, and he did not think it had [...] "enough of a twist" [...] to be a good episode. Cohen and Meyer eventually decided the eggs should be lizard eggs. Cohen thought the twist was what ultimately made the episode both [...] "touching" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
