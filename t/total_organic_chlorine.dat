Twelve organic chlorine species and five organic bromine species were measured from 12 samples collected near the tropopause between 23. 8 deg N and 25. 3 deg N during AASE 2. The average mixing ratios of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> and total organic bromine were 3. 50 +/- 0. 06 ppbv and 21. 1 +/- 0. 8 pptv, respectively. CH 3 Cl represented 15. 1 % of the <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine,</b> with CFC 11 (CCl 3 F) and CFC 12 (CCl 2 F 2) accounting for 22. 6 % and 28. 2 %, respectively, with the remaining 34. 1 % primarily from CCl 4, CH 3 CCl 3, and CFC 113 (CCl 2 FCClF 2). CH 3 Br represented 54 % of the total organic bromine. The 95 % confidence intervals of the mixing ratios of all but four of the individual compounds were within the range observed in low and mid-latitude midtroposphere samples. The four compounds with significantly lower mixing ratios at the tropopause were CHCl 3, CH 2 Cl 2, CH 2 Br 2, and CH 3 CCl 3.

The recent Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition 2 (AASE 2) included two independent measurements of organic chlorine species using whole air sample and real-time techniques. From the whole air sample measurements we derive directly the burden of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> (CCl(y)) in the lower stratosphere. From the more limited real-time measurements we estimate the CCl(y) burden using mixing ratios and growth rates of the principal CCl(y) species in the troposphere in conjunction with results from a two-dimensional photochemical model. Since stratospheric chlorine is tropospheric in origin and tropospheric mixing ratios are increasing, {{it is necessary to}} establish the average age of a stratospheric air parcel to assess its total chlorine (Cl(sub Total)) abundance. Total inorganic chlorine (Cl(y)) in the parcel is then estimated by the simple difference, Cl(y) = Cl(sub Total) - CCl(y). The consistency of the results from these two quite different techniques suggests that we can determine the CCl(y) and Cl(y) in the lower stratosphere with confidence.

The altitude variation of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> (CCl(sub y)), total inorganic chlorine (Cl(sub y)), and the nearly constant value (3. 7 +/- 0. 2 ppbv) of their sum (Cl(sub TOT)) {{demonstrates that the}} stratospheric chlorine species available to react with O 3 are supplied by the decomposition of organic chlorinated compounds whose abundances are well quantified. Measured profiles of HCl and ClNO 3 agree well with profiles found by photochemical model (differences < 10 % for altitudes below 35 km) constrained by various other constituents measured by MkIV. The production of HCl by ClO + OH plays a relatively small role in the partitioning of HCl and ClNO 3 for the sampled air masses.

There has been a concern over the impact that the unknown fraction of TOX might have on human health. The standard TOX method cannot differentiate organic chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Ion chromatographic (IC) detection has been proposed for the halogen specific TOX analysis. ^ The first objective of this research was to determine the optimum TOX protocol for use with IC detection to analyze <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> (TOCl), bromine (TOBr), and iodine (TOI). The pyrolytic analyzer using pure O 2 and off-line IC combined with a standard TOX carbon (coconut based) worked best for the differential TOX analysis. ^ The second objective of this research was {{to assess the impact of}} bromide and iodide concentrations, different oxidation scenarios, and reaction conditions on the formation of unknown TOX. Chloramines and chlorine dioxide produced byproducts with a higher percentage of unknown TOX than free chlorine. Free chlorine formed more TOCl and TOBr than chloramines and chlorine dioxide in the presence of bromide. However, chloramines and chorine dioxide produced more TOI than chlorine and ozone in the presence of iodide. ^ The third objective was to characterize unknown TOX precursors using resin (XAD- 8, XAD- 4) extraction and ultrafiltration methodologies.

Also, the spatial distribution of the two forms of chlorine was determined. Soil samples were collected at 49 of the nodes in a grid with approximately 105 m between the nodes. The analysis of spatial variability suggested that no spatial autocorrelation was present either within the variable <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> or chloride. This means that no sample was more influenced by another nearby sample, as compared to other samples further away. Instead, linear interpolation was used to construct contour maps of the concentrations. The contour maps indicated that the two forms of chlorine have similar spatial patterns and the highest concentrations could be found in the main valley area, with moss soil and forest dominated by pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)). The two variables showed a significant positive correlation. This could be {{due to the fact that}} chloride is the limiting factor for formation in Swedish soil or that the two forms of chlorine are only indirectly related through variables as soil moisture or organic matter. The storage of <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> when a depth of 40 cm was taken into account was seven times the storage compared to an earlier study where only the top-soil was sampled. The storage of <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the area is of such size that changes in this storage are likely to have an impact on the transport of chloride. The fact that no spatial autocorrelation could be found in either of the variables suggests that the scale chosen is not suitable for describing spatial autocorrelation on a smaller level, due to processes e. g. microbially induced formation.

40|$|The {{formation}} of disinfection by-products (DBPS) {{is a public}} health concern. An important way to evaluate the presence of DBPs {{is in terms of}} the total organic halogen (TOX), which can be further specified into <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> (TOCl), bromine (TOBr), and iodine (TOI). The formation and distribution of halogen-specific TOX during chlorination and chloramination of natural organic matter (NOM) isolates in the presence of bromide and iodide ions were studied. As expected, chloramination produced significantly less TOX than chlorination. TOM was the dominant species formed in both chlorination and chloramination. TOI was always produced in chloramination, but not in chlorination when high chlorine dose was used, due to the limited presence of HOI in chlorination {{as a result of the}} oxidation of iodide to iodate in the presence of excess chlorine. The {{formation of}} TOI during chloramination increased as the initial iodide ion concentration increased, with a maximum of similar to 60 % of the initial iodide ion becoming incorporated into NOM. Iodine incorporation in NOM was consistently higher than bromine incorporation, demonstrating that the competitive reactions between bromine and iodine species in chloramination favoured the formation of HOI and thus TOI, rather than TOBr. Correlations between the aromatic character of the NOM isolates (SUVA(254) and % aromatic C) and the concentrations of overall TOX and halogen-specific TOX in chloramination were observed. This indicates that the aromatic moieties in NOM, as indicated by SUVA(254) and % aromatic C, play an important role in the formation of overall TOX and halogen-specific TOX in chloramination. THMs comprised only a fraction of TOX, up to 7 % in chloramination and up to 47 % in chlorination. Although chloramine produces less TOX than chlorine, it formed proportionally more non-THM DBPs than chlorine. These non-THM DBPs are mostly unknown, corresponding to unknown health risks. Considering the higher potential for formation of iodinated DBPs and unknown DBPs associated with the use of chloramine, water utilities need to carefully balance the risks and benefits of using chloramine as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine in order to satisfy guideline values for THMs...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the middle atmosphere circulation to ozone depletion and increase in greenhouse gases is assessed by performing multiyear simulations with a chemistry-climate model. Three simulations with fixed boundary conditions have been carried out: one simulation for the near-past (1960) and two simulations for the near-present (1990 and 2000) conditions, including changes in greenhouse gases, in <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine,</b> and in average sea surface temperatures. Changes in ozone are simulated interactively by the coupled model. It is found that in the stratosphere, ozone decreases, {{and that in the}} Antarctic, the ozone hole develops in both the 1990 and the 2000 simulations but not in the 1960 simulation, as observed. The simulated temperature decreases in the stratosphere and mesosphere from the near past to the present, with the largest changes at the stratopause and at the South Pole in the lower stratosphere, in agreement with current knowledge of temperature trends. In the Arctic lower stratosphere, a cooling in March with respect to the 1960 simulation is found only for the 2000 simulation. Wave activity emerging from the troposphere is found to be comparable in the winters of the 1960 and 2000 simulations, suggesting that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases increase contribute to the 2000 - 1960 March cooling in the Arctic lower stratosphere. These results therefore provide support to the interpretation that the extreme low temperatures observed in March in the last decade can arise from radiative and chemical processes, although other factors cannot be ruled out. The comparison of the 1960 and 2000 simulations shows an increase in downwelling in the mesosphere at the time of cooling in the lower stratosphere (in March in the Arctic; in October in the Antarctic). The mesospheric increase in downwelling can be explained as the response of the gravity waves to the stronger winds associated with the cooling in the lower stratosphere. Planetary waves appear to contribute to the downward shift of the increased downwelling, with a delay of about a month. The increase in dynamical heating associated with the increased downwelling may limit the cooling and the strengthening of the lower stratospheric polar vortex from above, facilitating ozone recovery and providing a negative dynamical feedback. In both the Arctic and Antarctic the cooling from ozone depletion is found to affect the area covered with polar stratospheric clouds in spring, which is substantially increased from the 1960 to the 2000 simulations. In turn, increased amounts of polar stratospheric clouds can facilitate further ozone depletion in the 2000 simulation...|$|E
40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) is a {{collective}} parameter and a toxicity indicator for all halogenated organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) {{in a water}} sample. TOX performs like “a master parameter”, and its significance to DBP studies cannot be overestimated. TOX can be measured with the adsorption–pyrolysis method based on Standard Method 5320 B. This method involves concentration of organic halogens from water by adsorption onto activated carbon (AC), and removal of inorganic halides present on the AC by competitive displacement by nitrate ions. Since AC can also act as a reductant, this work first studied whether the reduction of chlorinated DBPs by AC occurs during the TOX measurement, {{to what extent the}} reduction affects the measurement of TOX, what types of chlorinated DBPs can be reduced by AC, and how the TOX measurement can be improved. Chlorinated Suwannee River fulvic acid samples were prepared and pretreated with precipitation/dialysis/ultrafiltration to minimize the chloride levels in the samples. It was found that the fractions of “TOX” in the precipitated, dialyzed and ultrafiltered samples that were reduced by AC in 5 -min contact were ~ 13 %, 20 % and 24 %, respectively. The formation of some N-chloroamino compounds and their reactivity with AC were examined. The results indicate that organic chloramines are one type of DBPs in TOX that can be reduced by AC. It was demonstrated that slight oxidation of AC with ozone (OAC) inhibited its reduction for TOX and meanwhile maintained its adsorption capacity for TOX. The development of the TOX method in recent years lies in the differentiation of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> (TOCl), total organic bromine (TOBr) and total organic iodine (TOI) by detecting halides with off-line ion chromatography. Whether the reduction of brominated/iodinated DBPs by AC occurs during the TOBr/TOI measurement was also examined. The results show that TOBr was sometimes reduced by AC to bromide, but the reduction was not as significant as that of TOCl; the reduction of TOI to iodide was not significant. The results suggested that 10 % or less of brominated Suwannee River fulvic acid was reduced to bromide. The method for the TOBr measurement was improved by using OAC when reduction occurred on AC. The improved method was also evaluated on treated wastewater and swimming pool water samples. The effect of quenching time on the TOCl/TOBr measurement was also studied. The appropriate quenching time was found to be 15 - 60 min. The improved TOX method was used to determining the TOCl and TOBr levels from different disinfection processes, including chlorination, chloramination, ozonation, and chlorine dioxide treatment. Depending on the NOM sources and disinfection processes, the increments of TOCl and TOBr measured with OAC were 10 - 20 % and 5 - 10 %, respectively. Because of the low TOCl and TOBr concentrations in the chlorine dioxide and ozone treated samples, the differences measured with AC and OAC were not significant. Therefore, the use of OAC in the TOCl/TOBr measurement may give more accurate results for chlorinated and chloraminated samples. The penetration of (highly) polar brominated DBPs through AC or OAC columns were explored with six simulated drinking water samples and two chlorinated wastewater effluent samples. Both known and unknown polar brominated DBPs were selectively detected with a novel precursor ion scan method using electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The results show that 5 - 25 % of polar brominated DBPs in the drinking water samples penetrated through AC, and higher percentages of polar brominated DBPs in the chlorinated wastewater effluent samples penetrated through AC. Compared with AC, OAC was demonstrated to be an improved adsorbent which can significantly minimize the penetration of polar brominated DBPs during the TOBr analysis...|$|E

Chlorine dioxide has drawn much recent attention {{as an alternative}} disinfectant and oxidant for drinking water to replace chlorine because of its powerful disinfecting ability and its limited capacity to produce organohalogenated compounds. However, the use of chlorine dioxide leads to chlorite (ClO 2 -) and chlorate (ClO 3 -) as inorganic oxidation by-products which are reported to have toxic effects on humans. The reactions of ClO 2 with simple organic compounds (phenols, aliphatic and aromatic amines [...] .) produce polar compounds such as quinone, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids while oxydation by-products of dissolved organic matter of surface waters (in particular humic substances) are largely unknown. Consequently, {{the aim of this}} work was to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water treatment To this end, experiments were carried out with dilute aqueous solutions of an isolated aquatic humic acid (Pinail humic acid, PHA) and the objectives of this present study were :- To evaluate the ClO 2 demand and to determine the productions of chlorite, chlorate and of organohalogenated compounds such as trihalomethanes (THMs), dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acids (DCA, TCA) which are the main organohalogenated products formed by chlorination. - To show the effects of chlorine dioxide preoxidation on organic halide formation potentials (postchlorination) and on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by activated carbon. In addition, reactions of chlorite with chlorine or with activated carbon were also examined. EXPERIMENTALPniail humic acid was dissolved in phosphate buffered ultra-pure water (pH = 7. 5).

Stock solutions of chlorine dioxide (4 - 6 g l- 1) and of chlorine (6 - 10 g l- 1) were prepared in the laboratory and titrated by iodometry. Residual chlorine dioxide concentration in PHA solutions was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 360 nm and by two colorimetric methods : the chlorophenol red and the ACVK methods. Concentrations of DOC and of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> or halogen (TOCI, TOX) were measured using a DOHRMANN DC 80 carbon analyser and a DOHRMANN DX 20 A TOX analyser equipped with a microcoulometric cell, respectively. THMs, DCA and TCA were determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63 Ni electron capture detector after extraction by pentane for the THMs, and methylation in ether phase for DCA and TCA. Inorganic chlorine species were analysed by HPLC with a UV detector (ClO 2 -) or by chromatography (Cl-, ClO 3 -). RESULTS• Oxidation of PHA by ClO 2 The results showed that PHA consumed about 2 mg of ClO 2 /mg of DOC after a reaction time of 24 hours (fig. 1) and that there is a rapid consumption of ClO 2 during the first 30 minutes of the reaction (fig. 2) Oxidation by ClO 2 had no effect on DOC concentration (DOC removal : < 10 %) and led to a significant decrease (about 30 %) of the UV-absorbance at 254 or 270 nm (fig. 1 and 2), and to productions of ClO 2 - (0, 65 mg of ClO 2 -/mg of ClO 2 consumed) which were independant of the applied oxidant dose and of the reaction time. Furthermore, after a 72 hour reaction time in the dark, chlorine dioxide ([ClO 2] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, [PHA] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, DOC = 2, 6 mg l- 1) produces very small amounts of chloroform (< 5 µg l- 1), DCA (5 µg l- 1) and TCA (5 µg l- 1) and organochlorinated compounds (TOCl : 36 µg/mg DOC) compared to chlorine oxidation (tableau 1). However, in the presence of sunlight, ClO 2 is rapidly photodecomposed (fig. 3) and the photodegradation products of ClO 2 allow bromide oxidation (fig. 11) and lead to higher productions of organohalogenated compounds such as THMs (fig. 4). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by chlorinationAs shown in figure 5, chlorine dioxide preoxidation reduces the production of organohalogenated compounds and the chlorine demand during postchlorination. For a preoxidant dose corresponding to the ClO 2 demand of PHA, the decrease in the formation potentials of CHCl 3, DCA, TCA and TOCl was about 40 - 50 %. These results confirm the similarity of the action of chlorine dioxide and chlorine on aromatic structures which have high electron density carbons and which constitute probably the most reactive precursors of organohalogenated by-products. As far as chlorite concentration is concerned, the results showed that chlorite formed during the preoxidation step was completely oxidized to chlorate during postchlorination, under the experimental conditions used in this study (chlorine dose : 40 mg l- 1; contact time : 24 or 72 hours). Because of the reactions of chlorine eh chlorine and with residual chlorine dioxide, a small increase in the chlorine demand was observed when PHA solutions were heavily preoxidized (fig. 5). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by activated carbon treatmentBatch experiments were carried out with a powdered activated carbon (PAC, granulometry : < 80 µm) which was obtained by crushing a commercial granular activated carbon (CECA 40, 12 x 40 mesh). Once equilibrium was achieved (contact time : 10 days), adsorption isotherms indicated that chlorine dioxide preoxidation increases the absorbability of DOC on activated carbon (fig; 4 tableau 2). Furthermore, chlorite in oxidized PHA solutions was reduced by PAC to chloride. The capacity of CECA 40 activated carbon for ClO 2 - reduction to Cl- was about 170 mg ClO 2 -/g of PAC (fig. 7). Other experiments showed that chlorite may react with specific surface groups on PAC to produce inorganic carbon (fig. 7) and with PHA only in the presence of PAC as shown the DOC and UV-absorbance curves in figure 8 and the increase of TOX concentration in the liquid phase in figure 9. Thus the observed increase in DOC absorbability on PAC after a chlorine dioxide preoxidation may be attributed to cheminal interactions between PAC, chlorite, residual chlorine dioxide and adsorbed organic matter and requires further study...|$|E

Concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) and trichloramine (NCl(3)) in air {{as well as}} concentrations of parameters, including <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> carbon (TOC), <b>chlorine</b> (free, combined and total), pH, Kjeldhal nitrogen (KN), chloride ions and THMs in water and air temperature, were measured. Water and air samples were collected during 3 h {{in the morning and}} afternoon, during high and low attendance days, in summer and winter. Data analysis was perfomed by multivariate ordinary least square (OLS) and quantile (QR) regressions, from both data quality and other parameters such as the ratio between the number of visitors and the volume of water available V/W, the proportion of air re-circulated and the number of swimmers during sampling. The geometric means (GM± 95 % CIs) of the sum of THMs (TTHM) and NCl(3) in air were 74. 9 ± 6. 7 μg/m(3) and 190 ± 10 μg/m(3), respectively. As expected, concentrations of TTHM in air were correlated to concentrations of TTHM in water. Concentrations of TTHM and NCl(3) in air measured in winter were significantly higher than in summer, depicting that low air exchange rate in winter lead to accumulation of pollutants. NCl(3) (especially at higher quantiles) and TTHM concentrations in air were associated to the number of swimmers. NCl(3) was also linked to air temperature and pH. Moreover TTHM and NCl(3) in air seemed to be affected by additional determinants including the volume of hall and the ratio V/W. In a process of reducing exposure, the OLS regression provides useful information on key parameters influencing concentrations of THMs and NCl(3) in indoor swimming pools. In addition, QR allows identifying factors associated to elevated levels of contamination...|$|R

40|$|BIOVERT:RAFFINAGE+CCO:EKU:PAF:ASOEfficient {{disposal}} of pollutants {{is a key}} problem in the environmental context. In particular, chlorinated aromatic compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation and conventional treatment methods. Iron phthalocyanines were previously shown to be efficient catalysts for the oxidative degradation of chlorinated phenols considered as priority pollutants. We have recently discovered mu-nitrido diiron phthalocyanines as powerful oxidation catalysts. Herein, we evaluate these emerging catalysts in the oxidation of chlorinated phenols in comparison with conventional mononuclear complex. Catalytic performance of iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine (FePcS) and corresponding mu-nitrido dimer [(FePcS) (2) N] have been compared in the oxidation of chlorinated phenols by hydrogen peroxide in water. The oxidative degradation of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol (DCP) and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) has been studied. The (FePcS) (2) N exhibited better catalytic properties than mononuclear FePcS in terms of conversion and mineralization (transformation of <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> to Cl- and decrease of <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> carbon due {{to the formation of}} CO 2). Kinetics of the DCP oxidation indicated that different reaction mechanisms are involved in the presence of FePcS and (FePcS) (2) N. The high catalytic activity of (FePcS) (2) N in the degradation and mineralization of chlorinated phenols make mu-nitrido diiron phthalocyanines promising catalyst to apply also in environmental remediation.
