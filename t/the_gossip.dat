5|$|Anne's {{second cousin}} George of Hanover (her {{eventual}} successor) visited London {{for three months}} from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle {{as part of a}} scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, as a result of <b>the</b> <b>gossip,</b> he was temporarily dismissed from court.|$|E

5|$|His successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both {{finished}} trophyless after a season, {{not meeting}} the club's high expectations. During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in <b>the</b> <b>gossip</b> {{pages of the}} press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname FC Hollywood. Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.|$|E

5|$|The film then {{centers on}} the gala, which is {{attended}} by the Dumitrius and offers the setting for Von Debretsy's rejection of General Ipsilanti's advances. The characters' backgrounds are explained through <b>the</b> <b>gossip</b> of Madame Vorvoreanu, a distant relative of Von Debretsy, who is attending the event. The spectators are thus told that Von Debretsy {{is the daughter of}} a Romanian boyaress {{and a member of the}} Hungarian aristocracy, and that she is held in contempt by the local notabilities. In parallel, Ipsilanti himself is shown to be not just a military commander, but also as a prince.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both <b>the</b> <b>Gossip</b> and Rodes families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.|$|E
5|$|The foreign press {{suggested}} that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 to avoid <b>the</b> <b>gossip</b> which swept London {{society in the}} wake of the scandal. This is not true; the trip had actually been planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most of the extensive travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part of ceremonies. In the style of the time, a great many animals were shot for sport.|$|E

5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>gossip</b> columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the rendezvous problem is to construct a method that enables a population of agents {{to agree on a}} spatial (and possibly temporal) meeting location. We introduce <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm as a general solution to the rendezvous problem in a discrete domain with direct communication between decentralized agents. We compare the performance of <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm against <b>the</b> well known uniform gossip algorithm. We believe that a buffered solution is preferable to an unbuffered solution, such as <b>the</b> uniform <b>gossip</b> algorithm, because <b>the</b> use of a buffer allows an agent to use multiple information sources when determining its desired rendezvous point, and that access to multiple information sources may improve agent decision making by reinforcing or contradicting an initial choice. To show that <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm is an actual solution for the rendezvous problem, we construct a theoretical proof of convergence and derive the conditions under which <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm is guaranteed to produce a consensus on rendezvous location. We use these results to verify that <b>the</b> uniform <b>gossip</b> algorithm also solves the rendezvous problem. We then use a multi-agent simulation to conduct a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance between the buffered and uniform gossip algorithms. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm can solve the rendezvous problem faster than <b>the</b> uniform <b>gossip</b> algorithm; however, <b>the</b> relative performance between these two solutions depends on the specific constraints of the problem and the parameters of <b>the</b> buffered <b>gossip</b> algorithm...|$|R
