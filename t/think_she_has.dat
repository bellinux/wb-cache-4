500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's {{probably}} a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{been very}} rude {{to a lot}} of people in the past, on her way up – very terse," [...] a friend told the Observer. [...] "She doesn't do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Sagan {{organized}} a concert with singer Joan Baez, {{one of her}} Atherton neighbors, {{in order to raise}} money for Greek political prisoners; the concert drew more than 10,000 people. In her memoirs, Baez described Sagan during the period as having [...] "the gifts of an active mind, a love of life and beauty, an unquashable spirit, and a faith in people very much like that of Anne Frank." [...] In the three years that followed, Sagan traveled throughout the American West, founding 75 more AI chapters. By 1978, AI USA's membership had increased to 70,000, more than 100 times that of a decade before. An AI spokesman later attributed Sagan with doing more than anyone to establish Amnesty International in the US, adding that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> probably organized more people {{than anyone else in the}} human rights movement globally". She also founded the organization's first newsletter, Matchbox, in 1973.|$|E

500|$|Gilsig {{referred}} to the confrontation between Terri and Will in the episode [...] "Mattress" [...] as [...] "The Reckoning". She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: [...] "What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear." [...] Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: [...] "I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [...] Will finally reflects {{that he is a}} fully evolved human being and puts two and two together." [...] She noted that while Will and Emma [...] "are adorable together", she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple: [...] "I think that she really loves him.

500|$|Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, {{a real-life}} New Yorker who found passion and {{enlightenment}} teaching violin to the inner-city kids of East Harlem, {{in the music}} drama Music of the Heart (1999). A departure from director Wes Craven's previous work in films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna, who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day. Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she {{may be the most}} versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood." ...|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{become a}} popular {{character}} among audience of both genders for various reasons. Model and actress Jaime Bergman chose the [...] "quick and bold" [...] Ayane as a Dead or Alive 2 character she would partner with. While awarding the Annual GameSpy E3 Award to Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, Raymond 'Psylancer' Padilla wrote, [...] "Ayane should be my new girlfriend." [...] He later elaborated: [...] "To be honest, I always thought Ayane was an uptight bitch with a massive chip on her shoulder. I always rooted for Kasumi in their feud. Then {{a funny thing happened}} when I saw the trailer for Dead or Alive Ultimate during E3 2004 -- I started to care about Ayane. Learning more about her story, her upbringing, and the root of her feud with Kasumi made me change sides." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey also described himself as [...] "more of an Ayane sort of guy." [...] In 2005, she was described as his favourite Dead or Alive character by James Mielke from 1UP.com. Featuring Ayane as a [...] "videogame babe of the day" [...] in 2009, IGN's Chris Carle commented: [...] "After that awkward goth stage in high school, not many people continue to rock the violet locks, but Ayane is different… she's hot enough to get away with it." [...] "Kayane", pseudonym of the professional gamer Marie-Laure Norindr comes from a mix of [...] "Kasumi" [...] and [...] "Ayane". Kayane said: [...] "She has a lot of charisma and is pretty. She’s full of anger but has a sweet heart in fact. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> the most interesting story and personality in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, [...] "I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented." ...|$|E

[...] "I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses," [...] Braun said. Reese's wardrobe goes {{back and forth between the}} two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. [...] "She's an architect, so to me, I would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a real eye for lines," [...] said Braun.
