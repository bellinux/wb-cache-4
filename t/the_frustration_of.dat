5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was {{virtually}} destroyed, {{with the remainder}} waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army. But much to <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate {{the dead and the}} wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|During {{the entire}} period of 1970–74, FRELIMO {{intensified}} guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating {{that they had}} become responsible for two {{out of every three}} Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO used a variety of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, including the PMN (Black Widow), TM-46, and POMZ. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the PDM. Mine psychosis, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces. This fear, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces, damaged morale and significantly hampered progress.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social stigma {{attached}} to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took {{matters into their own hands}} and stole illicit goods back while impounded.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), {{in a rare}} exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{was elected to the}} Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{blood was}} shed deep in Malaysian territory, with the Indonesian-staged Brunei Revolt on 8 December 1962. This operation, {{with the goal}} of seizing the oilfields as well as European hostages, was swiftly crushed by British forces that flew in from Singapore. The {{conflict}} proper, however, began in April of the following year, as 'volunteer' Indonesian forces made occasional raids across the Sarawak border. These raids were small, generally composed of groups smaller than platoon size, and their damage was minimised with relative ease by local security forces. The turning point came on 16 September, when the Malaysian Federation was formally created. In Indonesia, the response to <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> their plans to prevent the Federation's birth was serious and violent. A mob converged upon the British embassy in Jakarta, smashing windows and doors in protest. Sukarno authorised stronger raids by Indonesian regular forces, and even launched seaborne attacks into peninsular Malaysia. The raiding would continue {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked off}} the match, but within the first two minutes they had conceded a goal. A foul on Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy by United captain Roy Keane {{resulted}} in a Liverpool penalty, which Gary McAllister subsequently scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a free kick, but McAllister was unable to score, hitting Manchester United's defensive wall. United had their first chance two minutes later, but Van Nistelrooy miscued his shot in front of goal. In the 11th minute, Liverpool's lead was almost extended as United midfielder Nicky Butt almost diverted a cross from Riise into his own goal. Five minutes later, Liverpool did extend their lead; United defender Jaap Stam slipped after Liverpool striker Emile Heskey headed the ball down to Michael Owen, allowing Owen to sidestep Gary Neville and place his shot into the United goal to make the score 2–0. <b>The</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> the United players was beginning to show and immediately after the goal, Paul Scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|Oan, {{angered by}} the BBC's {{incorrect}} reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the latter was apparently released {{for no other reason than}} his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night.|$|E

25|$|Cruise control {{automatically}} {{controls the}} rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle {{of the car to}} maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.|$|E
