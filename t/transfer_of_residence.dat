On his first performance, he delivered his rendition of [...] "Secrets" [...] by OneRepublic. Rey Valera, one of the judges, commented that Mangubat's voice seemed to fit better on the rock ballad genre and that it sounded [...] "imported". Garnering an average score of 94.4% from the judges, Mangubat won against the two other contenders vying to challenge the current defending winner. On his second performance, he sang [...] "Flying Without Wings" [...] by Westlife for which he garnered an average score of 95.6% eventually beating the defending champion. His winning streak continued until the fifth day when he lost to the daily winner missing his slot in the semifinals of the quarter.|$|E
60|$|The {{worst of}} such predicaments is, my dear Charles, {{that when one}} does write, {{everything}} one has, at a thousand scattered moments, previously wanted to say, seems to have dried up with desuetude and neglect. Oh, {{all the things that}} should have been said on the spot if they were ever to be said at all! This applies, you will immediately recognise--though it's a stern truth by which I suffer most--very poignantly to all the utterance I feel myself to have so odiously failed of {{at the time of the}} death of dear Burne-Jones. I can only give you a very partially lucid account of why on that occasion at least no word from me reached you. I saw myself, heard myself, felt myself, not write--and yet even then knew perfectly both that I should be writing now and that I should now be sorrier than ever for not writing then. It came, the miserable event, at the very moment I was achieving, very single-handed and unassisted, a complicated <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> from London to this place, with all sorts of bewildering material detail (consequent on renovation, complete preparation of every kind, of old house and garden) adding its distraction to the acute sense of pressing work fatally retarded and blighted; so that a postponement which has finally grown to this monstrous length began with being a thing only of moments and hours. Then, moreover, it was simply so wretched and odious to feel him, by a turn of the wheel of fate that had taken but an instant, gone for ever from sight and sound and touch. I was tenderly attached to him, with abundant reason for being, and there was something that choked and angered me beyond what words could trust themselves to express, in the mere blind bêtise of the business. So the days and the weeks went. I went up from here to town, and thence to Rottingdean, for the committal of his ashes, there, to the earth of the little grey-towered churchyard, in sight of the sea, that was at the moment all smothered in lovely spring flowers. It was a day of extraordinary beauty, and in every way a quite indescribably sincere--I remember I could find at the time no other word for the impression--little funeral and demonstration. The people from London were those, almost all, in whose presence there was a kind of harmony.... I had seen the dear man, to my great joy, only a few hours before his death: meeting him at a kind of blighted and abortive wedding-feast (that is a dinner before a marriage that was to take place on the morrow) from which we were both glad to disembroil ourselves: so that we drove together home, intimately moralising and talking nonsense, and he put me, in the grey London midnight, down at my corner to go on by himself to the Grange. It was the last time I saw him, and, as one always does, I have taken ever since a pale comfort in the thought that our parting was explicitly affectionate and such, almost, as one would have wished it even had one known. I miss him even here and now. He was one of the most loveable of men and most charming of friends--altogether and absolutely distinguished. I think his career, as an artistic one, and speaking quite apart from the degree of one's sympathy with his work, one of the greatest of boons to our most vulgar of ages. There was no false note in him, nothing to dilute the strain; he knew his direction and held it hard--wrought with passion and went as straight as he could. He was for all this always, to me, a great comfort. For the rest death came to him, I think, at none so bad a moment. He had, essentially, to my vision, really done. And he was very tired, and his cup was, with all the mingled things, about as full as it would hold. It was so good a moment, in short, that I think his memory is already feeling the benefit of it in a sort of rounded finished way. I was not at the sale of his pictures and drawings which took place after his death--I have not stirred from this spot since I came to it at the end of June; but though I should immensely have cherished some small scrap, everything went at prices--magnificent for his estate--that made acquisition a vain dream.... I have had--and little wonder--scant news of you. I know you've renounced your professorship. I know you felt strongly on public events. But I am in a depressed twilight--of discrimination, I mean--that enables me to make less of these things than I should like to do. So much has come and gone, these six months, that how can I talk about it? It's strange, the consciousness possible to an American here to-day, of being in a country in which the drift of desire--so far as it concerns itself with the matter--is that we shall swell and swell, and acquire and require, to the top of our opportunity. My own feeling, roughly stated, is that we have not been good enough for our opportunity--vulgar, in a manner, as that was and is; but it may be the real message of the whole business to make us as much better as the great grabbed-up British Empire has, unmistakeably, made the English. But over these abysses--into them rather--I peer with averted eye. I fear I am too lost in the mere spectacle for any decent morality. Good-bye, my dear Charles, and forgive my mechanic volubility. Isn't it better to have ticked and shocked than never to have ticked at all? I send my love to all your house....|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to modernism, the postmodern view underscores {{the ways in}} which realities are constituted personally or socially, and one's self or identity is viewed as a process or as a constituted subject. It assumes that human being and culture are mutually constructed. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> from one culture to another is not only a change of a sociocultural environment but also accompanied by the restructuring of one's self, identity and meaning system. This paper proposes to investigate the latter process, especially how they recognize the self and the other. Thus the approach is phenomenological because the subjects find, accept and construct the reality around them. Regarding this matter, the interview was held with 24 Nepalese those who has been living in Japan. In the beginning, they were very conscious about the nationality. As they live longer, they change, that is, they judge people not as Japanese or Nepalese but as an individual. It is shown that the way to recognize their self and the other is deeply connected and that relation is interdependent. By adopting the 'relation'between self and other as a central concept of the analysis, the change of how they recognize the self and the other {{can be seen as a}} change of categorization. As a result, it shifts the boundary between the self and the other...|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} the {{retained}} interest, as will be explained in more detail below, is important for gift tax purposes. Because the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>residence</b> to the PRT is a completed gift, it is desirable to minimize the {{value of the}} gift. The gift is valued at the fair market value <b>of</b> the <b>residence,</b> less {{the value of the}} retained interest.

40|$|It {{is universally}} {{known that the}} {{approach}} towards tax law has always been characterized by strong differences between indirect and direct taxation. The need for harmonization concerning the system of value added tax, for the uniformity regarding customs law and for a similar framework {{in the field of}} excise duties, still cope with a secondary Community legislation in the field of direct taxation that is fragmented, incomplete and episodic. This {{is the result of a}} necessary compromise imposed by a decision-making model which is no longer compatible with the zeitgeist of the new millennium. From this point of view neither the Charter of Nice nor the new European Constitution in Rome (even the abridged version that has prevailed at the latest meeting in Berlin) appear to be adequate to change this approach. Interventions in the field of direct taxation, both for individuals and for certain businesses, such as trading companies and permanent establishments, are focused on areas in which bilateral treaties did not provide an adequate protection to the taxpayer, or where the contractual nature of the instrument clearly demonstrates an intrinsic inadequacy. Thus, the 1990 / 435 / EEC [2], 2003 / 48 /EC [3], 2003 / 49 /EC [4] and, of most interest here, the 1990 / 434 /CEE [5] directives came to light, among others. Leaving aside the crucial role played by the European Court of Justice on the progressive removal of barriers to a common market and, indirectly, the approximation of laws in those areas that clash with a more effective harmonization, it remains that all the above-mentioned instruments still show an unmistakable common characteristic: they are all oriented to minimize the occurrence of double taxation on passive income. Dividends, interest and royalties now benefit from an EU framework intended to apportion the taxing powers amongst the different States potentially interested (State of residence of the payee and the payer, for instance). The only exception in this respect is the one related to the regime of capital gains. If arguably practical reasons have excluded such a need in the case of realization of capital gains determined by the sale of securities or other property, the EU legislator was concerned with this issue only when taxation of capital gains do not guarantee the neutrality imposed by the Treaty (in general) and the fundamental freedoms laid down and protected by it. In this context, reference was made to specific extraordinary corporate operations (mergers, divisions and transfers of assets, for example) suitable to generate capital gains taxable in two European states at least, considering as such the States where the companies involved are placed, or where the assets are dislocated. With the last mentioned Directive, 1990 / 434 /CEE (so called “Parent – Subsidiary), the EU lawmaker has confirmed this need for tax neutrality for the above-mentioned corporate operations, giving the full fiscal neutrality to extraordinary corporate reorganization that could generate potentially taxable gains. This is true especially in cases where a company was, for example, merged with another resident in another European country, ending up with the former which had to leave its residence in the State of origin (even in this case would be more appropriate to conclude that it was actually winded up to all relevant effects). Among the cases classified as “extraordinary” in the Directive, the simple transfer of registered office of the company is never mentioned despite it could be considered an extraordinary corporate operation from the point of view of many legal systems, including the Italian one, where it is not entirely prohibited (such is the case for the Netherlands). Even if we ignore for now the taxation of individuals, a tax loophole seems already to emerge. In recent years doctrine, jurisprudence and the European Commission have tried to provide an adequate response to it. This is the problem of the so-called “Exit taxes” as introduced by the scientific literature with respect to its possible incompatibility with EC law, and confronted by the EU Commission in a quite original way. The problem that we raise in this short survey, apart from the comment of the ECJ case law which was discussed elsewhere, is the mobility within the EU and the relevance of such income transfers, whether they involve individuals or corporate entities, or both. In this perspective the question is undoubtedly peculiar: it pertains not only to a case of income transfer, but rather to a sort of “trans-nationality” involving, on the one hand, the status of the taxpayer (who belongs at the beginning to a State and subsequently to another within the EU, and on the other hand, whether one or both States attach importance to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> abroad, up to what amount of his/her taxable base can be taxed in the former or in the latter, perhaps in a later time. The transfer of registered office or residence from one State to another is still, under many circumstances, comparable to the realization of unrealized capital gains on specific assets, according to the State in question. The taxation of capital gains is sometimes carried out (especially following the case law cited above) in a subsequent moment (maybe in a different tax period and in coincidence with the effective realization of the asset on the market) while other times, as still happens in the Italian system, it even coincides with the transfer of headquarters abroad, at least for corporations. In brief, what seems to emerge from this partial reconstruction is a framework in which every European country makes its own tax claim potentially different from those of other countries with respect to the same situation. The absence (or apparent absence) of specific rules to regulate mobility within the Union in terms of taxes emphasises the potential conflict between States, and therefore international double taxation within the EU, as mentioned above. From this array of mutually-conflicting claims, there are two certainties: first, that in a system such as the current one, corporate and personal mobility is still strongly affected, in terms and conditions, and arguably not consistently with the provisions of the Treaty, and secondly, that something has been lost (or perhaps never acquired by the Union, namely what in taxation could be revised as Nomos of tax territoriality...|$|E
