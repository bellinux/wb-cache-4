In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

25|$|Guerrilla {{operations}} typically {{include a}} variety of strong surprise attacks on transportation routes, individual groups of police or military, installations and structures, economic enterprises, and targeted civilians. Attacking in small groups, using camouflage and often captured weapons of that enemy, the guerrilla force can constantly keep pressure on its foes and diminish its numbers, while still allowing escape with relatively few casualties. The intention of such attacks is not only military but political, aiming to demoralize target populations or governments, or goading an overreaction that forces the population to take sides for or against the guerrillas. Examples range from <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> off of limbs in various internal African rebellions, to the suicide bombings in Israel and Sri Lanka, to sophisticated manoeuvres by Viet Cong and NVA forces against military bases and formations.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to use the simple diode-capacitor circuits described above to double the voltage of a DC source by preceding the voltage doubler with a chopper circuit. [...] In effect, this converts the DC to AC before application to the voltage doubler. [...] More efficient circuits can be built by driving the switching devices from an external clock so that both functions, <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> and multiplying, are achieved simultaneously. [...] Such circuits are known as switched capacitor circuits. [...] This approach is especially useful in low-voltage battery-powered applications where integrated circuits require a voltage supply greater than the battery can deliver. [...] Frequently, a clock signal is readily available on board the integrated circuit and little or no additional circuitry is needed to generate it.|$|E

40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF 2 (eIF 2 α-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because {{there are multiple}} mammalian eIF 2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme {{is referred to as}} the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF 2 α-P is that encoding <b>the</b> transcription factor <b>CHOP</b> (DDIT 3 /GADD 153). Enhanced levels of CHOP promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation of CHOP mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5 '-leader of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF and <b>the</b> biological consequences of loss of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF on CHOP expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at <b>the</b> downstream <b>CHOP</b> coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion of <b>the</b> <b>CHOP</b> uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern of induction of <b>CHOP</b> expression in <b>the</b> ISR. Enhanced <b>CHOP</b> expression leads to increased expression of key CHOP target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedComputer based tools {{were developed to}} search water wave data for a collective mode predicted by wave turbulence theory. A low frequency wave, the "swell", can drive the collective mode by compressing and expanding the field of high frequency waves, the "chop". Through non-linear interactions, <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> responds with its own collective stiffness and inertia. This inertia should cause modulations of <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> amplitude to lag in phase behind the forcing from the swell. Two methods are presented for investigating the phase relationships between <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> amplitude and <b>the</b> swell. Method one employs the Fast Fourier Transform to examine directly the power levels at various frequencies. Method two employs digital signal processing to separate <b>the</b> swell and <b>chop</b> frequencies and <b>the</b> Hubert Transform to compute the instantaneous phase of the swell and instantaneous amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>chop.</b> Various plotting techniques permit {{the examination of the}} relationships between the amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>chop</b> and <b>the</b> phase of the swell.

2500|$|No one {{was really}} safe from {{scrutiny}} or <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> block, ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although {{the vast majority}} of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis [...] "'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat [...] "disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes". [...] Also, captains and sailors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.|$|E
2500|$|APD can {{manifest}} as problems {{determining the}} direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as [...] "hat" [...] with [...] "bat", [...] "there" [...] with [...] "where", etc. [...] Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word. [...] Background noise, such {{as the sound of}} a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder. Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> of words. Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April 1878, Constable Strachan, {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} Greta police station, learned that Kelly was at a certain {{shearing}} shed and went to apprehend him. As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kellys, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. He was instructed to proceed directly to Greta but instead rode to the public house at Winton, five miles from Benalla police headquarters, where he spent considerable time. On resuming his journey, he remembered that a couple of days previously he had seen in The Police Gazette an arrest warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He went to the Kelly house to arrest him, despite a police policy that at least two constables participate in visits to the Kelly homestead. Finding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>chopping</b> was licensed. The man proved to be William [...] "Bricky" [...] Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land. (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kellys and was arrested there when he refused to give information about the Kellys.) Fitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and took a seat near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. A struggle followed, and the brothers, assisted by their mother, Williamson and Skillian, soon over-powered the constable, and he was beaten to the ground insensible. On regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped. On regaining safety he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer.|$|E
