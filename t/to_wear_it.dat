5|$|When an eye injury forced Steve Yzerman (who {{normally}} wore number 19 for Canada) to {{miss the}} 2004 World Cup of Hockey, Sakic and Joe Thornton both refused the number {{out of respect for}} their injured countryman, even though both players each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> for Team Canada in Yzerman's absence.|$|E
5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished {{the prestige of the}} award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the most}} highly sought-after free agents, Manning {{selected}} the Denver Broncos after meeting with John Elway, a retired Broncos Hall-of-Famer quarterback who was now the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager, and Broncos head coach John Fox. Manning reached an agreement with the Broncos on a five-year contract worth $96 million on March 20, 2012. Although the #18 is retired in honor of quarterback Frank Tripucka, he gave Manning permission <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Chalcolithic era around 5600 BC, the mother-goddess of Çatalhöyük, a large ancient {{settlement}} in southern Anatolia, was depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini. Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek urns and paintings {{dating back to}} 1400 BC. Active women of ancient Greece wore a breastband called a mastodeton or an apodesmos, which continued {{to be used as}} an undergarment in the Middle Ages. While men in ancient Greece abandoned the perizoma, partly high-cut briefs and partly loincloth, women performers and acrobats continued <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|The basic {{equipment}} or kit players {{are required to}} wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of {{basic equipment}}, but players today may choose <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> {{to protect themselves from}} head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.|$|E
5|$|The final mask to {{be gained}} in the game is the Fierce Deity's Mask.

Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. His clothes turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it. The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to shoot beams at enemies.|$|E
5|$|He {{wore the}} #3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947, {{and was one}} of the last players <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the {{following}} year. On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm.|$|E

5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E
5|$|The victors {{also found}} a golden crown among the booty. It was reputed {{to be from the}} time of the fifteenth-century Majapahit empire, during which there were reports of the use of a golden crown. The crown was handed to Captain Tack of the VOC, who insisted on {{requiring}} 1,000 Rds. before giving it to the king. This behaviour seemed to offend the king and might have contributed to Tack's death at the Mataram court in 1686. On 27 November, Hurdt presented the crown to the king, who proceeded <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it.</b> In an act of cultural misunderstanding, the VOC fired musket and cannon salutes, thinking the event was a coronation in the European sense. In reality, crowns did not have ceremonial importance in Javanese royal protocol. This episode attracted much attention among later historians. Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf opined that the king would later consider this event as a symbol of the European's condescension and that they were instrumental to the king's legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it.</b> When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E
50|$|Most {{removable}} retainers are {{supplied with}} a retainer case for protection. During {{the first few}} days of retainer use, many people experience extra saliva in their mouth. This is natural and is due to the presence of a new object inside the mouth and consequent stimulation of the salivary glands. It may be difficult to speak for a while after getting a retainer, but this speech difficulty should go away over time as one gets used <b>to</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film, a dark {{psychological}} drama, stars Tom McCamus as Henry Adler, a bank {{employee and}} struggling actor who finally gets his big break, being {{cast as a}} police officer in a television series.

5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
