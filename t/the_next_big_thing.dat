During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> were considering experimental acts.|$|E

[...] Graham Finney reports [...] "At the moment, the four tracks dished up are enough to give fans a taster of what this band are about and, while it's not the most original piece of work you're ever likely to hear, if you're a fan of Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, or Bad Brains, then you'll get value for your money should you choose to shell out on this EP. For me though, while it's nice to hear Islander paying homage to their influences on Pains, it'll be nice to hear them experiment a bit more with their own ideas and really open up their wings for future releases." [...] Chelc Eaves stated [...] "Among these tracks lies a song featuring H.R. (Human Rights), lead singer of the hardcore punk band Bad Brains, and it’s a solid pairing. With the release of their new EP, Islander also made time to shoot a video for their song “New Colors,” which they shot, directed and edited in its entirety. These days, it’s refreshing to see a band come out with hard work and drive, go the distance to do everything for themselves and end up with a great formula and booming music." [...] Reggie Edwards writes [...] "If people do that to Islander, we may lose a band who has great potential, so listen up.Their debut EP, Pains., opens with “New Colors,” a track that’s reminiscent of P.O.D. meets Rage Against the Machine or Deftones with a little Norma Jean or The Chariot sprinkled in for fun.Take that and add <b>the</b> <b>next</b> track, “Lucky Rabbit,” which features H.R. of Bad Brains and you’ve got one extreme song that will blow your mind coming from a new band.With the final two tracks, “Glass” and “Big Shot,” you’ve got an EP that will make you wish it was a full-length. This band has all the makings of being one of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> <b>things</b> and in a music world where touring is the new way to make your living, Islander has what it takes.Look for them to not go anywhere anytime soon. In fact, if you see them on some big tours in the near future (Warped Tour), don’t be surprised." [...] "The last song on this EP is [...] "Big Shot", which really is a vehicle to highlight the musical ability of this band. To quote Sonny Sandoval of P.O.D.: [...] "New school band with old school soul and passion".

40|$|In {{his essay}} - Toward a Better Understanding of the Evolution of Hotel Development: A Discussion of Product-Specific Lodging Demand - by John A. Carnella, Consultant, Laventhol 2 ̆ 6 Horwath, cpas, New York, Carnella {{initially}} describes his piece by stating: “The diversified hotel {{product in the}} united states lodging market has Resulted in latent room-night demand, or supply-driven demand resulting from the introduction of a lodging product which caters to a specific set of hotel patrons. The subject has become significant as the lodging market has moved toward segmentation with regard to guest room offerings. The author proposes that latent demand is a tangible, measurable phenomenon best understood in light {{of the history of the}} guest room product from its infancy to its present state. ” The article opens with an ephemeral depiction of hotel development in the United States, both pre’ and post World War II. To put it succinctly, the author wants you to know that the advent of the inter-state highway system changed the complexion of the hotel industry in the U. S. “Two essential ingredients were necessary for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> phase of hotel development in this country. First was the establishment of the magnificently intricate infrastructure which facilitated motor vehicle transportation in and around the then 48 states of the nation,” says Carnella. “The second event…was the introduction of affordable highway travel. Carnella goes on to say that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> – <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> – in hotel evolution was the introduction of affordable air travel. “With the airways filled with potential lodging guests, developers moved next to erect a new genre of hotel, the airport hotel,” Carnella advances his picture. Growth progressed with the arrival of the suburban hotel concept, which wasn’t fueled by developments in transportation, but by changes in people’s living habits, i. e. suburban affiliations as opposed to urban and city population aggregates. The author explores the distinctions between full-service and limited service lodging operations. “The market of interest with consideration to the extended-stay facility is one dominated by corporate office parks,” Carnella proceeds. These evolutional states speak to latent demand, and even further to segmentation of the market. “Latent demand… is a product-generated phenomenon in which the number of potential hotel guests increases as the direct result of the introduction of a new lodging facility,” Carnella brings his unique insight to the table with regard to the specialization process. The demand is already there; just waiting to be tapped. In closing, “…there must be a consideration of the unique attributes of a lodging facility relative to its ability to attract guests to a subject market, just as there must be an examination of the property 2 ̆ 7 s ability to draw guests from within the subject market,” Carnella proposes...|$|R
