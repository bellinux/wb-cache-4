25|$|Taylor did {{not finish}} {{top of the}} Premier League for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> He won eight, drew four and lost four of his 16 matches to finish third in the table. He played Van Barneveld in the semi-finals who he had beaten 7–3 and drawn with 6–6 during the league stage. From 3–3, Taylor surged ahead to triumph 8–4 and book his spot in the final against Van Gerwen. Taylor started the better of the two as he led 5–3 at the break. However, he then lost four {{successive}} legs upon the resumption of play. In the 14th leg, Van Gerwen opted not {{to go for the}} bull when on 87 and Taylor stepped in to hit a 160 finish to level the match at 7–7. At 9–8 down, Taylor had left 40 after 12 darts. Nonetheless, Van Gerwen hit a 132 finish on the bull to seal a 10–8 win and the title. After the match, Taylor vowed to ease up on his schedule but increase his practice in order to play his best at the major events.|$|E

25|$|At the European Grand Prix Karthikeyan for {{the first}} time in the season {{qualified}} 22nd, ahead of the Marussia of Charles Pic, with Timo Glock missing qualifying and the race due to illness. Karthikeyan finished the race in 18th, behind Pic and de la Rosa but classified ahead of Lewis Hamilton who retired after crashing out with two laps remaining. He finished the next 3 races as the final classified finisher before retiring in Hungary due to broken suspension. He qualified last in Belgium, before running as high as 13th during the race, with good pace, before crashing out on lap 30 in broken suspension. He out-qualified his teammate de la Rosa for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> at Monza, but ended up finishing behind him in 19th. He out-qualified him again at Singapore, this time by over a second, but crashed out at turn 16 on lap 30. He qualified in 24th at Suzuka, having crashed in practice and therefore having to use an old-spec chassis floor. He was running ahead of Pic and de la Rosa for quite some time until retiring with vibrations on lap 32. He did a one-stop strategy in Korea and finished last in 20th, almost a lap behind Pic in 19th. In India he once again finished last, running with minor wing damage from a collision at the first corner. He retired in spectacular fashion on lap 9 in Abu Dhabi after his steering broke and he was rear-ended by Nico Rosberg. He qualified 24th in Austin amid fears that both he and his teammate would be outside the 107% time after struggling to heat the tyres in practice on the brand-new circuit, and then finished last in 22nd, also being accused by Vettel of holding him up when being lapped and allowing Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He qualified 23rd in Brazil and peaked as high as 11th during the incident-packed opening stint of the race. He eventually dropped back and finished last in 18th. He finished the season in 24th, with 0 points.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{names were}} used for tropical storms that formed in the northeast Pacific Ocean in 2007.

2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and those who are opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances." ...|$|E

2500|$|For 1975, the Century GS, or [...] "gran sport" [...] entered {{its third}} and final year on the Colonnade body. It {{was reduced to a}} mere appearance/handling package as the 455/Stage I options were {{discontinued}} and Buick's revived 231 cubic-inch V6 was the standard engine, mated to a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional Turbo Hydra-matic. The only optional engines were two 350 V8s, a two-barrel 155 horsepower version or the four-barrel option rated at 175 horsepower and offered only with the Turbo Hydra-matic. Both engines were also mated to catalytic converters for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> which mandated the use of unleaded gasoline and precluded the availability of true dual exhaust systems. Radial tires were now standard equipment and the Strato bucket seat option reverted to the non-reclining version.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 {{was rated}} at [...] {{and designed to}} run on lower octane regular lead, low-lead or unleaded gasoline for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> thanks to a General Motors-mandate that all engines be designed to run on such fuels {{in preparation for the}} catalytic converter equipped cars of 1975 and later years that absolutely required unleaded gasoline. Despite this, a few 1975 and 1976 Ninety Eights were released from this catalytic converter requirement in Canada and were given certification along with exemption from requiring unleaded gasoline. V8s were progressively detuned as production wore on in line with tighter emission standards. Trunk mounted louvers for the flow through ventilation system were only found on 1971 models (as in many other GM models of 1971). The louvers were moved to the doorjambs for 1972-1976 models. [...] From 1971 to 1976, Oldsmobile's full-sized Custom Cruiser station wagon shared the [...] wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Oldsmobile 98, and shared its interior and exterior styling, in particular the 98's distinctive front fascia and rear quarter panels complete with fender skirts.|$|E
6000|$|This was an eventful year, {{and less}} time was given to study than usual. In the list of his reading I find, in Greek, Theocritus, the [...] "Prometheus" [...] of Aeschylus, several of Plutarch's [...] "Lives", and the works of Lucian. In Latin, Lucretius, Pliny's [...] "Letters", the [...] "Annals" [...] and [...] "Germany" [...] of Tacitus. In French, the [...] "History of the French Revolution" [...] by Lacretelle. He read for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> Montaigne's [...] "Essays", and {{regarded}} them ever after {{as one of the}} most delightful and instructive books in the world. The list is scanty in English works: Locke's [...] "Essay", [...] "Political Justice", and Coleridge's [...] "Lay Sermon", form nearly the whole. It was his frequent habit to read aloud to me in the evening; in this way we read, this year, the New Testament, [...] "Paradise Lost", Spenser's [...] "Faery Queen", and [...] "Don Quixote".|$|E

60|$|We reached Coquimbo, {{where we}} stayed a few days. The town is {{remarkable}} for nothing but its extreme quietness. It {{is said to}} contain from 6000 to 8000 inhabitants. On {{the morning of the}} 17th it rained lightly, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> for about five hours. The farmers, who plant corn near the sea-coast where the atmosphere is more humid, taking advantage of this shower, would break up the ground; after a second they would put the seed in; and if a third shower should fall, they would reap a good harvest in the spring. It was interesting to watch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture. Twelve hours afterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever; yet after an interval of ten days all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches; the grass being sparingly scattered in hair-like fibres a full inch in length. Before this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a high-road.|$|E
