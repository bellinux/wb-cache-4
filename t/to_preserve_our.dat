25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once {{we have a better}} understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts that can be used <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>our</b> valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E

The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>our</b> position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

40|$|This {{examination}} of Submerged Cultural Resource Management (SCRM) {{is divided into}} four sections. The first section explains the background of SCRM. Underwater archaeology plays a major part in the SCRM process and therefore, its background is important to know. The background section explains how underwater archaeology came to be and how it eventually became incorporated into Submerged Cultural Resource Management. The last three sections deal with the three-phase process of SCRM. The background search, testing, and mitigation phases are all explained using both the example of an underwater archaeology field school as well as generic, theoretical examples. All four sections link together to show just how important Submerged Cultural Resource Management is <b>to</b> <b>preserving</b> <b>our</b> world's maritime and terrestrial history.

2500|$|In The Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin {{viewed the}} purport of this commandment as {{the safety of}} all being {{entrusted}} to each person. [...] All violence and injustice, and every kind of harm from which our neighbor’s body suffers is thereby prohibited. [...] Christians are therefore required to faithfully perform that which is within their power to defend the life of their neighbor, be vigilant in warding off harm, and assist in removing danger when it comes.Calvin asserts that the same rule must also be applied in regulating the mind against anger, arguing that since God sees the heart and mind, the commandment against shedding innocent blood also prohibits murder {{of the heart and}} requires a sincere desire <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>our</b> brother’s life. [...] The hand does not commit the murder unless it is conceived by the mind under the influence of wrath and hatred. [...] According to Calvin, where wrath and hatred dwell, there is an inclination to do mischief, quoting the Bible, [...] "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer"(1 John 3:15) and [...] "whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement" [...] (Gospel of Matthew 5:22).|$|E
