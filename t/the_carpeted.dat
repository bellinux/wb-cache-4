The ceiling is not flat but conical in the kiosk style, evoking the traditional tents of the early Ottomans. As in tents, there is no standing furniture but sofas set on <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> floor {{on the side of}} the walls for seating.|$|E
25|$|All mosques have rules {{regarding}} cleanliness, {{as it is}} {{an essential}} part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as wudu. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.|$|E
25|$|As mosques {{are places}} of worship, those within the mosque are {{required}} to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer. The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting images and symbols {{so as not to}} divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.|$|E

50|$|When Ctesiphon {{fell to the}} Arabs in 637, <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> was {{too heavy}} for the Iranians to carry away, and which {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> being seized by the Arabs. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, who led the Arab troops during the capture of Ctesiphon, sent <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> to <b>the</b> Rashidun caliph Umar, who was in Medina. There <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> was cut into small fragments and divided among the Arabs. One of the Arabs who received a piece of <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> was Ali who, {{although he did not}} receive the best piece, managed to sell it for 20,000 dirhams.|$|R

500|$|One of Newsom's early {{interactions}} with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement {{to install a}} sink at his PlumpJack Winery. The Health Department argued that wine was a food. The department required the store to install a $27,000 sink in <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> wine shop {{on the grounds that}} the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: [...] "That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{procedures}} for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> nozzle for <b>the</b> best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch, incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, {{and the sound of}} the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. Starting with the Model 505, adjusting <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> nozzle employed what Kirby called [...] "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action". This involved briefly lifting <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> up off <b>the</b> floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> pile.|$|R

These carpets were then held in place with individually nailed tacks driven through <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> around <b>the</b> perimeter and occasionally small rings in <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> which were folded over.|$|R

They passed down <b>the</b> <b>carpeted</b> way and through the swing-doors. Then Reist touched his companion on the arm.|$|E

50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> used in <b>the</b> interiors of cars. <b>The</b> molded <b>carpet</b> {{is designed to}} hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting <b>carpet.</b> <b>The</b> process of creating <b>the</b> molded <b>carpet</b> requires <b>the</b> original floor pans and having <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> laid upon <b>the</b> pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, easier to bend and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the floor pans. This helps prevent <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> <b>The</b> jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R

The mother drew a deep breath, and crept down the stairs with a palpitating heart to the drawing-room again.|$|E

60|$|That Sunday evening, Mr. Malone coming, as usual, {{to pass it}} {{with his}} rector, Caroline withdrew after tea to her chamber.
