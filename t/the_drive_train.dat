5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train.</b> It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train,</b> between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantages}} {{include the}} relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train,</b> the inherently lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train,</b> {{and the difficulty of}} modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.|$|E

Starting in 1970 T-55s were being armed at Uralwagonzavod 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 or KPVT loader's anti-aircraft heavy machine guns. These tanks were known as Model 1970, or sometimes T-55AM. KTD-1 or KTD-2 laser rangefinders and R-123 or R-123M radio sets were fitted to older tanks starting in 1974 (Model 1974). At the same time {{efforts were made to}} modernize and prolong the life of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was the incorporation of the camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|E

This study {{determined}} {{the effect of}} the duration of the intertrain pause on the ventricular e;^ective refractory period (VERPj measured by the extrastimuJus technique using conventionaJ eight-beat basic <b>drive</b> <b>trains.</b> In 50 subjects, the VERP was measured using a basic <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> cycle Jength of 500 msec. 2 -msec steps in the extrastimuJus coupling interval, and intertrain pauses of 0, 1, 4, 8, 20. 40, 60, or 180 seconds. The VERP increased signijicantJy with each stepwise increment in the intertrain pause up to 20 seconds, then reached a plateau. The VERP measured with an intertrain pause of 20 seconds was a mean of 13 msec longer than when measured with a conventional 4 -second pause. The results of this study demonstrate a direct relationship between the VERP and the duration of the pause separating <b>the</b> eight-beat basic <b>drive</b> <b>trains</b> used to measure the VERP. When the cycle length of <b>the</b> basic <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> is 500 msec, the VERP lengthens as the duration of the intertrain pause increases from 1 to 20 seconds, demonstrating that <b>the</b> basic <b>drive</b> <b>trains</b> exert a cumulative effect on the VERP when the intertrain pause is shorter than 20 seconds.

25|$|Moto Guzzi {{was limited}} in its endeavors to {{penetrate}} the important scooter market as motorcycle popularity waned after WWII. Italian scooter competitors would not tolerate an incursion from Moto Guzzi. By innovating the first large-wheeled scooter, Guzzi competed less directly with manufacturers of small-wheeled scooters such as Piaggio (Vespa) and Lambretta. To illustrate the delicate balance within the Italian post-war motorcycle and scooter markets, when Guzzi developed their own prototype for a small-wheeled scooter, Lambretta retaliated with a prototype for a small V-twin motorcycle threatening to directly compete on Moto Guzzi's turf. The two companies compromised: Guzzi never produced their small-wheeled scooter and Lambretta never manufactured the motorcycle. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> that Lambretta made in their 1953 motorcycle prototype remarkably resembles the V-twin + drive shaft arrangement that Guzzi developed {{more than ten years}} later, ultimately to become iconic of the company.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{recovery}} system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was incorporated into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an electrical device known as a heat motor generator unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic motor generator unit. This device was connected directly to <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way.

[...] Disadvantages to the BAE design included a weight of 70 tons and fuel efficiency of only 0.73 mpg. [...] It was argued that big, heavy vehicles are not practical in urban combat and that the infrastructure of urban and third-world countries should limit the vehicle's weight to 45 tons. [...] Others said that urban warfare tactics have become so lethal that only vehicles of this size can survive. BAE integrated the Artis Iron Curtain active protection system to defeat incoming rockets and missiles before they can hit the vehicle. [...] The Army conducted tests on the system in April 2013, and the it successfully passed all tests. [...] A prototype system for the vehicle to drive in low visibility conditions was also tested. [...] A Humvee with blacked-out windows drove through a smoke-filled mock town with the system safely, even though visibility was completely obscured. In August 2013, the BAE GCV's hybrid electric drive completed 2,000 miles of testing on a fully integrated “Hotbuck” mobility platform. [...] The Hotbuck is a stationary test stand that simulates real-life environments and terrain and puts actual miles on the HED system. Under BAE's own timeline, the testing was completed four months ahead of schedule. [...] Developing and testing actual hardware was not a program requirement for the Technology Development (TD) phase, but BAE Systems chose to demonstrate the fuel efficiency and performance of a hybrid system.|$|E
