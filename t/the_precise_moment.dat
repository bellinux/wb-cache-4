5|$|At {{the time}} of filming, Aston Martin {{were still in the}} final phases of {{designing}} the DBS. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an Aston Martin DB9 that was especially modified to look like Bond's Aston Martin DBS V12 and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moment</b> of impact. At a speed exceeding 70mph(113km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moment</b> of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moments</b> when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|R

25|$|The civil {{calendar}} in Iran since 31 March AD 1925 {{has been}} the Solar Hejri calendar. This is strictly tied to the actual northward equinox, rather than a mathematical approximation to it. An Iranian day is reckoned to begin at midnight. Iranian time is 3.5 hours ahead of GMT. New Year's Day is defined to be the day, as reckoned by Iranian time, when the northward equinox (<b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moment</b> in time when northern and southern hemispheres of the earth pass through {{the point of the}} earth's orbit when they are equally illuminated by the sun) occurs on or before noon of that day, or during the 12 hours following the noon of the preceding day. This means that the pattern of leap years in the Iranian calendar is complex – usually following a 33-year cycle where the leap day is inserted every fourth year, but in year 33 instead of year 32, but with occasional 29 - year cycles.|$|E
25|$|Unlike sculptures done by his predecessors, these {{focus on}} {{specific}} points of narrative {{tension in the}} stories {{they are trying to}} tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moment</b> that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree. They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story. Bernini's David is another stirring example of this. Michelangelo's motionless, idealized David shows the subject holding a rock {{in one hand and a}} sling in the other, contemplating the battle; similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, including Donatello's, show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath. Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath. To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind. Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the {{attempted}} murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden, {{who had been on}} a tour of England visiting relatives.

Upon learning the youth was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several notable London landmarks; an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the youth to his house on the promise of a meal and further drinks. The pair stopped at an off licence en route to Nilsen's Melrose Avenue residence and purchased whisky, rum and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill. Although Nilsen was adamant he could not recall <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moment</b> he strangled Ockenden, he recalled that he strangled the youth with the cord of his (Nilsen's) headphones as Ockenden listened to music; he also recalled dragging the youth across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing to listen to music upon the headphones with which he had strangled Ockenden.|$|E

40|$|Of all the enigmas about Gerrard Winstanley, {{perhaps the}} {{greatest}} is how did a man of unremarkable origins come to articulate {{one of the most}} penetrating and damning critiques of his own society in such powerful and crafted prose? The answer to this question has {{as much to do with}} Winstanley's spiritual progress and broadening intellectual horizons as with his increased engagement in local and national politics, which became more pronounced after the establishment of the Digger plantation. Accordingly, this essay focuses on an aspect of Winstanley's development, namely his interpretation, adaptation, and articulation of teachings characteristically – albeit not always exclusively – maintained by certain prominent Baptists and their followers. I have suggested elsewhere that the outlines, if not <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moments,</b> of Winstanley's spiritual journey can be reconstructed with confidence. Beginning in either childhood, adolescence, or some point in adulthood, he was a puritan; then perhaps a separatist; then, it can be inferred, a General Baptist; then he dispensed with the outward observance of gospel ordinances (analogous to a “Seeker”) before falling into a trance. Here, I want to build on my own work together with John Gurney's important recent studies by locating Winstanley within a milieu that makes his beliefs and subsequent practices explicable. For it appears that despite his undoubted gift for original thought, Winstanley did not always give credit where it was due...|$|R

40|$|The early {{detection}} of outbreaks of diseases {{is one of the}} most challenging objectives of epi-demiological surveillance systems. In this work, a Markov switching model is introduced to determine the epidemic and non-epidemic periods from influenza surveillance data: the pro-cess of differenced incidence rates is modelled either with a first-order autoregressive process or with a Gaussian white noise process depending on whether the system is in an epidemic or a non-epidemic phase. The transition between phases of the disease is modelled as a Markovian process. Bayesian inference is carried out on the former model to detect influenza epidemics at the very moment of their onset. Moreover, the proposal provides the probability of being in an epidemic state at any given moment. This modelling can be very helpful to identify which are the epidemic weeks during various seasons. Nevertheless, its main usefulness comes from the fact that it can be used on-line at every week in order to detect <b>the</b> very <b>precise</b> <b>moments</b> in which <b>the</b> epidemic phases starts.

40|$|The Potsdam Agreement was {{published}} as a Communiqué on 1 August 1945, following the conference {{which took place}} from 17 July 1945. I have chosen, as my contribution to this collection, {{to focus on a}} scholarly exchange which took place in 1961 – 1962, that is, more than 15 years after the Agreement, in the context {{of one of the most}} dangerous crises of the Cold War, one of <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> <b>moments</b> at which nuclear Armageddon could have been unleashed. The prota-gonists, in the pages of the American Journal of International Law were, at first sight, two distinguished jurists, both of whom had risen high in their country’s service: the international relations scholar Quincy Wright, who lived from 1890 to 1970, and was 70 years old at the time, and the lawyer and diplomat Wilhelm Grewe, who lived from 1911 to 2000, 20 years Wright’s junior, and 51 years old at the time of his reply to Wright. It is immediately apparent that the Pots-dam Agreement was very much the central matter of contention between them, Wright inclined to accept political realities but prepared to argue, against him-self, for a “return to Potsdam”, and for that reason denounced by Grewe. I start with some brief remarks on the Cold War and the events of 1961 – 62, before setting out the elements of Wright’s comments and Grewe’s heated response. Next, I explore the background of Wright, whose many writings on war in international law show him to be an irrepressible advocate of peace. Thirdly, I show in detail, referring to two scholars in particular, Bardo Fass-bender and Martti Koskenniemi, Grewe’s remarkably successful careers in the Third Reich and, after an effortless transition, in the state service of the Federal Republic of Germany. Was he nothing more than a highly regarded scholar and distinguished public servant? Fourth, therefore, I turn to Grewe’s intellectual position, which turns out to be a faithful reproduction of and commentary on the ideas of his mentor, Carl Schmitt. In his highly praised monograph, nearly 40 years in the writing and publishing, The Epochs of International Law, Grewe showed himself to be a thinker for whom the Third Reich was simply one contesting party in a normal inter-state conflict, and for whom the Holo-caust and Hitler’s other crimes did not merit comment much less explanation...|$|R

40|$|Historians of American {{religion}} and Transcendentalism {{have long known}} of James Marsh {{as a catalyst for}} the Concord Transcendentalist movement. The standard narrative suggests that the Congregationalist Marsh naively imported Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Aids to Reflection (Am. ed. 1829) hoping to revivify orthodoxy in America. By providing a “Preliminary Essay” to explain Coleridge’s abstruse theology, Marsh injected Coleridge’s hijacked Kantian epistemology—with its distinction between Reason and Understanding—into American discourse. This epistemology inspired Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bronson Alcott, and it helped spark the Transcendentalists’ largely post-Christian religious convictions. This article provides a re-evaluation of Marsh’s philosophical theology by attending to <b>the</b> <b>precise</b> historical <b>moment</b> that Marsh chose to publish the Aids to Reflection and his “Preliminary Essay. ” By the late 1820 s, the philosophical problem of free will lurked in American religious discourse—Unitarian as well as Trinitarian—and Marsh sought to exploit the problem as a way to explain how aspects of Trinitarian Christianity might be rational and yet unexplainable. Attending carefully to the numerous philosophical and religious discourses of the moment—including Unitarianism, Trinitarianism, Kant, Coleridge, and Scottish Common Sense—and providing close readings of the historical philosophers Marsh engaged, this article shows how James Marsh laid the epistemological groundwork for a new romanticized Christianity that was distinct from the Concord Transcendentalists, but nonetheless part of its historical lineage...|$|R
