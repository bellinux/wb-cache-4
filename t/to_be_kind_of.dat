They've just changed {{something}} important in their lives forever." [...] When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: [...] Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound. According to Boon, during the MK games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only [...] "korrect it" [...] when one of the developers points out they should do it.|$|E

500|$|In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals {{acquired}} Rexar {{and began}} promoting Obetrol {{as a treatment}} for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase [...] "A.D.D. for All" [...] intended to convey that [...] "it was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an inclusive thing" [...] for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of [...] "the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD Act". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution {{of a large number of}} issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product. In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction.|$|E

I haven't ever said right out who it was about, but it's about the big relationship I was in, and the whole breakup, which was really long. The breaking up and the hard stuff in our relationship happened sort of after I was out of the spotlight for a while and writing. It wasn't in any way public. I was trying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> discreet about it, and then he totally came out and {{said he was going}} to rehab. It was shocking to me.

2500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{found that}} Ms. Kelly [...] "sounds like an album where Rowland is mostly sorting through some deeply {{personal}} relationship issues {{with a couple}} relatively lighthearted songs thrown in for variety." [...] He noted that [...] "all-around, the album does provide a stronger set of songs than 2002's Simply Deep. The material tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> insidious, rather than hitting you immediately or going through one ear and out the other." [...] Giving the album three stars out of five, he also remarked that [...] "the lyrics [...] are direct and specific, going beyond basic breakup material." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani stated that, [...] "this time around, both the production and lyrics are stronger." [...] He praised the [...] "bona fide club jams" [...] on the album. Billboard wrote that while [...] "Rowland may never upstage her superstar groupmate Beyonce, but she certainly has the vocal chops and charm to stand on her own stiletto-clad feet. Compared with her gospel-fueled 2002 solo debut, Rowland appears confident and dominant on foot-stompers [...] though still short of career-defining, Ms. Kelly finds its author opening up more while welcoming the possibility that destiny may just find another star.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds. However, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends but can be performed acoustically. Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album {{to have a little}} bit more of a live feel to it, with a little more live instrumentation." [...] In February 2011, talking about her third studio album [...] "Glassheart", Lewis said that the album would be more experimental than Spirit and Echo by embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a different sound – but still classic". Lewis described it as [...] "energetic, deep, [...] unique". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics".|$|E

In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, {{there has to be some}} sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not going to lie to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E

Lewis suggested the album would be [...] "a bit different from what people have heard" [...] from her before, adding that she planned to [...] "go in and create and just see what happens". Lewis later described the album as [...] "more progressive", [...] "more eclectic", [...] "more uptempo" [...] and [...] "a bit darker". The Sun reported that the album had taken a dubstep direction, with songwriters asked to submit dance songs and no ballads. The song [...] "Come Alive" [...] experiments with dubstep and drum and bass. Lewis stated that the song {{was inspired by the}} [...] "dirty and heavy" [...] music sound of British electronica band Faithless. She also commented, [...] "We wanted to do an uptempo song, but for it to remain true to what I do". In March 2012, after extending the album's recording sessions, Lewis elaborated on the evolution of her sound, [...] "I've got a track that's got a bit of drum 'n' bass at the end. It's quite different to what I've had out before." [...] Lewis then went on to add [...] "I've got a track that's very '90s. It's just different influences that I've had through my life growing up. I'm really actually looking forward to people hearing it." ...|$|E
