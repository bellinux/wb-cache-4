5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E

5|$|Butterflies {{are widely}} used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, {{embedded}} in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.

5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young for the role. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> the Dove.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral {{vertebrates}} {{have evolved}} into the front flippers of whales, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> birds, the running forelegs of dogs, deer, and horses, the short forelegs of frogs and lizards, and the grasping hands of primates including humans. The same major forearm bones (humerus, radius, and ulna) are found in fossils of lobe-finned fish such as Eusthenopteron.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> dragonflies are {{generally}} clear, {{apart from the}} dark veins and pterostigmata. In the chasers (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (Brachythemis) have brown bands on all four wings, while some scarlets (Crocothemis) and dropwings (Trithemis) have bright orange patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker (Aeshna grandis) have translucent, pale yellow wings.|$|E
5|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is {{an emerging}} disease in North American bats which by 2012 {{was associated with}} at least 5-7 million bat deaths. The condition is named for a distinctive fungal growth around the muzzles and on <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> hibernating bats and was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in Schoharie County, New York.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E

5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the P-16 were later used {{in the development of}} the successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|Commerce, {{represented}} on the left side, is depicted by a shopkeeper wearing a hat with <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> Hermes, the Greek god of commerce (or, according to some sources, Mercury, the Roman god of commerce). The business owner is bearded and wears a crocus flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the caduceus, the staff carried by Hermes Trismegistus in Egyptian mythology and Hermes in Greek mythology. In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack PLUS is a two-disc soundtrack album {{containing}} mostly previously unreleased music. The {{music on}} the first disc was composed by Naoshi Mizuta and comes from <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> the Goddess expansion, the three add-on scenarios and the Abyssea trilogy. The second disc contains the background tracks of the PlayOnline Viewer composed by Noriko Matsueda and Kumi Tanioka of which only two had been previously released {{as part of the}} Memories of Dusk and Dawn compilation. The soundtrack was released on November 9, 2011 by Square Enix with the catalog numbers SQEX-10284-5 and spans a duration of 2:15:40 over 40 tracks.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. <b>The</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the Muslim army, which would then either be driven away from the {{battlefield}} or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|Later, more {{specific}} similarities were discovered: for example, the Distal-less gene {{was found in}} 1989 {{to be involved in}} the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of sea urchins. It was evident that the gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.|$|E
