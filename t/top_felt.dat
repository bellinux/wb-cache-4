50|$|Above the cymbal is a <b>top</b> <b>felt,</b> above {{which may}} be a flat washer but this is {{sometimes}} omitted to allow looser mounting of the cymbal, and last a wingnut or cymbal nut.|$|E
5000|$|Piggybacking is {{a method}} of {{mounting}} a splash cymbal, mostly restricted to small splashes, by simply placing it inverted above another cymbal, with which it shares the mounting bolt and its sheath, washers if used and wingnut. A spacing felt is normally used to separate the cymbals, serving as the <b>top</b> <b>felt</b> of the lower cymbal and the bottom felt of the upper cymbal.|$|E

5000|$|A bashlyk, also spelled Bashlik (Shkharkhon, Başlıq, Başlıq, Turkish: Başlık; [...] "baş" [...] - head, [...] "-lıq" [...] (Tatar) / [...] "-lık" [...] (Turkish) - {{derivative}} suffix), is {{a traditional}} Circassian, Turkic and Cossack cone-shaped headdress hood, usually of leather, felt or wool, an ancient round <b>topped</b> <b>felt</b> bonnet with lappets for wrapping around the neck. Local versions of determine the trim, which may consist of decorative cords, embroidery. metallized strings, fur balls or tassels. Among dozens of versions are winter bashlyks worn atop regular headdress, cotton bashlyks, homeknitted bashlyks, silk bashlyks, scarf bashlyks, down bashlyks, dress bashlyks, jumpsuit-type bashlyks, etc. Bashlyks are used as traditional folk garment, and as uniform headdress.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} commercially {{available}} variations on this basic pattern, involving for example springs for looser suspension, hemispherical rubber washers for tighter suspension, or quick-release mechanisms {{in place of}} the nut. Some drummers replace the dome washer with a wooden washer or even a spherical or hemispherical wooden bead, with or without a bottom felt, to increase the sustain of the cymbal. The <b>top</b> <b>felt</b> may even be omitted for heavier cymbals mounted close to horizontal, also to increase sustain.|$|E
50|$|On February 10, 1973, {{during a}} {{cleaning}} operation, 42 workers were {{inside one of}} the TETCo natural gas tanks which had supposedly been completely drained ten months earlier. However, ignition occurred, causing a plume of combusting gas to rise within the tank. Two workers near the <b>top</b> <b>felt</b> the heat and rushed to the safety of scaffolding outside. The other forty workers were not so fortunate. They all died as the concrete cap on the tank rose 20-30 feet in the air and then came crashing back down, crushing them to death.|$|E

2500|$|The Yankees' owners at the time, Del Webb and Dan <b>Topping,</b> <b>felt</b> that Power's playing {{style and}} {{personality}} wasn't {{suited for the}} conservative style that they wanted a [...] "black" [...] player to represent {{as a member of}} the club. Power dated light-skinned women, leading George Weiss, the general manager of the Yankees, to say that Power was [...] "not the Yankee type". The Yankees also had Johnny Mize at first base, and another top prospect, Bill Skowron, in their farm system. Skowron spent most of the 1953 season at first base, while Power played 121 games in the outfield. When the Yankees had a need at the major leagues, they promoted Gus Triandos, a Caucasian player from Class AA, instead of Power. The Yankees decided on Elston Howard to become the first black player in club history. Many blacks and Puerto Ricans protested in front of Yankee Stadium in response to what they believed to have been a racially motivated decision.|$|R

When Uncle Richard heard what had happened, he turned very pale, and murmured, [...] "Thank God!" [...] Aunt Kate got me out of my wet clothes as quickly as possible, put me away to bed in hot {{blankets}} and dosed me with ginger tea. I slept like a <b>top</b> and <b>felt</b> none the worse for my experience the next morning.|$|R

60|$|They {{had taken}} each other's hands, half {{laughing}} and quite ritually; {{and before they}} could disconnect again Michael spun them all round, like a demon spinning {{the world for a}} <b>top.</b> Diana <b>felt,</b> as the circle of the horizon flew instantaneously around her, a far aerial sense of the ring of heights beyond London and corners where she had climbed as a child; she seemed almost to hear the rooks cawing about the old pines on Highgate, or to see the glowworms gathering and kindling in the woods of Box Hill.|$|R
50|$|Many {{players had}} become {{full-time}} professionals during darts' peak {{years in the}} 1980s, and the big sudden drop {{in the amount of}} darts television coverage in 1989 left them with very little prize money to play for. It also meant a lack of exposure, which would make it very tough for them to make a living from exhibition matches. The <b>top</b> players <b>felt</b> that not enough was being done by the BDO to encourage new sponsors into their sport and television coverage should be greater than just one event per year.|$|R
5000|$|A massive fore {{control tower}} was, {{for the first}} time, fitted with an {{internal}} lift and topped by three conductors (numbered n°1, 2, and A from top down), which were mounted on the same axis. The accumulation of heavy weight (85 tons) so {{high up in the}} <b>top</b> was <b>felt</b> to be noteworthy. When Dunkerque [...] was torpedoed at Mers-el-Kébir on 6 July 6, 1940 this proved to be a shortcoming, as the main fire control directors were unseated from their ball races because of the [...] "whiplash" [...] effect on the mast around which they were mounted.|$|R
5000|$|GM {{approved}} {{production of}} the vehicle if the design could be transferred to its standard model, because <b>top</b> GM brass <b>felt</b> that they could sell more models if it were attached to the popular Bel Air model.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Walker and Mary joined the Fringe dwellers {{that lived in}} the Adelaide Park Lands. In 1892 Mary died and Ada Niledalli became his companion. Photographs show him as a thick set man with bushy hair, a full white [...] "flour bag" [...] beard and grey <b>felt</b> <b>top</b> hat, wearing a ragged jacket or tail-coat, and barefooted.|$|R
50|$|Roll roofing is a bitumen {{product that}} is exposed to the weather. To protect the base from {{ultraviolet}} degradation mineral granules are added on <b>top</b> of the <b>felt,</b> also decreasing the product's fire vulnerability. Thin, transparent film {{is added to the}} base of the felt during manufacturing on all torch-on products. This stops the felt from sticking to itself when rolled up during the packaging process.|$|R
60|$|Wildeve {{gave her}} {{his arm and}} took {{her down on the}} outside of the ring to the bottom of the dance, which they entered. In two minutes more they were {{involved}} in the figure and began working their way upwards to the top. Till they had advanced halfway thither Eustacia wished more than once that she had not yielded to his request; from the middle to the <b>top</b> she <b>felt</b> that, since she had come out to seek pleasure, she was only doing a natural thing to obtain it. Fairly launched into the ceaseless glides and whirls which their new position as top couple opened up to them, Eustacia's pulses began to move too quickly for long rumination of any kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{have had}} a table rise at least twenty inches from {{the floor in the}} full light, with no one present but the medium and myself, and while our finger-tips alone touched the <b>top.</b> It <b>felt</b> as if it were {{floating}} in a thick and resilient liquid, and when I pressed upon it, it oscillated, in a curious way, as if the power were applied from below and in the centre of the table. The psychic was a young girl, and I am certain played no trick. I could see her feet on the floor, and her finger-tips were, like mine, {{on the top of the}} table. This was the clearest test of levitation I ever had, but the lifting of a pencil in independent writing is the same thing in effect." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I'd {{been told}} that my whole life, but at this {{critical}} juncture, with my career taking off, I didn't have the wherewithal to argue. [...] We [...] shared a house and spent weeks exercising [...] [...] I was as motivated as ever {{to come out on}} <b>top.</b> [...] I <b>felt</b> good when it was over. I enjoed the compliments about my [...] "new" [...] shape. I shot the video and did in fact reshape my image." ...|$|R
5000|$|The top riders had {{a meeting}} and decided they wanted a {{practice}} session before restarting in the wet, but the request was refused by the race organizers and the riders decided to boycott the race. Eddie Lawson says, [...] "This place is unique in that the track surface is very, very slippery, and when it has water on it you can’t ride on it. All the <b>top</b> riders <b>felt</b> it was too dangerous, and it is, and so we didn’t ride. It’s as simple as that. … We go to plenty of racetracks where we test all week, in the sunshine, and then it starts to rain; well, we put rain tires on and we race. This place, you can’t do that. Regardless of not testing or anything else, you just can’t ride in the wet, it’s just too dangerous. It was unfortunate." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Can't Stop" [...] has a {{high pitched}} {{keyboard}} sound embedded in between {{the sound of a}} drum machine and clarinet. The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that [...] "I want my man and I am going to get him whatever". Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the <b>top.</b> He <b>felt</b> that [...] "Can't Stop", at 4:45 length, was {{a good example of the}} division of Madonna's songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book , described Faure's song [...] "24 Hours" [...] as a slow track which fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson's [...] "Turn it Up" [...] as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.|$|R
60|$|She {{could just}} see {{his face in the}} glimmer that {{filtered}} from the skylight at the <b>top.</b> And she <b>felt</b> that he was learning her, learning all that she had to give him, learning the trust that was shining through her eyes. There was just enough light for them to realize the old house watching from below and from above--a glint on the dark floor there, on the dark wall here; a blackness that seemed to be inhabited by some spirit, so that their hands clutched and twitched, when the tiny, tiny noises of Time, playing in wood and stone, clicked out.|$|R
50|$|A silk top hat is {{made from}} hatters' plush, a soft silk weave with a very long, defined nap. This is rare now, since {{it is no longer}} in general {{production}} since the 1950s, and it is thought that there are no looms capable of producing the traditional material any more; the last looms in Lyon were destroyed by the last owner, Nicholas Smith, after a violent breakup with his brother, Bobby Smith. The standard covering is now fur plush or melusine as (the London hat merchant) Christys' calls it. A grey flat fur <b>felt</b> <b>top</b> hat is the popular alternative.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hommage à Néguev (To Neguev)" [...] (marble / 3.7m x 1.7 x 0.6 / 1962 / Mitzpe Ramon, Israel, Symposium) {{performed}} {{on the occasion of}} a Symposium in Israel. About this experience, the artist expresses himself in these words: It was a real brainwashing life for two months in the Negev desert. I felt my sculpture as a drop in the sea with immensity of nature. This {{is the first time that}} I could hold chisel with sincerely humble. When I made an elliptical hole in the <b>top</b> part, I <b>felt</b> that sun light was rising towards me.|$|R
500|$|The musical {{sequence}} of [...] "Jame Raho" [...] establishes {{the characters of}} the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an [...] "ideal son" [...] who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he {{is different from the}} rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of [...] "Maa" [...] were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the <b>top</b> and <b>felt</b> it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.|$|R
5000|$|The {{passage of}} Bill 50 was {{controversial}} with Hydro-Québec's <b>top</b> executives, who <b>felt</b> the {{government tried to}} bypass the powerful utility. [...] As the party picking up the bill, Hydro wanted control over {{the development of the}} hydroelectric project. Commissioner Robert A. Boyd, who was slated as the top Hydro-Québec executive and Nadeau's right-hand man at the SEBJ, first declined the appointment, explaining that with no background in public works, Nadeau would have little credibility with the engineers running the operations. Conflict soon erupted between Hydro-Québec and Nadeau, who left {{less than a year after}} his appointment. He was replaced by Boyd, who kept informed of the latest development on the project by consulting with colleagues on the board on a daily basis.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Fort Ontario, many were surprised, scared, and angered {{to see that}} the fort was surrounded in barbed-wire <b>topped</b> fences. They <b>felt</b> that they had left Europe expecting to be brought to safety and freedom but had instead been brought to another concentration camp. It was only after explanations from staff at the fort that the refugees began to accept the fence. However, {{there was a lack of}} freedom in the camp. For the first month, the refugees were not allowed to leave the camp. Even relatives who had traveled to Oswego were not allowed to enter the camp, and they had to visit with their relatives through the chain-link fence. Some local citizens visited the camp to welcome the newcomers, passing sweets and gifts through the fence.|$|R
5000|$|Luaka Bop Records repackaged {{the first}} Crammed Discs release for American {{listeners}} in 1993 as Adventures in Afropea 1. By {{the end of}} the year, Billboard announced it was the top seller for [...] "world music." [...] Zap Mama went on tour playing New York's Central Park, Paris' Olympia, the Jazz-festival of Montreux. After the success of Adventures in Afropea 1, Daulne said the record company [...] "wanted to mould us into a poppy girl band, but I said, 'No, you'll kill me', and I stopped. Everyone was asking why I wanted to stop when we'd finally arrived at the <b>top.</b> But I <b>felt</b> that it was completely wrong. I wasn't ready. I wasn't strong enough. The manager said that if I stopped then, I'd be killing my career, but it was my decision." ...|$|R

50|$|Founded in 1972, the PLC {{began as}} a {{conversation}} between William A. Douglas, Dean of Admissions, and then Assistant Director of Admissions, Terry Heineman.  Heineman had attended the University of Oklahoma where he was involved with an undergraduate program similar to what PLC eventually became.  After many discussions, Heineman and Douglas thought it worthwhile to initiate a similar leadership program at CU Boulder as a recruitment strategy {{to attract and retain}} Colorado’s <b>top</b> students.  Both <b>felt</b> it important to involve the outstanding leaders in the state to lend additional credibility to their concept.  This inclination led them to William Coors, Chairman of the Coors Corporation.  These three, along with several other corporate and community leaders, moved forward and developed the Presidents Leadership Class, named in honor of the university president and the corporate presidents involved in the program’s formation.|$|R

5000|$|The re-animated head of Nostradamus {{is cause}} for scorn, both from actors and critics. Hutton said in an {{interview}} that he and the other actors 'felt stupid talking to the head - we would almost break up! The actor was underneath the table, with his head stuck up through a hole in the table <b>top,</b> and you <b>felt</b> like a damn fool talking to him'. Warren writes that 'as Nostradamus, Michael Golden has little to do except poke his head through a hole in the table and talk' and even then 'many of the shots of the prophet's head are of a dummy cranium, obviously not Golden'. The topics the actors discuss with the head are regarded as dubious, as well, with Hardy saying that 'the highpoint of the film ... is an extended debate between Coulouris and Nostradamus' head in which the pair harangue each other, Nostradamus finding the purpose for which he's been re-animated too petty'.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must know, monsieur," [...] {{he would}} say, [...] "that I left Egypt after Kleber's assassination. I would gladly have stayed on, for I {{was engaged in}} a {{translation}} of the Koran, and between ourselves I had thoughts {{at the time of}} embracing Mahometanism, for I was deeply struck by the wisdom of their views about marriage. They had made an incredible mistake, however, upon the subject of wine, and this was what the Mufti who attempted to convert me could never get over. Then when old Kleber died and Menou came to the <b>top,</b> I <b>felt</b> {{that it was time for}} me to go. It is not for me to speak of my own capacities, monsieur, but you will readily understand that the man does not care to be ridden by the mule. I carried my Koran and my papers to London, where Monsieur Otto had been sent by the First Consul to arrange a treaty of peace; for both nations were very weary of the war, which had already lasted ten years. Here I was most useful to Monsieur Otto on account of my knowledge of the English tongue, and also, if I may say so, on account of my natural capacity. They were happy days during which I lived in the square of Bloomsbury. The climate of monsieur's country is, it must be confessed, detestable. But then what would you have? Flowers grow best in the rain. One has but to point to monsieur's fellow country-women to prove it.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by biomimicry, {{specifically}} by the octopus 2 ̆ 7 curious nature, I treated {{my interest}} in the organism as a jumping off point to create the senior collection. I searched {{for the existence of}} the octopus 2 ̆ 7 essence in other organisms and incorporated what I found into my collection. To create fluidity and volume within this first look, the top was composed of silk organza and features smooth stomach darts, similar to the lines of a corset, that release into a full bust. The pants, fitted at the waistline, are a solid color with a sweetheart cut to mimic the shape and starkness of a bud against its tissue petals. In addition, hand applied ruffles of navy, plum, and red silk organza were attached to the fullness of the <b>top.</b> Then, hand <b>felting</b> and silk iridescent chiffon were used to create depth between layers. The fabric choice allows for a delicate wavering on the wearer as they walk, and the hand placed process controls leading lines, moving the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s eye into the depths of their swirls...|$|R
