5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
40|$|The {{feminine}} character, {{shaped by}} nurturing experience, includes fundamental spiritual training. Feminist spiritual writers value nurturant other-oriented personality characteristics. Although not necessarily having fulfilled nurturing social roles, men may develop spiritually advanced characteristics by undergoing experiences Christ recommended. Examining four spiritual figures, this {{study sought to}} ascertain whether exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> recommended by feminists and by Christ facilitates development of spiritually advanced characteristics. The findings did not demonstrate that exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> recommended by feminists facilitated this development. Nor did exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> recommended by Christ predict this development. Females did not develop spiritually advanced characteristics to a higher degree than males. Exposure {{to a combination of}} <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> recommended by Christ and by feminists did correlate with development of spiritually advanced characteristics. Exposure to a modicum of <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> recommended by feminists may be necessary. Recommendations for counselors are included...|$|R

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience.</b> Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses {{on the way in}} which the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, {{there was considerable}} concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E

5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation {{for this}} new storyline was keeping the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of the}} story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience.</b> Among his cited reference points for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important factor. As part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed not to be a perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into her line of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E
5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
