2500|$|In {{addition}} to its demand for a two-round system, the opposition sought {{a decrease in the}} deposit that candidates were required to pay; the amount was equivalent to about 44,000 dollars. Another opposition demand was the revision of the voter rolls. On 25 January 2010, six opposition candidates and <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> <b>called</b> for a resumption of the revision of the voter rolls as well as a delay of the election; they also argued that Gnassingbé was conducting an unofficial campaign {{before the start of the}} campaign period. Government Spokesman Pascal Bodjona dismissed the opposition concerns; he said that the voter rolls had been established prior to the 2007 parliamentary election and that it was up to CENI to decide whether to resume revising them. Regarding Gnassingbé's alleged unofficial campaigning, Bodjona argued that Gnassingbé, as President, was merely working for the people: [...] "he will not starve the people because of the electoral process". Bodjona additionally argued that the opposition only wanted a delay because they were unprepared for the election.|$|R

Ward claimed to have conducted a string of bombings in Britain in 1973 and 1974 and to have married and had a baby with two separate IRA members. Despite her retraction of these claims, the lack of any corroborating evidence against her, and serious gaps in her testimony– which was frequently rambling, incoherent and [...] "improbable"– she was wrongfully convicted in November 1974.

2500|$|Before {{construction}} {{there were}} concerns that during construction the sea bed would be disturbed, dislodging World War II-era naval mines and toxic materials including mines, chemical waste, chemical munitions {{and other items}} dumped in the Baltic Sea in the past decades, and thereby toxic substances could surface from the seabed damaging the Baltic's particularly sensitive ecosystem. [...] Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren demanded that the environmental analysis should include alternative ways of taking the pipeline across the Baltic, as the pipeline is projected to be passing through areas considered environmentally problematic and risky. [...] Sweden's <b>three</b> opposition <b>parties</b> <b>called</b> for {{an examination of the}} possibility of rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Finnish environmental groups campaigned to consider the more southern route, claiming that the sea bed is flatter and so construction would be more straightforward, and therefore potentially less disruptive to waste, including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, littered on the sea bed. [...] Latvian president Valdis Zatlers said that Nord Stream was environmentally hazardous as, unlike the North Sea, there is no such water circulation in the Baltic Sea. [...] Ene Ergma, Speaker of the Riigikogu (Parliament of Estonia), warned that the pipeline work rips a canal in the seabed which will demand leveling the sand that lies along the way, atomizing volcanic formations and disposing of fill along the bottom of the sea, altering sea currents.|$|R
50|$|By 2008, the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> {{were all}} {{in a state of}} decline. While SPS had {{achieved}} 8.7% of votes in the 1999 Duma election, in the 2007 election it only received 0.96%. Support for the Democratic Party (0.13%) and Civilian Power (1.05%) in the 2007 election was also low. SPS—highly critical of Vladimir Putin and United Russia in its 2007 election campaign—was losing voters because Putin had adopted many of the market reforms championed by SPS, and also because companies started to withdraw their financial support from the party. With falling support and votes being lost to United Russia, the <b>three</b> <b>parties,</b> among others, considered mergers in order to survive. The decision to initiate the merger was made in October 2008, and in November the unification was completed. The new <b>party,</b> <b>called</b> Right Cause, was officially registered on 18 February 2009. The party's creation was supported by the presidential administration of Dmitry Medvedev.|$|R

The Coordinadora’s abstentionism was publicly supported by the US government, which hoped to challenge the legitimacy of the November elections by alleging that opposition sectors were not able to participate.
