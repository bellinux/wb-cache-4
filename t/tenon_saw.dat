5000|$|Backsaws {{include the}} <b>tenon</b> <b>saw,</b> the {{dovetail}} saw, and the (United Kingdom) sash saw1. Tenon and dovetail saws {{usually have a}} pistol grip style handle which may be open or closed at the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|Sash saw [...] - [...] {{name that}} seems to have been used in the 18th and 19th century for a smaller <b>tenon</b> <b>saw,</b> used in {{fabricating}} window sashes. The term is also used currently to refer to a thin, flexible saw used to free sashes that have been painted shut.|$|E
5000|$|... "Back saws," [...] {{so called}} {{because they have}} a thinner blade backed with steel or brass to {{maintain}} rigidity, are a subset of hand saws. Back saws have different names depending on the length of the blade; <b>tenon</b> <b>saw</b> is often used as a generic name for all the sizes of woodworking backsaw. Some examples are: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tenon</b> <b>saw</b> [...] - [...] a midsized backsaw. The saw derives {{its name}} from its use in the cutting of tenons for mortise and tenon joinery. Tenon saws are {{commonly}} available with rip-filed teeth for rip cutting and cross-cut for cutting across the grain. Teeth are relatively fine, with 13 teeth per inch being a common size for the saw.|$|E
5000|$|In {{woodworking}} and carpentry, hand saws, {{also known}} as [...] "panel saws", [...] "fish saws", are used to cut pieces of wood into different shapes. This is usually done in order to join the pieces together and carve a wooden object. They usually operate by having a series of sharp points of some substance that is harder than the wood being cut. The hand saw {{is a bit like}} a <b>tenon</b> <b>saw,</b> but with one flat, sharp edge.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth <b>tenon</b> <b>saw</b> is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|E
40|$|Un-moderated use of {{technology}} may lead to self-destruction. Exploration and generation of artifacts developed under the umbrella title 'Embedded Narrative'. Question formulated in this instance related {{to the problem of}} symbolizing the possible relationship /consequences of man made activity to global warming and climate change. The objective was the visual manipulation of artifacts to raise awareness of the latent danger in unreflective use of powerful technologies. Simple tools (in this instance hammer and <b>tenon</b> <b>saw,</b> symbolic {{of technology}} in general) were rendered useless by turning their very uses against themselves. This strategy creating in turn a visual paradox and a dystopic depiction of the law of unintended consequences. The artifacts project a resonant poetic conundrum and a meditation on hubris...|$|E
