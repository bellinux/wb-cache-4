5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> base camp.|$|E
5|$|During {{a council}} of war, {{the command of}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army was {{transferred}} to Khalid by Abu Ubaidah, Commander in Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army.|$|E
5|$|Qanatir led two {{armies of}} Slavs against <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> right wing and right centre with some {{assistance}} from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah. <b>The</b> <b>Muslim</b> right wing and right center again fell back.|$|E
50|$|This was {{a signal}} for <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> to attack, each of <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> killed <b>the</b> Jews on the camels in front of them, one behind <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> killed all <b>the</b> Jews, except one who escaped.|$|R
50|$|This {{position}} {{was to the}} advantage of <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> as <b>the</b> Copts were the natives of the land of Egypt and both the Byzantines and <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> were strangers. Though some Copts from personal considerations continued to support the Byzantines, the sympathies of the Copts were now, by and large, with <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> <b>The</b> Copts were not supposed to fight against the Byzantines on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> but they undertook to help <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> in <b>the</b> promotion of war effort and in the provision of stores, build roads and bridges for them, and provide them moral support.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Muslim</b> force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. Protecting the flanks of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp, and thus <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Muslim</b> {{right wing}} {{infantry}} now attacked the Byzantine left center at its left flank while <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> right center attacked from front.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Muslim</b> siege {{forces had}} been {{weakened}} by the withdrawal of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force. If the Byzantine garrison had sallied out against <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army, historians suspect the defenders would have broken through <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> lines and lifted the siege. Understanding {{the danger of the}} situation, Khalid hurriedly returned to Damascus.|$|E
50|$|Consequences of {{the conquest}} of Bosra were: {{the conquest of}} Bosra in {{the second week of}} July 634 was the first {{important}} victory gained by <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> in Syria. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> lost 130 men in the battle, while the Byzantines suffered several thousand casualties.

50|$|The tribe was {{attacked}} and taken by surprise. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> managed {{to kill a}} large number of the enemy soldiers and captured a great deal of booty.

5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{remained}} a close {{ally of the}} Byzantine Empire. He fought against Mleh, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, assisting in the restoration of Byzantine rule in the Cilician plain. He also made alliances with <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> rulers of Aleppo and Damascus against Saladin, who had begun to unite <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> countries along {{the borders of the}} crusader states. Since Bohemond repudiated his second wife and married an Antiochene lady, Patriarch Aimery excommunicated him in 1180.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the fall}} of Alexandria <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> were <b>the</b> masters of Egypt. At {{the time of their}} Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of the country. When Alexandria was {{captured}} by <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> <b>the</b> houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, [...] "the queen of cities". 'Amr wished for Alexandria to remain <b>the</b> capital of <b>Muslim</b> Egypt. He wrote to Caliph 'Umar seeking his permission to do this. 'Umar rejected the proposal on the basis that Alexandria was a maritime city and there would always be a danger of Byzantine naval attacks.|$|R
50|$|According to <b>Muslim</b> sources, <b>the</b> {{inhabitants}} then regrouped {{and chased}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> {{but because of}} flooding in <b>the</b> area, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> managed to escape.|$|R

5|$|From Jabiya, on Khalid’s suggestion, Abu Ubaidah ordered <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army to {{withdraw}} to the plain of the Yarmouk River, {{which had a}} good supply of pasture and water and where cavalry could be used more effectively. Abu Ubaidah, in a council of war, transferred the supreme command of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> forces to Khalid, who acted as a field commander in the battle and was the mastermind of the annihilation of the Byzantine army.|$|E
5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army, which would then either be driven away from the {{battlefield}} or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.|$|E
50|$|At Bir Maunah, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> sent a {{messenger}} (Haram bin Milhan) {{with a letter}} of Muhammad to Amir bin Tufayl, the cousin of Abu Bara and the chief of Banu Amir. Amir did not read the Message but rather ordered a man to spear Haram bin Milhan in the back. Amir bin Tufayl then requested the Banu Amir people to help him fight <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> They refused to his request, as they were reluctant to betray the promise of safety by Abu Bara to <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> So, Amir bin Tufayl took the help of Banu Sulaym against <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Together, they attacked <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> fought back, but in the end, {{all of them were}} killed except for Ka‘b bin Zaid bin An-Najjar who was carried wounded from among the dead. He later died in the Battle of the Trench.|$|R
5000|$|As 'Amr {{surveyed}} the military situation, {{he felt that}} Alexandria would be a hard nut to crack. [...] The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria, and they were determined to offer stiff resistance to <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> They mounted catapults {{on the walls of}} the city, and these engines pounded <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> with boulders. This caused considerable damage to <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> and 'Amr ordered his men back from the advance position so that they might be beyond the range of the missiles. A see-saw war followed. When <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> tried to go close to the city they were hit with missiles. When the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b>|$|R

5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> armies would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war {{he suggested that}} Abu Ubaidah draw all <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a coup in Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} {{power in the}} hands of a junta.

Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised as legitimate by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E

50|$|Nawab M. Ismail Khan entered {{politics}} {{at a very}} early age.

5|$|Meanwhile, Heraclius had {{concentrated}} a large army at Antioch to {{roll back}} Syria. Khalid got the news from Roman prisoners in Northern Syria.

Five massive armies were launched in Syria from different routes in June 636 to recapture it.|$|E

50|$|In India’s pre-independence era, when <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> in India demanded fair {{representation}} in power-sharing with the British government {{along with the}} Hindus in 1906, the British government provided for a separate electorate system for <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> in Government of India Act 1909. As a result, of the total 250 seats of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, 117 seats were kept reserved for <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Accordingly, <b>the</b> general elections of 1937 were held {{on the basis of}} the extended separate electorates, where only <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> voted for <b>the</b> 117 seats, in Bengal.|$|R
50|$|As Muslim power waned {{with the}} gradual {{demise of the}} Mughal Empire, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> of India faced a new challenge, that of {{protecting}} their own culture and interests, yet interacting with an alien, technologically advantaged power.
