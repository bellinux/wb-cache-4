5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> (One World Trade Center) {{began in}} August 1966; {{extensive}} use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process. The first tenants moved into <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> in December 1970.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>tower,</b> {{and the west}} face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> and {{the south}} tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a {{resemblance}} to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E

5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties in {{accurately}} locating Flight 11 {{caused a}} delay of five minutes, to 8:43am, before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> at 8:46, the two jets were still readying for flight {{and did not}} take off until 8:52am.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time. Countless {{people in the}} streets of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E

5|$|Three {{buildings}} in the World Trade Center collapsed due to fire-induced structural failure. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59a.m. after burning for 56minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity, and 7WTC collapsed at 5:21p.m. The {{west side of the}} Pentagon sustained significant damage.|$|E

500|$|The {{neighborhood}} where <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> were built was a rural, unnamed section of Flushing, {{part of a}} [...] land grant to Massachusetts settlers. [...] In 1923, the Glen Oaks Golf Club was built, created on [...] purchased from William K. Vanderbilt II's country estate. [...] By 1971, the golf course was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> were constructed in Glen Oaks because of Queens's lax zoning rules, which are less restrictive than those in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island. Some Glen Oaks residents, mostly single-home dwellers, protested the construction of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Shore <b>Towers</b> {{because they were afraid}} it would dominate the horizon.

5|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the {{existing}} building is part of <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>tower,</b> which {{was built in the}} late 14th century. The north aisle, together with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam roof, was added about 1450. The carved stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.|$|E
5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower,</b> 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>tower</b> was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After the crash, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower</b> burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower,</b> South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th floors of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Tower,</b> lost 658 employees, {{considerably more than}} any other employer.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
