5|$|Episode {{director}} Neil Affleck {{was praised}} {{by the staff}} for his directing in this episode. In the scene where Chief Wiggum falls {{on his back in}} his bedroom, unable to roll over or get back up, Affleck decided <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> the scene for the staff to showcase how Affleck envisioned Chief Wiggum's predicament. Affleck was also praised for his ability to create three new elaborate settings in the episode: the science museum, the Springfield penitentiary, and the large toy store.|$|E
5|$|The view of Jinnah in the West {{has been}} shaped to some extent by his {{portrayal}} in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.|$|E
5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E

It's simply {{a group of people}} passionate about acting, who meet every other week in Karachi <b>to</b> spontaneously <b>act</b> <b>out.</b> The act-ups or act-olutions (like {{revolutions}} of The Acting Wheel) consist of giving out scripts to participants and enabling them <b>to</b> spontaneously <b>act</b> <b>out</b> the scripts creatively. Participants also play acting games frequently, including improv and comedy. The blog talks about each act-up http://theactingwheel.blogspot.com ...|$|R

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

25|$|The play is also full of {{constraint}} imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, {{and himself}} as {{being caught in}} birdlime. He mocks the ability of man to bring about his own ends, and points out that some divine force molds men's aims into something other than what they intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> his revenge.|$|E
50|$|Miller and Dollard (1941) pioneered social {{learning}} theory by their findings that individuals do not need <b>to</b> personally <b>act</b> <b>out</b> a behavior <b>to</b> learn it; they can learn from observation.

25|$|Early on, some Hitler pathographies took {{not only}} psychological, but also {{historical}} and sociological aspects into account. This interdisciplinary approach {{had been developed}} by the psychiatrist Wilhelm Lange-Eichbaum back in 1928. The earliest socio-psychological pathography of Hitler appeared in 1948 in Gustav Bychowski anthology Dictators and Disciples. In this volume, Bychowski, a Polish-American psychiatrist, compared several historical figures who have successfully carried out a coup d’etat: Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Robespierre, Hitler and Josef Stalin. He {{came to the conclusion}} that all of these men had an abundance of traits that must by classified as “psychopathic” such as the tendency <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> impulses or to project their own hostile impulses onto other people or groups.|$|E

His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, where no one would know them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to also intervene, because of his involvement in Vito's death. Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult. Vito Jr. continued <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> and later defecated in a shower at school.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Elana Maryles Sztokman, in {{her book}} The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish men in an Egalitarian World {{conducted}} research into the identities and tensions among men who belong to partnership minyans. She found that many Orthodox Jewish men choose to attend these settings due to dissatisfaction with {{the ways in which}} Orthodoxy socializes men into constructs of masculinites. Orthodoxy, according to the research, constructs a masculinity that is rooted in obedience, unquestioning performance, emotionlessless, conformity, and elitism. Men who attend partnership minyans are often disillusioned from those constructs and seek a space where they are welcome to think and act for themselves, to be warm and inclusive, to challenge socially-accepted conventions within Orthodox synagogues, and <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> a less exclusively-cerebral and more humanely emotional-spiritual variation of Jewish masculinity. This book, incidentally, won the 2012 National Jewish Book Council Award.|$|E

25|$|Filming {{and most}} of the {{production}} was completed over September and October 2016 in Los Angeles on a very condensed schedule. In the revival, Ray, Yount, and Vaughn recorded the riffs for all fourteen episodes in a sound studio over a period of a week, allowing them to better synchronize the riffs with the film. This also helped to simplify the process of filming the theater segments, since they then only needed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> their parts. The 'bots were controlled by multiple puppeteers both in the theater and in skits; Yount and Vaughn used radio-controlled equipment to move the 'bots' mouths, while members from The Jim Henson Company helped with manipulating the bodies, allowing them to achieve effects they could not do in the series' original run such as having Crow appear to walk on his own. All skits for the episodes were completed within a single day, which did not allow them for doing multiple takes unless necessary.|$|E
25|$|The Ainsworth {{family moved}} to Smedly Lane, north of Manchester in Cheetham Hill, during 1811. They kept the old {{residence}} {{in addition to the}} new, but resided in the new home most of the time. The surrounding hilly country was covered in woods, which allowed Ainsworth and his brother <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>out</b> various stories. When not playing, Ainsworth was tutored by his uncle, William Harrison. In March 1817, he was enrolled at Manchester Grammar School, which was described in his novel Mervyn Clitheroe. The work emphasised that his classical education was of good quality but was reinforced with strict discipline and corporal punishment. Ainsworth was a strong student and was popular among his fellow students. His school days were mixed; his time within the school and with his family was calm even though there were struggles within the Manchester community, the Peterloo Massacre taking place in 1819. Ainsworth was connected to the event because his uncles joined in protest at the incident, but Ainsworth was able to avoid most of the political after-effects. During the time, he was able to pursue his own literary interests and even created his own little theatre within the family home at King Street. Along with his friends and brother, he created and acted in many plays throughout 1820.|$|E
