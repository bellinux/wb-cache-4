5|$|David A.

According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could have prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> general-purpose test suite could serve as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts.

However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E

In this tale, glaciers and, later, solid landmasses built up around it, forming the lake, and Mussie was trapped.

5|$|After {{their victory}} over LSU in the BCS National Championship Game, Alabama's final team {{statistics}} were released. On the defensive {{side of the}} ball, of the 120 FBS teams, the Crimson Tide was ranked {{at the top of}} all major defensive categories in conference and nationally. They ranked first in total defense (183.62 yards per game), scoring defense (8.15 points per game), passing defense (111.46 yards per game) and rushing defense (72.15 yards per game). It marked the first time <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> defense ranked first in all four major, team defensive categories since the 1986 Oklahoma squad. Individually, Dont’a Hightower led the team with 85 total tackles, 45 of which were assisted, and Mark Barron was the leader with 43 solo tackles. Courtney Upshaw was tied for sixteenth nationally, fourth in conference and first on the team with 9.5 quarterback sacks. Upshaw was also eighteenth nationally, second in conference and first on the team with 18 tackles for loss. DeMarcus Milliner led the team with three of Alabama’s thirteen total interceptions of the season.|$|E
5|$|Albizu Campos {{had been}} {{corresponding}} with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose {{a group of}} nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to {{the leadership of the}} Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E
5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy.

Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
