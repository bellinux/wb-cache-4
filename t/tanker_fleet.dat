5|$|Gulf {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the Universe Ireland was added to Gulf's <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> At , this was the largest vessel in the world and incapable of berthing at most normal ports.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> for the USAF {{would be a huge}} boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
5|$|Two of the V-bombers, the Victor and the Vulcan, {{played a}} {{high-profile}} role during the 1982 Falklands War. In order {{to cross the}} vast distance of the Atlantic Ocean, a single Vulcan required refuelling several times from Victor tankers. A total of three bombing missions were flown against Argentine forces deployed to the Falklands, with approximately 1.1 milliongal (5 millionL) of fuel consumed in each mission. At the time, these missions held {{the record for the}} world's longest-distance bombing raids. The deployment of other assets to the theatre, such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and Lockheed Hercules, required the support of the Victor <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet,</b> which had been temporarily relocated to RAF Ascension Island for the campaign. The Victor also undertook several reconnaissance missions over the South Atlantic. These missions provided valuable intelligence for the retaking of South Georgia by British forces.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet,</b> and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> {{increased}} around 12 {{percent annually}} around 1970, a shortage on tonnage remained. In 1973 {{this resulted in}} an enormous increase in new building orders, especially from oil majors that wanted to gain on the quicker deciding independents, who could ask enormous rates for their vessels. Where the existing <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> comprised some 150 million long tons, in {{a quarter of a}} year a tonnage of 75 million was ordered, although new build prices doubled.|$|E

25|$|In December 1987, the {{director}} of Fire and Aviation Management for the USFS instructed Fred Fuchs, Deputy Director of Fire and Aviation, to request that the Department of Defense cooperate with civilian contractors in a plan to obtain surplus military transport aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, which could be converted to airtankers. Besides replacing the grounded C-119s, this program was intended to modernize the <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> to all-turbine aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The MC-130P {{series of}} {{aircraft}} entered service in 1965 during the Vietnam War as HC-130H CROWN airborne controllers to locate downed aircrew and direct Combat Search and Rescue operations over North Vietnam. After tanker equipment {{was added to}} 11 HC-130Hs, they entered service as HC-130P SAR command and control/helicopter aerial refueling aircraft in November 1966. Combat Shadows {{have been part of}} the Air Force special operations force since 1986.

25|$|A {{diminishing}} U.S. fleet {{contrasted with}} the burgeoning of international sea trade. For example, worldwide demand for natural gas led {{to the growth of}} the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet,</b> which reached 370 vessels as of 2007. In 2007 the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) set uniform LNG training standards at U.S. maritime training facilities. While short-term imports are declining, longer term projections signal an eightfold increase in U.S. imported LNG by 2025, the worldwide LNG fleet does not include a single U.S. flagged vessel. Moreover, only five U.S. deepwater LNG ports were operational in 2007, although permits have been issued for four additional ports, according to MARAD.|$|E

25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the world <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E
25|$|During late 1981, it {{was soon}} clear that the modern Mirage F-1s and the Soviet MiG-25s were {{effective}} against the Iranians. The IQAF began to use their new Eastern weaponry which included Tu-22KD/KDP bombers, equipped with Kh-22M/MP air-to-ground missiles, MiG-25s equipped with Kh-23 air-to-ground missiles as well as Kh-25 and Kh-58 anti-radar missiles and also MiG-23BNs, equipped with Kh-29L/T missiles. In 1983, to satisfy the Iraqis waiting for their upgraded Exocet-capable Mirage F-1EQ5s, Super Etendards were leased to Iraq. The Iranian oil <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> (see Tanker War) and gunboats suffered severe damage at {{the hand of the}} 5 Super Etendards equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles. One of these was lost during their 20-month combat use and 4 returned to the Aeronavale in 1985.|$|E
25|$|From 1912 Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — {{founded in}} 1909 by Weetman Pearson {{to develop the}} newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> They quickly adopted Isherwood's new {{longitudinal}} framing system that allowed much larger ships and a simpler construction process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's pipe line system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused {{a rise in the}} demand for tankers, which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.|$|E

5000|$|Although U-boats {{and surface}} raiders {{had begun to}} take a heavy toll of tankers, {{in the summer of}} 1940 there was a surplus of these ships because of the {{incorporation}} into the British merchant marine of <b>tanker</b> <b>fleets</b> from countries overrun by Germany. The combination of CS propellers and 100 octane fuel put the British fighters on par with the Luftwaffe.

500|$|Following the battle, Yamato withdrew {{with the}} Mobile Fleet to the Hashirajima staging area near Kure to refuel and rearm. With Musashi {{she left the}} fleet on 24 June for the short journey to Kure, where she {{received}} five more triple 25mm anti-aircraft mounts. The opportunity was taken {{to put in place}} [...] "emergency buoyancy keeping procedures". These resulted in the removal of almost every flammable item from the battleship, including linoleum, bedding, and mattresses. In place of the latter, men slept on planks which could be used to repair damage. Flammable paints received a new silicon based overcoat, and additional portable pumps and fire fighting apparatus were installed. Leaving Japan on 8 July, Yamato—accompanied by the battleships Musashi, , Nagato, and eleven cruisers and destroyers—sailed south. Yamato and Musashi headed for the Lingga Islands, arriving on 16–17 July. By this stage of the war, Japan's <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> had been much reduced by marauding American submarines, so major fleet units were stationed in the East Indies to be near the source of their fuel supply. The battleships remained at the islands for the next three months.|$|E

[...] The Texas Air National Guard's 136th Air Refueling Wing inaugurated Operation Creek Party on 1 May 1967, because the Regular Air Force did not have enough KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft available in Europe to train its fighter pilots in USAFE. [...] The operation eventually involved nine ANG air refueling groups that rotated approximately every two weeks to Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Sanctions {{tightened}} further when major supertanker {{companies said}} they would stop loading Iranian cargo. Prior attempts to reduce Iran's oil income failed because many vessels are often managed by companies outside the United States and the EU; however, EU actions in January extended the ban to ship insurance. This insurance ban will affect 95 percent of the <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> because their insurance falls under rules governed by European law. [...] "It's the insurance that's completed the ban on trading with Iran," [...] commented one veteran ship broker. This completion of the trading ban left Iran struggling to find a buyer for {{nearly a quarter of}} its annual oil exports. Iran has sought to manage the impact of international sanctions and limit capital outflows by promoting a [...] "resistance economy," [...] replacing imports with domestic goods and banning luxury imports such as computers and mobile phones. [...] This is predicted to lead to an increase in smuggling, as [...] "people {{will find a way to}} smuggle in what the Iranian consumer wants." [...] To sustain oil imports, Iran has also provided domestic insurance for tankers shipping Iranian oil. Iran had hoped to sell more to Chinese and Indian refiners, though such attempts seem unlikely to succeed, particularly since China—the single-largest buyer of Iranian crude—has been curtailing its oil imports from Iran down to half their former level.|$|E
