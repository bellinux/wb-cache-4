5000|$|C2 - The C2 STE {{is similar}} to the Tactical STE but C2 has {{modified}} software for use with its Tactical <b>Terminal</b> <b>Locking</b> Handset mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Key {{features}} of the 580 EX II that make it desirable are a built-in PC <b>terminal,</b> easy <b>locking</b> metal foot, faster recycling time, silent charge, a much easier-to-use battery cover and support for setup through the camera's menu system.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Teletype terminals, the Uniscope {{minimizes}} {{the number of}} I/O interrupts required by accepting large blocks of data, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coax cable and hardware devices known as multiplexors. A Uniscope operator awaits a prompt from the remote mainframe. The prompt indicates that the mainframe is ready to receive input. The operator enters data, offline from the mainframe, and then presses the Transmit button. The <b>terminal</b> <b>locks</b> the keyboard and sends to the mainframe what the operator entered. All the data goes in a single transmission and that causes a single interrupt at the mainframe. Eventually, the mainframe responds, sometimes with a single line; other times with a screen-load of data. And the cycle repeats.|$|R
50|$|If a stray wire {{from another}} circuit touches the wire {{connected}} {{to that same}} relay, then {{that would be a}} wrong side failure, which is potentially dangerous. This stray wire can be guarded against by ensuring that the insulation on the relay wire is of good quality, and that all <b>terminals</b> are <b>locked</b> away.|$|R
25|$|Winners {{of large}} prizes often bypass the Lotto outlet and go {{straight}} to Lotto NZ's head office in Auckland. Claiming prizes over $5,000 and special draw prizes cause the processing Lotto <b>terminal</b> to <b>lock</b> for security reasons, and the terminal operator must call Lotto NZ to unlock the terminal, giving Lotto NZ staff {{a chance to talk}} to the winners.|$|R
5|$|Most bus {{services}} {{are provided by}} First West of England or Crosville Motor Services. All services call at stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area, including some stops in the adjacent High Street. Some town services and those to Sand Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. The service to Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus. National Express and Bakers Dolphin operate long distance coach services, mostly from the coach <b>terminal</b> in <b>Locking</b> Road Car Park which {{is close to the}} railway station.|$|R
5000|$|The Bicikelj system {{consists}} of 300 bikes and 32 stations, 300 to 500 m {{away from each}} other. The stations are equipped with an automatic rental <b>terminal</b> for <b>locking</b> and unlocking approximately 20 bicycles each. The first 60 minutes of bike rental is free. After the first 60 minutes, the hourly rental rate for total hours beyond the first 60 minutes is debited from the user's bank account. However, bikes can be rented for free longer than one hour [...] "serially" [...] during a day if a minimum of five minutes has passed between the two free rides. The total number of free rides over the period of users' subscription is unlimited.|$|R
25|$|Deposit: A small {{cash deposit}} {{releases}} the bike from a <b>locked</b> <b>terminal</b> {{and can only}} be retrieved by returning it to another. Since the deposit (usually one or more coins) is {{a fraction of the}} bike's cost, this does little to deter theft. Other bike sharing programmes have implemented rules requiring the user to provide a valid credit card, along with substantial security deposits for bicycles and mandatory security locks.|$|R

50|$|Sky News {{correspondent}} Alex Crawford used BGAN {{equipment to}} provide live coverage, from a moving truck, {{of the news}} network's coverage of the liberation of Tripoli, Libya, in August 2011. This {{was done by the}} producer continuously readjusting the BGAN terminal to track the BGAN satellite. In-Motion BGAN satellite terminals are often used by media outlets for streaming video on the move. Another advantage to in-motion BGAN systems are for saving precious minutes when arriving at a live event. A media vehicle equipped with an in-motion system does not require pointing time since the in-motion BGAN <b>terminal</b> is already <b>locked</b> on satellite.|$|R
5000|$|TLM (The Learning Manager) was {{released}} in 1980 and included distinct roles for students, instructors, educational assistants, and administrators. The system could be accessed remotely by dial-up as a student or an instructor using a terminal emulator. The system had a sophisticated test bank capability and generated tests and practice activities based on a learning objective data structure. Instructors and students could communicate through the <b>terminal.</b> Instructors could <b>lock</b> out students or post messages. Originally called LMS (Learning Management System), TLM was used extensively at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) and Bow Valley College, both located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} {{are found in}} aviation glass cockpits, such as the Mark II avionics of the F-111D in the late 1960s/early 1970s (first ordered 1967, delivered 1970-73). Hewlett-Packard developed them for use in computers/calculators in the 1970s. The HP 9830 desktop computer was the first calculator with two rows of 4 keys, over which a paper overlay would be placed. These were later adapted to terminals. Programmers found that the HP 2640 <b>terminals</b> could <b>lock</b> the top two lines of the screen, so they displayed the key functions there. Starting with HP 2647 terminal, the keys were re-arranged to correspond with 2 pairs of 4 labels {{at the bottom of}} the screen. These could be programmed by escape sequence or configuration screen. This would be further developed on the failed HP 300 Amigo, which used keys at the right side of the screen and HP 250 business computers which placed them at the bottom. By arranging functions in hierarchical trees, many functions can be implemented with only 8 keys.|$|R
50|$|The North Eastern Railway (NER) began {{planning}} for a rival dock east of Alexandra Dock began in the 1890s, eventually leading to a joint agreement between the NER and Hull and Barnsley Railway (HBR), and an Act of Parliament in 1899, the Joint Dock Act. Construction of the dock was delayed, beginning 1906 for completion in 1914, {{at which point the}} new dock became officially known as the King George Dock. An extension arm of the dock to the south-east, sharing the same lock was opened as the Queen Elizabeth Dock in 1969. In 1993, the dock gained a <b>terminal</b> outside the <b>lock</b> gates, {{on the banks of the}} Humber, known as River Terminal 1, now known as Rotterdam Terminal, used by North Sea Ferries.|$|R
