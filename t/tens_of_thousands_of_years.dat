The island was colonized by the Dutch in the 17th century, followed by an influx of Han Chinese including Hakka immigrants from the Fujian and Guangdong areas of China, across the Taiwan Strait.

25|$|Because PCR amplifies {{the regions}} of DNA that it targets, PCR {{can be used to}} analyze {{extremely}} small amounts of sample.

25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{produced no}} elements heavier than lithium, {{due to a}} bottleneck: {{the absence of a}} stable nucleus with 8 or 5 nucleons. This deficit of larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In stars, the bottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing carbon (the triple-alpha process). However, this process is very slow and requires much higher densities, taking <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> to convert a significant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a negligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.|$|E
25|$|The Dolmens {{widespread}} in Europe {{and much of}} Asia are interpreted as Neolithic burial chambers. Large boulders make excellent long term markers for important and sacred places, just as burial plots are marked by large stones today.

Boulders will last for <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> In memory of a person or the history about a place, these markers help future generations {{to learn about the}} past.

25|$|At {{about the}} same time as {{meteorite}} concentrations were being discovered in the cold desert of Antarctica, collectors discovered that many meteorites could also be found in the hot deserts of Australia. Several dozen meteorites had already been found in the Nullarbor region of Western and South Australia. Systematic searches between about 1971 and the present recovered more than 500 others, ~300 of which are currently well characterized. The meteorites can be found in this region because the land presents a flat, featureless, plain covered by limestone. In the extremely arid climate, there has been relatively little weathering or sedimentation on the surface for <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> allowing meteorites to accumulate without being buried or destroyed.
