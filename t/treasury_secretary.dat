5|$|<b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Franklin MacVeagh (1909–13) {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} investigate possible advantages (e.g., reduced cost, increased production speed) to issuing smaller sized United States banknotes. Due {{in part to the}} outbreak of World War I and the end of his appointed term, any recommendations may have stalled. On 20 August 1925, <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Andrew W. Mellon {{appointed a}} similar committee and in May 1927 accepted their recommendations for the size reduction and redesign of U.S. banknotes. On 10 July 1929 the new small-size currency was issued.|$|E
5|$|Among the men {{who studied}} law under Stevenson {{in his later years}} were future U.S. <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> John G. Carlisle and future Kentucky Governor William Goebel. Goebel {{eventually}} became Stevenson's law partner and the executor of his will.|$|E
5|$|In March, Obama's <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary,</b> Timothy Geithner, took further {{steps to}} manage the {{financial}} crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to twotrillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.|$|E

5|$|U.S. <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> William Gibbs McAdoo (soon {{to become}} Wilson's son-in-law) {{proposed}} the most centralized model, featuring a Government central bank within the Treasury Department, no regional reserve system, and currency a government liability.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 1993, , a bill {{to reduce}} the salary of the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> from $148,400 to $99,500 (the pre-1989 level), passed by a voice vote in the Senate and by the House on January 6. On January 19, President George H.W. Bush signed a bill {{enacting}} a temporary Saxbe fix so that Senator Lloyd Bentsen could move from the Senate {{to take the job}} of <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> during the newly elected Clinton administration. S.J. RES. 1 (1993), which canceled emolument increases for the remainder of Bentsen's term, a term set to expire at noon on January 3, 1995, had been passed by both Houses without objection. However, in a law review article, University of Minnesota Law School Professor Michael Stokes Paulson rejected the Bentsen fix as unconstitutional. In 1994, President Bill Clinton received approval to use a Saxbe fix to appoint United States Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to the Supreme Court, but Mitchell withdrew his name from consideration for reasons unrelated to his eligibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. It met no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process. After it passed, the two engravers produced designs, but <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> William G. McAdoo required changes, not {{all of which were}} made.|$|E

50|$|The new <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary's</b> agenda {{includes}} {{the implementation of}} the tax reform incorporated in Puerto Rico's new Internal Revenue Code (Law 1 of 2011) and rolling out IVU Lotto, a new free lottery designed to increase sales tax revenues by at least 50%.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Paulson co-wrote a Wall Street Journal {{op-ed piece}} {{suggesting}} {{an alternative to}} the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary's</b> plan for stabilizing the markets, (i.e. recapitalized the troubled financial institutions by spending the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program funds to buy their senior preferred stock rather than their [...] "worst assets").|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} Republican politicians, such as <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> George Cortelyou, tested the waters {{for a run}} but chose to stay out. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against {{corporate}} corruption. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages. Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.|$|E
5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Secretary Paul O'Neill asked Quarles {{to return}} to the Treasury, where he served until the mid-term {{elections}} in 2006. At the Treasury, Quarles was a senior official under all three of George W. Bush's <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretaries</b> and developed policy on an unusually broad range of matters in both domestic and international financial affairs.|$|R
5|$|During Hamilton's {{tenure as}} <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary,</b> {{political}} factions began to emerge. A Congressional caucus, led by James Madison and William Branch Giles, {{began as an}} opposition group to Hamilton's financial programs, and Thomas Jefferson joined this group {{when he returned from}} France. Hamilton and his allies began to call themselves Federalists. The opposition group, now called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists, was at the time known as Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel {{was elected}} on February 22, 2011 with 55% {{of the vote}} and {{was sworn in as}} the 55th Mayor of Chicago on May 16, 2011 at the Pritzker Pavilion.

Daley, brother of the outgoing mayor and who would later serve as White House Chief of Staff. Emanuel is Chicago's first Jewish mayor.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{held one}} of his {{numerous}} press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration {{to balance the budget}} and cut spending and taxes. He argued that Reagan had reneged on his 1980 campaign promise to balance the budget, resulting in voter dissatisfaction. Paul stated that <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|Pierce charged <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> James Guthrie with {{reforming}} the Treasury, which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury, large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican convention, Taft and Roosevelt had {{discussed}} which cabinet officers would stay on. Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer (who was {{shifted to the}} Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included Philander Knox, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and Franklin MacVeagh as <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Joint Commission was tasked {{to report}} on the {{implementation}} of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations {{from time to time to}} the president, the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary,</b> and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|The Mint began {{preparation}} for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and the coin had near unanimous support from the Mint and the vending machine industry, an influential lobby {{in the area of}} coin design and creation. In 1977, <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary</b> Michael Blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of Liberty would be a suitable subject for the coin.|$|E
5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become <b>Treasury</b> <b>Secretary,</b> Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
