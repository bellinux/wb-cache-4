500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> sign".|$|E

500|$|Part of the {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the Shakespeare play Richard III, most notably, the interaction between Richard and Lady Anne. The biggest inspiration for the episode, however, came from the fact that Davis wished to have an episode wherein he would interact solely with Gillian Anderson. He later noted, [...] "if they're not going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> scene with Gillian, I'll just have to write one myself." [...] The episode's title, [...] "En Ami," [...] translates from French into English as [...] "as a friend." [...] The title also functions as a pun, reading phonetically as [...] "enemy" [...] in English.|$|E
500|$|Wilson was {{notable for}} making anagrams {{based on the}} names {{of his friends and}} acquaintances. [...] M'Clure {{described}} them as numerous and nimble, and if not exact, they were always instructive, and he would rather force a poor match than lose the moral. [...] An anecdote given by Wilson biographer M'Clure, whether true or not, points to the character of Wilson: [...] a person met Wilson returning from a journey and remarked, [...] "Sir, I have sad news for you: [...] while you have been abroad, your house is burnt." [...] To this Wilson is reputed to have replied, [...] "Blessed be God! [...] He has burnt this house, because he intends <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> better." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's story {{received}} mixed reviews. Sliva {{said the}} narrative was [...] "drenched in uninteresting pathos that failed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> reason {{to care about}} these characters that I've spent well over 100 hours with." [...] Juba called the story [...] "a joke", saying {{that there was little}} development for Lightning as a character, and that the narrative [...] "killed whatever lingering investment [...] had in the universe." [...] VanOrd found the large amount of character dialogue a distracting and jarring feature, while Parkin said that the game's narrative could not fix the issues present in the previous two XIII games, although the side-quests and dialogue helped lighten Lightning's character. Elliot spoke of it as one of the reasons to play the game, terming it a [...] "typically bonkers narrative".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} September 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets are just like little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few pointers and tips for acting with them, {{but the most important thing}} that I learned was to keep eye contact." [...] Also in August 2004, BBC News reported that Quentin Tarantino would appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: [...] "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." [...] Also that year, Fuller wrote: [...] "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dark feeling... It {{seems to me that}} my future upon earth will soon close... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{began work}} on the story {{following}} the culmination of his fourth Tintin adventure, Cigars of the Pharaoh, and it was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième over the following months under the title Popol et Virginie au pays de Lapinos ("Popol and Virginie in the Land of the Lapinos"). The names of the characters were inspired by Bernadin de Saint-Pierre's pastoral novel Paul and Virginia. The use of talking animals followed {{in the tradition of}} fables by La Fontaine and that of J.J. Grandville's illustrations, as well as the contemporary American films of Walt Disney. Hergé would describe the story as an opportunity [...] "to get away from realism for a bit", adding that it allowed him [...] "A little unreality <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> break from the rules of 'credibility' to which I'm subjected with Tintin." [...] It was not, however, received with much enthusiasm from the paper's readership, with many readers writing in to ask when The Adventures of Tintin would resume.|$|E

500|$|In October 1948, the Progressive Conservatives also {{elected a}} new leader, Ontario Premier George A. Drew. Drew had won three {{consecutive}} provincial elections, taking even francophone ridings, and the Tories, perennially weak in Quebec, hoped that Drew could repeat his success {{on a national}} scale. [...] Drew defeated Diefenbaker for the leadership. [...] St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and Howe again was successful in fundraising from corporate backers. Major corporations from the CPR to Eaton's contributed to the well financed Liberal campaign. The Liberals won a huge victory, taking 190seats to 40 for the Tories, and Howe again won Port Arthur easily. [...] Drew had used Howe's record as an election issue, accusing him of being power mad and of selling off Crown Corporations for bargain prices, but the allegations got little traction. According to Howe, the only result of Drew's attacks [...] "was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> record majority in Port Arthur!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 2010, in an {{interview}} to the Grimsby Telegraph, Woodhouse commented he would definitely consider a move back to former club Grimsby Town after expressing his dismay at The Mariners languishing {{near the bottom of}} the League Two, within danger of being relegated from the Football League. He commented [...] "If they are looking for a central midfielder, though, they are welcome <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> call". Harrogate released him by mutual consent on 25 February. Three days later he avenged his defeat by Jay Morris by beating him with a TKO in round 3. This gave Woodhouse the first title of his boxing career, the International Masters light-welterweight title. On 25 April, Woodhouse defended the title with a 4th-round knockout of Maurycy Gojko, who stepped in as a late replacement for Steve Saville. Next, on 2 July, Woodhouse knocked out veteran Stefy Bull in round 9. His next fight was due to be against 2006 Commonwealth Games gold medallist and former world amateur champion Frankie Gavin on 18 September, but Woodhouse pulled out days after the bout was announced in July. He moved up the non-League football ladder in June 2011, after signing for Conference North side Eastwood Town.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place.
