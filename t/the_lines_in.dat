5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E

5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> the 1900s.|$|E

Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> an additional dialogue recording session once {{the film was}} finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay {{isolated}} helium on Earth {{by treating}} the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite {{with at least}} 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun., One of <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> <b>in</b> the Coronal Spectrum.

It was independently isolated from cleveite {{in the same year}} by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, South Framingham became an {{important}} regional rail hub. The Boston and Worcester built its 12-mile Milford Branch from South Framingham to Milford via Holliston in 1848. The next year, the B built a short branch to Framingham Center, which the B mainline had bypassed. This line, later called the Agricultural Branch Railroad, was realigned near Framingham Center and extended to Pratts Junction in Sterling in 1855. Franklin Street {{was built on the}} former branch right of way. The Agricultural Branch and the Framingham & Lowell (which branched off it at Framingham Center) were the northernmost section of the Old Colony Railroad, which took over <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> 1879.|$|E
5|$|With through running between <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage {{began as a}} horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E
