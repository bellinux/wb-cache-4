Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to <b>totalise</b> current consumption.

This is intensified {{in the case}} of Dexter (2006 -present) where the story's continuance relies both on episodic restitution and viewer complicity.

50|$|Philosophically, Rowe's {{conviction}} that pragmatic, discrete, and episodic ideas are more meaningful and useful than <b>totalising,</b> overarching, all-inclusive concepts led him towards the political right, and to such philosophers as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper; but paradoxically this also situated his {{thinking in the}} same general zone as left-leaning philosophers like Gianni Vattimo.As he continued to publish ground-breaking, intellectually rich, unconventional essays on the history and theory of architecture, and became a permanent resident of the United States (becoming a US citizen {{towards the end of}} his life) he went on to influence many other architects, students, and architectural educators during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (in 1966 he served as a fellow at the Graham Foundation in Chicago) {{at a time when there}} was a move towards Postmodern architecture with which he may be partly associated - though only to a very limited extent, and only in a philosophical sense, since his intellectual range, and his all-inclusive interest in every movement and style of architecture, placed him far outside any particular stylistic category.

40|$|Recent {{writing on}} {{religion}} in Gujarat has often confused political rhetoric with common religious belief and practice. Thus, religious categories have become caricatures standing for sociological realities and <b>totalised</b> worldviews. In this scheme, ‘Hindus’ and ‘Muslims’ {{are supposed to}} believe different things which ensure that they see and act in the world quite differently. In this paper, I examine the narratives of blame that emerged after the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat. The ethnography suggests that although religious identity {{plays a role in}} the way blame is cast, people of different religious communities also use common frames of logic and their shared experiences of shock and alienation to explain catastrophe. The religious reasoning of blame narratives is therefore shown to have a broader cultural existence outside the boundaries of particular religious identities...|$|R
40|$|Radio and the {{recording}} business have, {{since the beginning}} of the last century, had a profound impact upon existing musical life whenever and wherever they have decisively and irreversibly established themselves. Their arrival restructures and redefines the social relations of music in many aspects of its production, performance and reception. Radio and recording technologies have had a significant impact on the livelihoods of all those who one way or another try to make a living from music (composers, performers and - in Europe - publishers, for instance). Performance itself is transformed as new norms are set in place which call for new levels of technique and interpretation. Finally the conditions of musical reception are reconfigured and new `taste publics' emerge, potentially in conflict with each other, as musical life is <b>totalised</b> into a new and complex unity. ...|$|R
40|$|Parody may be {{understood}} as the absorption of a revolutionary impulse into the everyday production of meaning as continuous variation and soft subversion. Considered in this way, parody is transformative because it operates on the components within a system of meaning and/or the context, logic or spatial perspective that grounds the possibility of meaning. It is {{the conditions under which}} shared meaning, sense and sensation depend that I aim to unpack in order to suggest the ways in which parody can alter a person’s relationship to the world. By approaching parody as a mode of lived abstraction and as an embodied approach to affective self-organisation, body-environment co-construction and a challenge to identity, it becomes possible to move from formal concerns that have characterised parody to a set of transformative practices. Thus parody indicates where the anchors of embodied, embedded, extended, enacted and affective are dug in and hold identity and the ground of meaning in a steady state. This paper will examine how parody moves from the impulse to overthrow and invert — ‘Beneath the street, The beach’—to a collective impulse that moves the ground of meaning into a reconfigurative process that is allows <b>totalised</b> systems of meaning to collide and intersect. What is left is not the rubble and ruins of meaning but revitalised fragments, stems cells of meaning ready-to-be-remade. A lineage of parodic works will be paraded and discussed that directly address the tacit relation of ground, horizon, orientation and position. This parody parade will form the basis of a critique and the analysis of the ontological orientations that for example, opposing systems of perspective insert as the very ground of meaning. The implication of this line of inquiry leads to the assertion that all descriptions of the world, universe and the cosmos are parodies in search of an origin. <b>Totalised</b> or unified images of the ground of meaning are already parodies of a/the set of conditions by which meaning operates that also produce a trajectory that as a lived-abstraction directs or hijacks subsequent productions of meanin...|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} {{transnational}} class formation was central {{in the work}} at the University of Amsterdam. It built on the writings of Christian Palloix, Nikos Poulantzas, Alfred Sohn-Rethel and on the materialist Cold War history in the United States (Joyce and Gabriel Kolko). Van der Pijl’s contribution was on the transmission of American mass production to Western Europe in the Marshall Plan and the relegation of the cartelised European steel industry {{to the role of}} a supplier for the automobile industry, resulting in a first book in Dutch (1978). Economic statesmen involved in this process weld their different ‘fractional’ perspectives (heavy/light industrial, national/international trade, investment and commercial banking, etc.) into ‘globale beheersconcepties’ (comprehensive concepts of control, a notion coined by Ries Bode). A concept of control projects a presumed general interest <b>totalising</b> all others, under the guidance of the dominant fraction. In his doctoral dissertation of 1983 and the book based on it (The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class, Verso 1984, reprinted with a new preface 2012), Van der Pijl applied this to the evolution of transatlantic class formation. In Transnational Classes and International Relations (Routledge 1998), neoliberalism is identified as the hegemonic concept of control in the closing decades of the 20th century. This book also analyses the managerial ‘cadre’, an auxiliary class of salaried functionaries with directive-educative roles. The cadre typically come to the fore in major crises (the 1930s, the 1970s, and again today), proposing managerial alternatives to liberalism. If not checked by popular mobilization, their intervention may assume authoritarian forms.|$|E
30|$|The {{efforts to}} {{categorise}} COTM while placing them under one conceptual heading bears striking parallelisms with the <b>totalising</b> and individualising features of productive power. Productive power is characteristically <b>totalising</b> because it pervades {{all aspects of}} life and draws everything to an acceptable norm, while also being individualising {{in the sense that}} it defines individuals in relation to that norm. COTM as an umbrella term for categorised children is therefore <b>totalising</b> because it greatly expands the productive power of the sector beyond exploitation and human trafficking, yet it is also individualising since it calcifies the segmentation of children into predetermined categories and bases their right to be protected solely on their individual best interests, ‘independently of their migration status, gender, age, health, nationality, religious or cultural belongings or any other ground’ (Terre des Hommes International Federation 2012).|$|E
