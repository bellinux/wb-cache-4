40|$|MyPyramid is a {{guide to}} help people of any age plan a healthy diet. As we age, we need to plan more {{carefully}} the food that we choose {{in order to stay}} healthy. Individual calorie and nutrient needs change over time. This series of Putting MyPyramid on Your Table can help you choose foods that fit into a daily food plan to maintain good health. Foods in the meat and bean group contain protein. Protein is needed to repair body cells and make new ones. Meat and beans also provide B vitamins, iron, and zinc, which help boost the immune system, build and repair muscle, and help brain function. MyPyramid suggests we eat 5 ounces of meat or its equivalent for those on a 2, 000 calorie a day diet. Dried beans or peas, eggs, peanut butter, or nuts also contain protein and {{they are part of the}} meat group. Note these equivalents: ■ 1 ounce meat, poultry, or fish ■ cup cooked dry beans or peas ■ 1 egg ■ 1 <b>tablespoon</b> peanut <b>butter</b> ■ ounce of nuts or seed...|$|R
50|$|A <b>tablespoon</b> {{of either}} <b>butter</b> {{contains}} 95 calories, 1.5 grams of fibre, 3 grams of carbohydrate, 8 grams of fat, and 4 grams of protein. Also, {{the fat in}} both are mainly unsaturated, thus does not raise blood cholesterol. They are also both good sources of monounsaturated fat. However, almond butter does provide more nutrients than normal peanut butter. Lastly, it contains more calcium and magnesium. Given all this, though, peanut butter does contain more vitamin B. Thus, {{it is hard to}} say which is “healthier”. One must still consult the label and make a personal decision based on individual needs. Overall, both are good sources of nutrients. It is also suggested {{to stay away from the}} “light” butters, as oftentimes they do contain less fat, but more of other adversarial ingredients.|$|R
40|$|His {{street was}} not {{affected}} by the fire at the Pantheon, although [Robert] Batty's shop was destroyed {{and he and his}} family took refuge with Smith. Responds to Davall's letters of 31 January and 3 February 1792 : promises to visit Davall soon but wants to publish his "Sketch of a Tour on the Continent" and "Systema vegetabilum" first; François [Borone] to be [Adam] Afzelius' assistant in Sierra Leone, commissioned by the new Company to collect plants for at least a year, advantageous situation for Borone, and Smith will receive a share of the plants, roots, and seeds collected; when François returns Smith intends to tour to Genoa to visit Davall and Mount Cenis again; impatient to hear from [Dominique] Villars; applauds Davall's comments on naming of plants after botanists, shall give Davall's name to 'Trichomanes canariense' but requests a paper from him for second volume of "Linnean Transactions"; has no duplicate of 'Smithia sensitivia', it flowered and seeded at Turin in 1790; admires Davall's manner of drying plants. [Carl Peter] Thunberg compared specimen of his [Smith's] 'Festuca' with [Joachim] Burser's [(1583 - 1639) ] original specimen at Upsala, so there is now no doubt, but [Martin] Vahl [(1749 - 1804) ] has published discovery as his own in second volume of "Symbolae botanicae" but made mistake of saying he learned what 'Anthoxanthum paniculatum' was from the Linnaean herbarium. Has been introduced to the Royal Family as this summer he is to arrange the Queen's herbarium, previously [John] Lightfoot's, give the Queen and princesses a course of botany; comments on the Queen's behaviour and dignity. Has not taken any salary for the job for the sake of dignity and future influence and interest. Prescribes a <b>tablespoon</b> of melted <b>butter</b> with the salt skimmed off before bed for Davall's costiveness; excellent for bowel complaints but "neglected for nasty drugs & irritating oils". Eager to see vegetable part of [Johann Friedrich] Gmelin's [(1748 - 1804) ] "Systema naturae". Glad Davall found [Johann] Hermann agreeable, "an excell[ent] & pleasant man". Pleased Davall likes his figure of 'Festuca spadicea'. Waiting for lichens before sending parcel of plants, will also send second edition of "Flora Lapponica"...|$|R
