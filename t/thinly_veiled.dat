Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class.

5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a <b>thinly</b> <b>veiled</b> autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
40|$|Between 1952 and 1970, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt's Free Officers Movement {{established}} the paradigmatic pan-Arabist revolution from above.

By contrast, this contribution underlines the impact of the British colonial context on the Free Officers' political formation and their early identification with pan-Arabism in turn. Drawing on pamphlets, speeches, media output and memoirs, it shows that the Free Officers developed a distinctive form of anticolonial nationalism that emphasised social justice and invoked overlapping Egyptian and Arab identities. Their aspirations for liberation thus entailed a connected foreign policy and nation building programme in which pan-Arabism was a prime – and early – component...|$|R
50|$|In 1689, {{on their}} {{return from the}} Battle of Dunkeld, the MacIains of Glencoe (a sept of Clan MacDonald), {{together}} with their Glengarry cousins, looted Glenlyon, stole his livestock, and razed Campbell's last remaining holdings, increasing his financial problems from debts.

In a final effort to support his wife and family, Robert Campbell, {{at the age of}} fifty nine, joined the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot and came to play his part in the Glencoe massacre. The fact of the stolen cattle and Glenlyon's involvement in the massacre were used by the authorities in an attempt to <b>thinly</b> <b>veil</b> the massacre as simply the outcome of thievery and clan rivalry.

5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands.

5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as <b>thinly</b> <b>veiled</b> threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing the cries of the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a <b>thinly</b> <b>veiled</b> portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

Tyran Grillo wrote in his review: [...] "Ukrainian pianist and composer Misha Alperin joins forces {{for the first time}} in session with British reedist John Surman (a last-minute replacement for Tore Brunborg) in this melodious, spontaneous set. Augmented by Arkady Shilkloper on French horn and flugelhorn, Terje Gewelt on bass, and Jon Christensen on drums, their hypnotic nexus breathes ounces of thematic life into the “Overture” in watery, stepwise motion. Surman’s reptilian soprano takes us in some unexpected directions throughout a holistic introduction, while his unmistakable baritone threads resilient cables through “Twilight house” and “City Dance.” The first of these is where the session truly comes to life through his interactions with Alperin, while the latter serves a touch of groove in a veritable trill buffet (think Snakeoil). “Movement” features classical percussionist Hans-Kristian Kjos Sørensen (heard previously on No Birch) in a spindly improv, the pointillism and melancholy draw of which only <b>thinly</b> <b>veil</b> its composed undercurrent.

40|$|Determining if an {{individual}} has implemented a new practice or changed their behavior {{as a result of}} an Extension program means that we must make a follow-up contact with that individual at some point in time after the conclusion of the program. We can make that contact through a personal visit to see what they have done. We can call them on the phone to ask about how their behavior has changed since participating in the program. Programs presented to groups that meet repeatedly over time allow for data collection to be done at subsequent meetings of the group. But one of the most cost-efficient methods of collecting information regarding practices and behaviors is use of a mailed questionnaire. Obviously there are drawbacks to using mailed questionnaires. Not the least of which is the unfavorable public sentiment regarding surveys, polls, and questionnaires in general. Much of this public sentiment has been shaped by unscrupulous individuals who use survey questions to <b>thinly</b> <b>veil</b> a sales pitch.

Both of these factors work in Extension’s favor when we conduct follow-up surveys to determine the impact of our programs. Program participants who receive our questionnaires often know quite...|$|R

40|$|Whether Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Epipsychidion—a Platonic poem on love {{addressed}} to the patriarchally imprisoned Theresa Viviani or “Emily”—receives praise or blame has generally been determined by two focal passages: a secular sermon on free love and a planetary allegorical <b>thinly</b> <b>veiling</b> his own imbroglio. This essay re-reads Shelley’s 1821 work drawing on two recent arguments: Stuart Curran’s Dantean call to take the poem’s Florentine narrator seriously as a character, not just as an autobiographical cypher, and Colin Jager’s outline of Shelley’s move beyond the assumptions of his professed atheism after 1816. Based on the poem’s structure and imagery, the paper argues that Epipsychidion critiques the false sense of revolutionary ascent and dualistic escape offered to Emily, who is commodified and erased by the narrator’s egocentric, “counterfeit divinization of eros” (Benedict XVI). Turning from this Radical Enlightenment Platonism, the poem momentarily realizes an embodied, hylomorphic romantic union akin to the Christian nuptial mystery of two becoming “one flesh” (Mark 10 : 8). This ideal, however, collapses back into solipsism when the narrator cannot understand or accept love as a “unity in duality” (Benedict XVI). This paper thus claims Epipsychidion as a post-secular inquiry into the problem of love whose philosophic limits and theological horizons are both surprising and instructive. It also reclaims Shelley as a phenomenological poet who can open up the world to Christian and non-Christian readers, one whose Platonic and Dantean formation lend him an openness to transcendence and one whose countercultural path through life makes him wary of inhumane appropriations of religion...|$|R

He wrote: America sells its shoes, machines, canned beef and so forth in Europe {{and all over the}} world not because they have an American style or are wrapped in the American flag, but simply because they are best. Thus also, the French export their paintings and birth-control, and the Germans export sauerkraut and prima donnas, because those things, each, are best.

How can the people agree on what is American style, if the painters themselves, and by their work, disagree profoundly as to what real painting itself is!

40|$|Modern {{parallel}} programming models perform their best under the particular patterns they are tuned to express and execute, such as OpenMP for fork/join and Cilk for divide-and-conquer patterns. In {{cases where the}} model does not fit the problem, shoehorning of the problem to the model leads to performance bottlenecks, for example by introducing unnecessary dependences. In addition, some of these models, like MPI, have a performance model which <b>thinly</b> <b>veils</b> a particular machine's parameters from the problem {{that is to be}} solved. We postulate that an expressive {{parallel programming}} model should not over-constrain the problem it expresses and should not require the application programmer to code for the underlying machine and sacrifice portability. In our former work, we proposed the Data-Driven Tasks model, which constitutes expressive and portable parallelism by only requiring the application programmer to declare the inherent dependences of the application. In this work, we observe another instantiation of macro-dataflow, the Open Community Runtime (OCR) with work-stealing support for directed-acyclic graph (DAG) parallelism. First, we assess the benefits of these macro-dataflow models over traditional fork/join models using work-stealing, where we match the performance of hand-tuned parallel libraries on today's architectures through DAG parallelism. Secondly, we address work-stealing granularity optimizations for DAG parallelism to address how work stealing can be extended to perform better under complex dependence graphs. Lastly, we observe the impact of locality optimizations for work-stealing runtimes for DAG-parallel applications. On our path to exascale computations, the priority is shifting from minimizing latency to energy saving as the current trend makes powering an exascale machine very challenging. The trend of providing more parallelism to fit power budgets succeeds if applications can be declared to be more parallel and also scale. We argue that macro-dataflow is a framework that allows programmers to declare unconstrained parallelism. We provide an underlying work-stealing runtime to execute this framework for load balance and scalability, and propose heuristics to extend the default work-stealing approach to better perform with DAG parallel programs. We present our results on a multi-socket many-core machine and a many-core accelerator to showcase the feasibility of our approach on architectures signaling what future architectures may resemble...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} importance of urban space {{in the works of}} feminist writers from France, Quebec, the Maghreb and Francophone West Africa. Each author writes women as subjects of their own experience in the city, identifies the representations of power and gender in urban landscapes, restores a feminist voice to the polis and supports women's claim to enfranchisement in urban space. My analysis is based upon the fundamental premise that urban space reflects power dynamics and is, like gender, a social and political construction borne of a dominant patriarchal ideology. The urban type of the female flaneuse, or ambulant heroine, is prevalent in several of the texts. These are women whose personal trajectories through the metropolis serve as a common referant to define their identity. Exploitation, disciplinary surveillance and disillusion characterize (1) Claire Etcherelli's urban dystopia in Elise ou la vraie vie. (2) Annie Ernaux's observations of life in the periphery of Paris in the Journal du dehors are centered on the market economy of the city and women's status as commodity. The deviant behavior of (3) Andree Chedid's virtually homeless, elderly heroine in La cite fertile <b>thinly</b> <b>veils</b> a provocative inquiry into the notion of urban identity. (4) Christine de Pizan and the Quebecoise writer, (5) Nicole Brossard both employ the metaphor of construction [...] architectural and textual [...] and share utopian visions of women's writing as the site for feminist praxis and cultural transformation. (6) Nina Bouraoui's cloistered Algerian heroine in La Voyeuse interdite and the women in (7) Assia Djebar's novels dare to defy and transgress the boundaries which exclude women from the urban realm in the Maghreb. (8) Calixthe Beyala's novels depict young African women struggling with issues of identity and survival in metropolises dominated by a repressive, patriarchal mentality. Throughout the texts, the city appears in multiple guises: as a text, a body, a marketplace, and a prison. For these authors, writing on the city constitutes a feminist act asserting women's right to claim a voice in that space. These works situate the city as a locus of cultural and political critique, whose spatial configurations reflect the social constructions of gender...|$|R

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the debate over the International Criminal Court lies the {{amorphous}} notion of globalization. Calling into question the normative assumptions driving international humanitarian efforts, the evolving conception of the sovereign state, strategic interactions among countries and the ability of the international community to work multilaterally towards a common vision of justice, the debate spans a broad range of issues concerning global governance. The United States? rocky relationship with the International Criminal Court is a particularly revealing entry point. Is the United States? opposition simply an expression of unilateralist arrogance and refusal to concede to an increasingly important system of global governance that much of the international community accepts? In fact, American non-support runs much deeper. Both a strategic approach to United States? foreign policy objectives and an examination of the ideological incompatibilities between the United States? Constitution and participation in the Court reveal the centrality of sovereignty in the debate. In a strategic sense, it is not {{in the interest of the}} United States to concede judicial autonomy to the International Criminal Court. In an ideological sense, the tensions are seemingly irresolvable. Both point to why the United States has become a global hegemonic power and how this hegemony plays out. Further, both reveal just how deeply the International Criminal Court renegotiates state sovereignty by shifting the standards of international human rights law. This thesis proceeds in three stages. First, it explores the position the International Criminal Court occupies in relation to the established tradition of international and specifically human rights law. Second, it evaluates the argument against American participation in the Court examining the alleged dissonance with constitutional democracy and tangible threats the institution poses to US foreign-relations objectives. Finally, it places the debate in the context of larger theoretical questions concerning sovereignty. Does the Court create an upheaval in the global order of sovereign nations in general? Or, does this claim of universality <b>thinly</b> <b>veil</b> the United States? ultimately particular concerns about the maintenance of hegemony within a changing global order. This thesis ends by exploring the potential alternatives for creating better agreement between the most deeply held ideological concerns driving the United States? foreign policy and the changing demands of international political environment while questioning the efficacy of international criminal adjudication in achieving human rights goals...|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} climate in America continues {{to become more}} polarized each year. The 2 ̆ 2 left 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 political parties are locked in near-constant struggle and it is often the people whom they are meant to serve that suffer the harshest effects of this struggle. This mainstream political posturing and hostile behavior has allowed for the continued presence, and some say resurgence, of racially motivated right-wing nationalist groups. Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and racist Skinheads have seen periods of strength and decline throughout American history. In the late 20 th and early 21 st Centuries {{they have begun to}} adapt their message to find acceptance in groups outside their own and plant the seeds of racial and ethnic bias and supremacy in minds not yet stricken with the illnesses of hate and bigotry. This research examines the ideological framing of far-right White Supremacist groups in the United States. Discussion of political, nationalist and economic ideologies and the ways these ideologies are framed and presented to wider audiences are described. Using content analysis, more than 50 editorials, articles and other writings from six of the most circulated newsletters produced by American based White Supremacist groups were examined. Thematic analysis and line-by-line coding allowed for the development of various codes related to nationalism, immigration, traditional supremacy and perceived political failure, as well as many others. Findings suggest that many White Supremacist groups and individuals are shifting away from the biological or genetic supremacist beliefs of a previous era.
