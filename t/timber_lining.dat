50|$|Most of the {{internal}} walls and ceilings in the house are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. However, the ceilings of what were formerly the northeast side and rear verandahs retain their original early <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> {{in the form of}} wide, tongue-and-groove boards with a central double beading. Floors throughout appear to be early, with evidence of weathering on the underneath of the former verandah floorboards.|$|E
50|$|Internally the {{building}} is divided by timber partitioning into eight rooms. The <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> throughout {{the building}} varies according to the building's growth.

50|$|The {{building}} {{which is}} raised {{from the ground}} on round timber stumps, has a rectangular plan and a corrugated iron gabled roof. The timber-framed building has exposed timber studwork, with horizontal <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> in some sections which are protected by verandahs. The symmetrically composed north-eastern facade features three projecting gabled bays, enclosed with weatherboards, with simple decorative barge boards, finials and vertical sash windows. These bays emphasise the central entrance and two end corners of this facade. Between the projecting elements is a bull-nosed verandah with diagonally crossed balustrading. The principal entrance, through the projecting central bay, is accessed via a straight timber stair from the east. High level openings, above the verandah awning, provide light and ventilation to the internal hall as do round openings on the gables of the north-eastern and south-western facades.|$|E
50|$|The former QATB centre is a two storey timber framed {{building}} with a corrugated iron roof. and has wide surrounding verandahs to both levels. The {{front of the building}} is clad with pressed metal sheeting which simulates bricks and stone quoins. This effect is heightened by appropriate painting. The sheeting is continued up into a parapet which conceals the roof from the street and carries the QATB Maltese cross insignia and the date 1921. The remainder of the building has exposed studs and a <b>timber</b> <b>lining.</b> The verandah to the upper floor has dowel balustrading and panels of lattice at the front corners and at the rear. There is a timber valance of vertical boards cut to form shallow arches between the timber post which support the verandah.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has rendered walls scribed to imitate ashlar stonework, and the roof construction consists of arched brace timber trusses supported by stone corbels. These trusses have original metal ties, which were incorporated to overcome the need for heavy king-posts, and diagonal <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> boards with quatrefoil fretwork panels at the cornice line. The east wall has a pointed arch recess behind a large pipe organ, which has a curved timber screen {{at the front of}} the organist's seat, which is flanked by pointed arch doorways to the vestry. A low timber and glass narthex has been constructed under the west window between the north and south entry doors, and supports the relocated pulpit rostrum rail. The seating has been rearranged to form a semi-circle facing the south wall of the transept.|$|E

5000|$|Additional {{buildings}} were constructed on the Methodist church's land. These buildings included a cottage and two buildings {{used as a}} shop and a post office. The shop and post office {{buildings were}} rented out from c.1900 to c.1940. A hall, noted for its fine <b>timber</b> <b>lining,</b> was built in 1921. A public swimming pool, built with local volunteer labour, opened in 1957. It was extended in 1980 {{with the addition of}} a tennis court and in 2001 when gas barbeques were added. The pool is a 16 m outdoor pool and is managed by the Caveside Recreation Committee. The shop has long closed but the Caveside memorial hall remains open and is operated by the Meander Valley Council. The Church of Christ formed an organisation in the area in 1909. Prior to this services had been held in Caveside. They built a hand-split timber church building and opened it in 1911. The original building was moved in 1956 and a replacement built. The building is now known as [...] "The Church in the Paddock".|$|E
50|$|The kitchen wing, the {{smallest}} of the three sections of the residence, comprises only two principal rooms and is of similar vertical slab construction, but the vertical slabs in some places are rounded and chamfered at the top and base. The building has a corrugated iron hipped roof, again steeply pitched over the main rooms and more gradual over the front and rear verandahs. An iron ventilator with decorative cap projects through the ridge of the roof. Attached to the south western end of the kitchen is a substantial brick chimney which services the main kitchen oven and a bread oven in that end of the building. The north eastern end of the kitchen wing supports a large climbing plant which, though picturesque, threatens to overtake the building. Internally the kitchen wing has a raked ceiling clad with unpainted cedar beaded boards, a timber boarded floor and an early white lime paint on all internal walls. The door to the kitchen from the north western verandah comprises three adze cut timber slabs, braced on the rear side. Early internal fittings in the kitchen include small cupboards, a long preparation bench, the stove and associated bread stove; and shelving. At the north eastern end of the kitchen block is a small storage room, with raked ceiling, unpainted <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> boards and a boarded floor.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the famous}} {{residents}} (permanent and holiday) of Rosebud were Judith Mavis Cock (Judith Durham), Arthur Boyd and William John Ferrier. Judith spent her first six summers in the weatherboard house that stood {{on the west side}} of Durham Place.It is well documented on many websites that the 1995 Australian of the Year launched his fabulous career as a painter from the age of 16 while living in Rosebud from 1936-9 with his grandfather. One of young Arthur's paintings was of the Burnhams' jetty at the end of Boneo Rd; it is reproduced in Peter Wilson's [...] "On the Road to Rosebud" [...] alongside photos of the jetty. It has recently been discovered through title documents that the Boyd cottage is still standing at 62 Rosebud Pde.Ferrier won acclaim from all over Australia, and probably a job in the lighthouse branch, because of his heroic rescue of two of the seven crewmen of the La Bella at Warrnambool. He owned 858 Pt Nepean Rd for a time before moving to Queenscliff, naming his house in Beach St [...] "Rosebud". A descendant, Lewis Ferrier, jokingly called the Harbour Master at Queenscliff, gave the same name to his fishing boat. The Queenscliffe Maritime Museum website shows some paintings of ships that Ferrier did on the internal <b>timber</b> <b>lining</b> of the South Pile Lighthouse.Two farm homesteads remain among subdivision housing in Rosebud: 19 Mitchell St and 50 First Avenue. The latter was the Hindhope Villa on lots 95 and 96 of the Hindhope Estate (with 14 acres of grounds, as advertised in the Argus in 1914, which the land plan shows was west of Rosebrook St.) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of pollen ratios to {{estimate}} the fluctuations of the late-glacial and holocene tree-limits and the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> is discussed. An attempt is made with fossil data from some sites from {{the eastern part of}} the Pyrenees. Comparisons with the records of Pinus stomata indicating local occurence of Pinus show a good correlation between the two complementary approaches and emphasize the value of the pollen ratio. However, in all cases, the components of the ratio have to be discussed. For reconstructing the <b>timber</b> <b>line,</b> local floristic studies are necessary so that the most appropriate pollen indicators can be chosen...|$|R
