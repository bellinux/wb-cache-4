40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the pattern of ex-ante control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> by mayors under <b>the</b> new <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> system, using <b>the</b> principal-agent theory. In particular, I focus on the council on {{educational}} policy and the educational outline for annual performance in prefectures and designated cities, using an analysis of aggregate data. According to the principal-agent theory, this system gives them a power to control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> by mayors. <b>The</b> following is the finding of this research. In some municipalities, mayors tend to strengthen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education: on <b>the</b> other hand, in the other municipalities, mayors tend to loosen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education.</b> As a result, mayors do not always exert power to control <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education...</b>|$|R

5|$|From the outset, {{the school}} was run as an {{elementary}} school with an infants' department. In 1918, the Fisher Act raised the school leaving age to 14 and many schools subsequently split into junior and senior departments; to accommodate senior children at Sleaford Council School, the County Council proposed formally introducing separate departments, one for infants and junior pupils (those aged below 10), and another for the remaining (senior) pupils. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> approved these plans in 1922. In 1935 the County Council reorganised schooling in Sleaford so that the Council School's senior department received all the town's children in elementary education aged over 10. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> sanctioned these changes {{on the condition that}} new classrooms be added to the Council school to accommodate Senior pupils and a new Infants' department be erected at the site. Financial setbacks and delays over the purchasing of land meant that the new Infants' school was not completed until 1939.|$|E

5|$|Sledd {{played a}} key role in the {{formation}} and ultimate success of the new university, but his time as its president was a relatively short four years. His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected cabinet members, oversaw the Board of Control and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, the Board of Control continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and the Board of Control replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education.</b>|$|E

She served as an officer of the territorial women's suffrage association. Her sister Rose was vice-president of the Utah State Chapter of Women Voters.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of Â£4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck's {{location}} {{at the crossroads}} of river, road, train and other geographical features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries.

In 1965, Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools, after <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> approved a plan to do so by a 7â€“2 vote on May13, 1964.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{building}} {{development was}} completed in 1908, which included converting the chapel back to religious use, a redesigned School Lodge and a block of six classrooms designed by Edward Boardman called the New Buildings. To secure its finances the school accepted a grant from <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> in return for offering 10 percent of its intake to places funded by central government. The First World War saw {{the establishment of an}} Officers Training Corps company associated with the Norfolk Regiment, which disbanded in 1918. Pupil numbers grew steadily to 277 in 1930 and there was further modernisation of the curriculum. During the Second World War several buildings were destroyed in the Baedeker raids on Norwich, while School End House was commandeered by the Auxiliary Territorial Service and the Bishop's Palace was used by the American Red Cross. Inhumations were reportedly disturbed in 1939 when air-raid shelters were being dug on the current site of the playground, previously the old cathedral cemetery. In total, 102 pupils who attended the school died in the two world wars.|$|E
5|$|In April 1888, the Church Board of Education {{was created}} {{as part of}} the LDS Church, {{inspired}} by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887.

This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a board of examiners to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing in the Juvenile Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies.|$|E
