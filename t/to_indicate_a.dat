5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> predator in the air.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:Using only static text messages <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{final phase}} of Zeppelin was codenamed Turpitude, the story for which was an {{overland}} invasion of Greece by British troops via Turkey and the Soviet Union via Bulgaria.

The Allies hoped <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> spoiling attack against the island of Rhodes before the main attack against Salonika. Turpitude finished on 26 June and Zeppelin officially {{came to a close}} on 6 July 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary unit}} of social {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe was the kin group. The mention of descent through the female {{line in the}} ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, {{has led to the}} conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence of awareness of descent through the male line suggests that this more likely <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> bilateral system of descent, where descent was counted through both male and female lines.|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely.

5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When the data collected during this period was analyzed, 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because the data collected on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed very clearly <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E
5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an {{extended}} range forecast for the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral sea surface temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was very accurate in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E

5|$|The large, mostly {{spontaneous}} gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop {{events were}} an important {{sign of a}} change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error {{may have contributed to the}} perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana were {{originally}} {{a branch of}} the Sakalava royal line called the Zafin'i'fotsy (children of silver). This group split off from the Sakalava in the 16th century following a dispute with the Zafin'i'mena (children of gold) that ended with the latter's exclusive right to the kingship. Having been refused the right to the throne, the Zafin'i'fotsy left the Sakalava homeland on the southwestern coast to settle just north of the boundaries of Sakalava control. The first Antankarana king, Kozobe (1614–39), claimed {{a large part of the}} island's north as his territory, which he split into five provinces each ruled by one of his sons. This territory was rapidly reduced from the south by Zafin'i'mena prince Andriamandisoarivo, who led violent campaigns into bordering Antankarana territory to expand the frontiers of what was to become the Sakalava Kingdom of Iboina at the end of the 17th century. Many Zafin'i'fotsy nobles were killed or quickly surrendered to the advancing Sakalava armies, but oral history celebrates several who resisted, including Andriamanpangy, a descendent of Kozobe. His son Andriantsirotso (1692–1710) founded the Antankarana kingdom, leading the Zafin'i'fotsy further north into the area now protected as Ankarana Reserve and declaring his sovereignty over the north. He was accepted as king both by his own people and by the communities already living in the north, who united together under the name Antankarana (people of the Ankarana rocks). The Sakalava warred with the nascent Antankarana kingdom in its continued effort to claim sovereignty over the territory, but the Antankarana hid themselves in natural shelters formed by the rocks and caves of Ankarana. Eventually they were forced to take refuge at Maroantsetra, a town ruled by a relative named Raholo; Andriantsirotso was able to repel the Sakalava three years later with the support of Raholo's soldiers. Throughout this period Andriantsirotso established the foundations for the kingdom by organizing military cooperation among clans, establishing an administration, developing economic regulations and introducing customs that reinforced a hierarchical social order. According to oral history, at the point when Andriantsirotso was preparing to return to his own capital, a mysterious eight-year-old girl named Tsimatahodrafy arrived in Maroantsetra. She revealed herself to be a sorceress and instructed Andriantsirotso on the rituals to perform en route to ensure his safe return and the establishment of a strong kingdom, including the continuing practice of tying a mat to two tsitakonala trees planted outside the king's house <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> royal residence and symbolize the indivisibility of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>a</b> letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E
