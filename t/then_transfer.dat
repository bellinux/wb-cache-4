5|$|This {{may have}} been {{for any number of}} reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on slate, and <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for {{mathematics}} students in the Madras Presidency at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E

50|$|After being {{released}} from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> two electrons from PQH2 to plastocyanin in two separate reactions. The process that occurs {{is similar to the}} Q-cycle in Complex III of the electron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on the lumen side and one electron is transferred to the iron-sulfur center which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to cytochrome f which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to plastocyanin. The second electron is transferred to heme bL which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to heme bH which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized, adding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ.Both reactions together transfer four protons into the lumen.|$|R

25|$|Inoculation {{was already}} a {{standard}} practice, but involved serious risks; among which included the fear that those inoculated would <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> the disease to those around them due to their becoming carriers of the disease.

Voltaire wrote {{that at this time}} 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died of it. Voltaire also states that the Circassians used the inoculation from times immemorial, and the custom may have been borrowed by the Turks from the Circassians.|$|E

25|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{would put on}} their extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) spacesuits and commence the first of five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the ascent stage engine to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would <b>then</b> <b>transfer,</b> along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{takes place}} {{cyclically}} {{in spring and}} summer. Male G. marginata are capable of producing a pheromone which attracts females, although this is only believed to be effective over short distances. They <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> sperm to the female using their gonopods, specially modified legs. After fertilisation, the females lay 70–80 eggs, each about 1mm long, and each wrapped singly in a capsule of digested earth. The eggs hatch {{after a period of}} about two months, with the duration depending on factors including temperature. Development lasts for up to three years, and involves nine moults, following which moults occur periodically as adults. Females are fertile for several years, and can produce six broods over their lifetime, which can be up to eleven years.|$|E

25|$|When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Tromsø served {{briefly as}} {{the seat of}} the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Tromsø on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Tromsø he issued orders for total {{civilian}} and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Trøndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Tromsø escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Tromsøy island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.|$|E
25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
25|$|Because the PSP Go {{does not}} feature a UMD drive, games are {{downloaded}} from the PlayStation Store. While other PSP models {{have included the}} ability to run games and demos downloaded from the PlayStation Store, the PSP Go is the first for which {{this is the only}} means of distribution. The PSP Go has the demo version of Patapon 2 loaded onto the system and it also comes with an ESRB ratings guide, both preloaded into the internal memory in the games section. The removal of the UMD drive effectively region locks the unit due {{to the way in which}} a PSP must be linked to a single PlayStation Network account. Since each account is locked to a single region, this prevents the user from ever playing games from more than one region at a time (since games from accounts other than the currently linked account cannot be started). There are three ways to access the PlayStation Store. The PSP Go can directly download to itself, or users can also download <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> the games from a PlayStation 3 or the Media Go software on Windows based computers. All current downloadable PSP and PlayStation games available for older PSP models are compatible with the PSP Go. Sony has also confirmed that almost all UMD based PSP games released after October 1, 2009 will be available for download, and a majority of older UMD-only games will also be downloadable at that time.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, {{following}} the German invasion of Norway General Fleischer was appointed commander-in-chief of the Norwegian {{armed forces in}} North Norway. At {{the time of the}} attack on 9 April 1940 Fleischer was at Vadsø in Finnmark as part of an inspection journey together with his chief-of-staff, Major Odd Lindbäck-Larsen. When message of the invasion reached him the area {{was in the middle of}} a ferocious blizzard. Due to the extreme weather Fleischer could not leave Vadsø either by Hurtigruten ship or naval aircraft, and had to stay overnight. County Governor of Finnmark Hans Gabrielsen invited Fleischer to stay at the governor's mansion. After discussing the situation with Gabrielsen, Fleischer managed to set off for Tromsø the next day, arriving there by M.F.11 naval aircraft after flying in terrible conditions. From Tromsø he issued orders for a total civilian and military mobilization and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. He handed over most of the civilian powers to the respective County Governors in Troms and Finnmark, Hans Gabrielsen taking all civilian power in Northern Norway after the death of the County Governor of Troms a few days after the invasion. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and <b>then</b> <b>transfer</b> his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Trøndelag. Fleischer valued offensive actions against enemy forces, using the unique nature of the Norwegian terrain to carry out attacks against an enemy's flanks and rear. General Fleischer had already in 1934 opposed the concept of fighting delaying actions while waiting for Allied reinforcements, a tactic on which General Otto Ruge relied during his defence of the vital Eastern Norway region.|$|E
