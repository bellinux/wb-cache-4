5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney {{who claimed to have}} influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Judge</b> <b>was</b> always {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, {{with his}} sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E

25|$|If {{the court}} adopts the real {{likelihood}} test, it will in reality be requiring the complainant {{to show that}} <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> actually biased, though with a lower standard of proof based on a sufficient degree of possibility.|$|E

25|$|The {{ex parte}} {{meeting between the}} trial judge and the jury foreman was improper, and the Court of Appeals would have been {{justified}} in reversing the convictions solely {{because of the risk}} that the foreman believed <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> insisting on a dispositive verdict.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> finally {{declared}} legally dead in 1939 {{thanks to}} Mrs. Crater's lawyer, noted New York attorney Emil K. Ellis. She received $20,561 in life insurance (approximately $ in 2013 dollars). She separated from Kunz in 1950 {{and died in}} 1969 at age 70.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{risk that}} if the real {{likelihood}} test is applied, the court appears to be determining {{that it is possible}} or likely that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> biased. Therefore, the test may lead to dissatisfaction in the administration of justice on the part of members of the public, which is exactly what the doctrine of apparent bias was intended to avoid.|$|E
