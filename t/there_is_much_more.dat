5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E

25|$|Unami is, {{like many}} Algonquian languages, polysynthetic and highly agglutinative.

Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as pneumatophores, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. Fishing cats, macaques, wild boars, common grey mongooses, foxes, jungle cats, flying foxes, pangolins, and spotted deer are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.|$|E

500|$|On the surface, it {{may seem}} that the Smoking Man merely tries to hide {{information}} from Mulder and Scully, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> to him. He {{is involved in the}} Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode [...] "One Breath", he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls [...] "the game") because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: [...] "If people were to know of the things that I know... it would all fall apart". He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the [...] "black oil", a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Greek New Comedy greatly {{differs from}} those plays of Aristophanes. The most notable difference, {{according}} to Dana F. Sutton, is that New Comedy, {{in comparison to}} Old Comedy, is [...] "devoid of a serious political, social or intellectual content" [...] and [...] "could be performed {{in any number of}} social and political settings without risk of giving offense". The risk-taking for which Aristophanes is known is noticeably lacking in the New Comedy plays of Menander. Instead, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> of a focus on the home and the family unit—something that the Romans, including Plautus, could easily understand and adopt for themselves later in history.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{misconception}} is that [...] "it {{is generally}} accepted that natural sources of tropospheric chlorine are {{four to five}} times larger than man-made ones." [...] While strictly true, tropospheric chlorine is irrelevant; it is stratospheric chlorine that affects ozone depletion. Chlorine from ocean spray is soluble and thus is washed by rainfall before it reaches the stratosphere. CFCs, in contrast, are insoluble and long-lived, allowing them to reach the stratosphere. In the lower atmosphere, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> chlorine from CFCs and related haloalkanes than there is in HCl from salt spray, and in the stratosphere halocarbons are dominant. Only methyl chloride, which is one of these halocarbons, has a mainly natural source, and it is responsible for about 20 percent of the chlorine in the stratosphere; the remaining 80 percent comes from manmade sources.|$|E

But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> to the Jewish state than missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that is too often overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel’s parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, {{and a pair of}} dads raising their kids. Lucas also visits Tel Aviv’s vibrant nightlife scene—and even attends a same-sex wedding—in this guided tour of a country that has emerged as a pioneer for gay integration and equality." ...|$|E
