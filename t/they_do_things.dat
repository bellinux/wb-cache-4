[...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
2500|$|The military's {{constitution}} {{passed the}} referendum, {{and a general}} election was held in December 2007. The People's Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) {{refused to accept the}} election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a U.S. press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, [...] "I don't think so. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> for themselves." [...] Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol's role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press. [...] "It is more and more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored", says a Thai academic.|$|E

60|$|The {{whole of}} this {{proceeding}} was regarded with infinite scorn by Navy Bob, who, years before, had been {{captain of the}} foretop on board a line-of-battle ship.

60|$|The {{postcard}} craze {{is dying}} out in Germany--the land of its birth--I am told. In Germany <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> thoroughly, {{or not at}} all.

6000|$|... "Well, {{some time}} I'll tell you. But look here, Mr. Westover, I wish if mother gets {{to talking about}} me with you that you'd let her know how I feel. We can't talk together, she and I, without quarrelling about it; but I guess you could put in a word that would show her I wasn't quite a fool.

6000|$|... "The country classes," [...] said Mr. Paramor quietly, [...] "are {{especially}} {{backward in}} such matters. They have strong, meat-fed instincts, and {{what with the}} county Members, the Bishops, the Peers, all the hereditary force of the country, they still rule the roast. And there's a certain disease--to make a very poor joke, call it 'Pendycitis' with which {{most of these people}} are infected. They're 'crass.' <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> but they do them the wrong way! They muddle through with the greatest possible amount of unnecessary labour and suffering! It's part of the hereditary principle. I haven't had to do with them thirty five years for nothing!" ...|$|E

[...] This term had come up in a recent campaign when some employers, by shutting down their works, were showing their employees {{what would happen if the}} employees voted their political opinions into effect, and Stoller had then mastered its meaning and was fond of using it. [...] "I'd like 'em to see the woods around here, that the city owns, and the springs, and the donkey-carts, and the theatre, and everything, and give 'em some practical ideas." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{people are}} apt to forget this. And {{therefore}} they fall into two mistakes. They think of the Holy Spirit as only a gentle, and {{what they call a}} dove-like being; and they forget what a powerful, awful, literally formidable being He is. They lose respect for the Holy Spirit. They trifle with Him; and while they sing hymns about His gentleness and sweetness, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> which grieve and shock Him; forgetting the awful warning which He, at the very outset of the Christian Church, gave against such taking of liberties with God the Holy Ghost:--how Ananias and Sapphira thought that the Holy Spirit was One whom they might honour with their lips, and more, with their outward actions, but who did not require truth in the inward parts, and did not care for their telling a slight falsehood that they might appear more generous than they really were in the eyes of men; and how the answer of the Holy Spirit of God was that He struck them both dead there and then for a warning to all such triflers, till the end of time.|$|E

6000|$|Takahashi {{laughed with}} me. I {{believed}} he was laughing at what he considered the surprising agility of the squirrel, while I was laughing at him. Here was another manifestation of the Jap's simplicity and capacity. If all Japanese were like Takahashi they were a wonderful people.

It {{seemed to me that}} if a man did not sweat every day, which was to say--labor hard--he very surely was degenerating physically. I could learn a great deal from George Takahashi. Right there I told him that my father had been a famous squirrel hunter in his day. He had such remarkable eyesight that he could espy the ear of a squirrel projecting above the highest limb of a tall white oak. And he was such a splendid shot that he had often [...] "barked" [...] squirrels, as was a noted practice of the old pioneer. I had to explain to Takahashi that this practice consisted of shooting a bullet to hit the bark right under the squirrel, and the concussion would so stun it that it would fall as if dead.|$|E

He was upright, and inflexibly impartial when exercising his magisterial duties at the Assizes and the Sessions.|$|R
