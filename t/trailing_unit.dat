2500|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the M1s {{comprised}} the entire electric fleet, supplemented by 174 new M3 cars between 1985 and 1986. The newer, postwar single-level electric MU cars {{were converted to}} operate behind diesels, joining the postwar diesel-hauled coaches already in that service whose HVAC systems were converted from steam heating to head-end power (HEP). A modified type of push-pull operation {{was introduced to the}} diesel trains, using retired first-generation freight diesels from other railroads (mostly ALCO FAs) converted into control units capable only of HEP generation and controlling the locomotive {{at the other end of}} the train. The first 16 control cabs were created by GE using the last 16 Alco-GE FA-1 and FA-2 units in existence, all of which had been traded in to GE by the last four railroads to operate them: the Penn Central, Louisville & Nashville, Spokane, Portland and Seattle, and Western Maryland. Many of these units survive today in rail museums. New diesels for general use were purchased to replace the LIRR's ALCO Century 420s and other diesels, in the form of GP38-2s and MP15ACs. The latter switchers were innovatively used as [...] "pull-pull" [...] pairs on each end of short off-peak trains on the Oyster Bay Branch and the Greenport shuttle, whereby the leading unit would provide the motive power, and the <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> would supply the train with HEP, the process being reversed at the terminal. By 1973, the LIRR had a completely air-conditioned fleet.|$|E

50|$|On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two {{encodings}} became {{established for}} Japanese and Traditional Chinese {{in which all}} of singletons, lead <b>units</b> and <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively. In Shift-JIS, lead units had the range 81-9F and E0-FC, <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> had the range 40-7E and 80-FC, and singletons had the range 21-7E and A1-DF. In Big5, lead units had the range A1-FE, <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> had the range 40-7E and A1-FE, and singletons had the range 21-7E (all values in hexadecimal). This overlap again made processing tricky, though at least most of the symbols had unique byte values (though strangely the backslash does not).|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{the four}} {{character}} string [...] "I♥NY" [...] is encoded in UTF-8 like this (shown as hexadecimal byte values): 49 E2 99 A5 4E 59. Of the six units in that sequence, 49, 4E, and 59 are singletons (for I, N, and Y), E2 is a lead unit and 99 and A5 are <b>trail</b> <b>units.</b> The heart symbol {{is represented by}} the combination of the lead unit and the two <b>trail</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|The final fleet {{included}} 13x 102 hp engine/driving units 1-13RM and 16x 153 hp engine/driving units 20-35RM {{which looked}} similar; these shared 27x <b>trailing</b> <b>units</b> each mounted {{on only one}} bogie, and attached semi-permanently to the associated motor unit, leaving one motor unit of each type spare. The <b>trailing</b> <b>units</b> were not identified normally when in service, but some correspondence notes individual identities No.100 to No.111 (or No.101 to No.112) and No.220 to No.234. This was marked on a small plate on the passenger/driver door of cabs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a TGV Atlantique {{are already}} quite good, and improvements were few. It {{was decided that}} 325 would have a [...] "front" [...] and [...] "rear" [...] for the high-speed runs, to simplify the modifications. Usually a TGV trainset is symmetric and reversible, but 325's two power cars, 24049 and 24050, were defined as leading and trailing units, respectively. On the roof of lead unit 24049, the pantographs were removed and the roof fairing extended over the opening; the same was done to the 1500 V DC pantograph on <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> 24050. Only one pantograph was to be used at high speed: the stock Faiveley GPU unit remaining on unit 24050. As in normal TGV running, the lead unit was to be fed power from the <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> through the roof line running {{the length of the}} train. Further improvements, such as rubber membranes covering the gaps between the trailers, and a rear spoiler on the <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> were considered, but abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The Unicode {{standard}} has two variable-width encodings: UTF-8 and UTF-16 (it {{also has}} a fixed-width encoding, UTF-32). Originally, both Unicode and ISO 10646 standards {{were meant to be}} fixed-width, with Unicode being 16 bit and ISO 10646 being 32 bit. ISO 10646 provided a variable-width encoding called UTF-1, in which singletons had the range 00-9F, lead units the range A0-FF and <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> the range A0-FF and 21-7E. Because of this bad design, parallel to Shift-JIS and Big5 in its overlap of values, the inventors of the Plan 9 operating system, the first to implement Unicode throughout, abandoned it and replaced it with a much better designed variable-width encoding for Unicode: UTF-8, in which singletons have the range 00-7F, lead units have the range C0-FD (now actually C2-F4, to avoid overlong sequences and to maintain synchronism with the encoding capacity of UTF-16; see UTF-8 article), and <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> have the range 80-BF. The lead unit also tells how many <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> follow: one after C2-DF, two after E0-EF and three after F0-F4.|$|R

50|$|UTF-16 was {{devised to}} break free of the 65,536-character limit of the {{original}} Unicode (1.x) without breaking compatibility with the 16-bit encoding. In UTF-16, singletons have the range 0000-D7FF (55296 codepoints) and E000-FFFF (8192 codepoints, 63488 in total), lead units the range D800-DBFF (1024 codepoints) and <b>trail</b> <b>units</b> the range DC00-DFFF (1024 codepoints, 2048 in total). The lead and <b>trail</b> <b>units,</b> called in Unicode terminology high surrogates and low surrogates respectively, map 1024×1024 or 1,048,576 numbers, making for a maximum of possible 1,114,112 (1,048,576 codepoints represented by high and low surrogate pairs + 63488 BMP codepoints + 2048 surrogate codepoints) codepoints in Unicode, of which 1,112,064 codepoints are valid in other encodings: UTF-8, UTF-32, where there surrogate pair ranges are not required and forbidden to be used.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{gap between}} power cars and trailers, large airdams were installed. These [...] "snow shields", mounted beneath the couplers, were {{designed}} to prevent {{the formation of a}} low pressure area between the vehicles, which had induced significant drag in the earlier testing. On the power cars, sheet metal shields were added over the trucks, and the front airdam was extended downwards by 10 cm (4 in) to compensate for the larger wheels. Finally, a removable spoiler was installed on the nose of <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> 24050.|$|E

These four locomotives were repainted by Canadian Pacific in standard colors following the filming, but the painted pilot warning stripes from the AWVR livery were left untouched and remained visible on the locomotives.

5000|$|Because {{they were}} always run coupled together, Santa Fe {{employees}} nicknamed the two units the [...] "One Spot Twins" [...] and [...] "Amos & Andy" [...] (after the popular radio situation comedy). Both units shared a common road number and the operating department considered them a single locomotive. The mechanical department referred to them as Unit A (lead unit) and Unit B (<b>trailing</b> <b>unit).</b> While the pair substituted for a Super Chief E1 set with burned-out traction motors in 1937, the company leased EMC demonstrator #512 as a third unit called Unit C.|$|E

5000|$|The classic farm tractor is {{a simple}} open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and {{slightly}} behind a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine {{in front of the}} driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort. In some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [...] "Caterpillar" [...] or [...] "crawler" [...] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.Four-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard [...] "two large, two small" [...] configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> is not steered separately.In the early 21st century, articulated or nonarticulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.|$|E
40|$|Angle {{of attack}} is an {{important}} wheel-rail contact parameter. It serves for estimation of the rolling stock curving performance. Together with wheel-rail contact forces, angle of attack influences the wear index. This paper presents experimental on-track measurements of the angle of attack using a specially designed laser device installed on track.

40|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} road freight {{transport}} necessitate the {{development and use of}} fuel-ecient and economic transport vehicles and solutions. The transition from standard tractor-semitrailer combinations to truck and trailer combinations of gross combination weights upto 74 tons and extending upto 34 metres in length is in eect {{at the time of this}} research. Also, there is growing impetus for hybridisation and complete electrication of medium and heavy duty long haul trucks. Yet, the pertinent problem is the study of the economic and technical feasibility of such hybridisation for longer combinations where there can be several potential axles that can be electrically propelled. The problem is further compounded by the challenges and costs faced in using currently-expensive and heavy batteries and a variety of electric motors. In this thesis, a generic physical modelling of long truck trailer combinations coupled with an energy management algorithm is developed. The energy management is made predictive in nature with prior knowledge of the mission route in order to optimise the use of the electric batteries. The propulsion is 'distributed' so as to allow each <b>trailing</b> <b>unit</b> to be independent, complete with its own battery and axle power distribution management. Thereafter, an object-oriented programming architecture is constructed to implement the vehicle model. The A-Double combination is instantiated and validated against a physical test vehicle performing transport missions along Malmo and Goteborg in south-western Sweden. Independently, a genetic algorithm is implemented on the same platform as the vehicle model. The genotype structures corresponding to each long vehicle combination to be evaluated are developed and custom cross-over and mutation schemes are described and implemented. The algorithm is validated for standard benchmarking functions in two variables and for simple arithmetic functions involving the categorical variables representing the truck-trailer combinations. Several objective functions for the long vehicle combinations are evaluated and a prot maximisation objective is chosen and mathematically formulated. The function parameters are varied to evaluate function sensitivity to each. The genetic algorithm is then used to derive the optimal axle propulsion conguration, battery size and motor rating for the mission specied above, with varying gross combination weights so as to maximise the chosen objective function. Trends in vehicle productivity are calculated over 15 following years from 2015 to 2030 and optimal long combination congurations are derived in intervals of 5 years. Principal contributing factors in each optimal conguration are identied and discussed...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the aim of}} a multibyte {{encoding}} {{system is}} to minimise changes to existing application software, some characters must retain their pre-existing single-unit codes, even while other characters have multiple units in their codes. The result {{is that there are}} three sorts of units in a variable-width encoding: singletons, which consist of a single unit, lead units, which come first in a multiunit sequence, and <b>trail</b> <b>units,</b> which come afterwards in a multiunit sequence. Input and display software obviously needs to know about the structure of the multibyte encoding scheme but other software generally doesn't need to know if a pair of bytes represent two separate characters or just one character.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of multibyte {{encodings}} was for the encoding of Chinese, Japanese and Korean, which have large character sets well in excess of 256 characters. At first the encoding was constrained to the limit of 7 bits. The ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-KR encodings used the range 21-7E (hexadecimal) for both lead <b>units</b> and <b>trail</b> <b>units,</b> and marked them off from the singletons by using ISO 2022 escape sequences to switch between single-byte and multibyte mode. A total of 8,836 (94×94) characters could be encoded at first, and further sets of 94×94 characters with switching. The ISO 2022 encoding schemes for CJK are still in use on the Internet. The stateful nature of these encodings and the large overlap make them very awkward to process.|$|R
