5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played {{an important part in}} the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> out of the region.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, {{the bells}} of San Fernando sounded the alarm of the {{approach}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> Travis ordered all the Texan forces into the Alamo. James Bowie hurried to gather provisions and herd cattle into the Alamo compound.|$|E
5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas de México) are {{composed}} of two independent entities: <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Army and <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Navy. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Army includes <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Air Force (FAM). The Presidential Guard, Military Police, and Special Forces {{are part of the}} Army, but have their own chains of command. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Navy includes <b>the</b> Naval Infantry Force and the Naval Aviation (FAN).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Armed Forces {{have two}} branches: <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Army (which {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Air Force), and <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Navy. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including facilities for design, research, {{and testing of}} weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels, defense systems and electronics; military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Drug War (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> War on Drugs; [...] ) is <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> theater of <b>the</b> United States' War on Drugs, {{involving}} an ongoing low-intensity asymmetric war between <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Government and various drug trafficking syndicates. Since 2006, when <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> military began to intervene, the government's principal goal {{has been to}} reduce the drug-related violence. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing drug trafficking, which is left to U.S. functionaries.|$|R
5|$|Fannin {{had begun}} {{evacuating}} Presidio La Bahía on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low {{on food and}} water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at Coleto Creek, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20. Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and {{claimed to have been}} held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was a spy for <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b>|$|E
5|$|May's {{squadron}} {{was attached}} as a direct-reporting unit {{to the newly}} promoted General Twiggs' 1st Texas Division, {{which was to be}} committed to the north side of Monterrey. On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster, and after some intense urban fighting, General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{operated}} as {{an autonomous}} power inside the area claimed by Spain but not controlled by it. The Comanches used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans,</b> and Indians through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings, and the Spanish could {{do little to}} stop them because the Comanches controlled most of the horses {{in the region and}} thus had more wealth and mobility. Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanches created a centralized political system, based on a foraging market economy, and a hierarchical social organization.|$|E

5|$|The {{steamboat}} Yellowstone {{under the}} command of Captain John Eautaw Ross was impressed into service for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and initially ferried patients across the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps established a field hospital at Bernardo Plantation. Three days later, Santa Anna joined with Sesma's troops, and had them build flatboats to cross the Brazos as <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> sought to overtake and defeat the Texians. Wyly Martin reported on April 8 that Mexican forces had divided and were headed both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda. Houston reinforced Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9, as Santa Anna continued moving southeast on April 10.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man.

I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had intervened {{repeatedly}} in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1915 Mexican insurgents {{raided the}} Texas border region {{as part of}} the Plan of San Diego. Supported by the Mexican Carranza government, a group of raiders known as the Seditionistas {{attacked}} American military and commercial interests along the United States–Mexican border in an effort to provoke a race war in the Southwestern United States with aims of returning the area to Mexican control. Charged with guarding the border, American General Frederick Funston had 20,000 troops to pit against the few hundred Seditionista insurgents. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> never raided in force and the long border was difficult for Funston to fully protect. The Seditionista raids became such a threat to the Americans in the Big Bend area that local vigilante groups were formed in order to repel the Mexican raiders as Funston did not have enough troops {{to ensure the safety of}} the American citizens living in the area.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|With {{the victory}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> over the Spanish {{imperial}} army in 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain came to a conclusion. The newly independent Mexican Congress still desired that King Ferdinand VII, or {{another member of the}} House of Bourbon, agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico, thereby forming a type of personal union with Spain. The Spanish monarchy, however, refused to recognise the new state, and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. Thus, the Mexican Agustín de Iturbide was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822, with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following. Only a few months later, Augustine dissolved a factious congress, thereby prompting an enraged Antonio López de Santa Anna to mount a coup, which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822. In order to end the unrest, Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country, and the Mexican monarchy was abolished. After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication, Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824, but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and, without trial, was executed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Smith and rising {{opposition}} in the west, the Mormons decided to relocate their center from Nauvoo, Illinois to the California region outside of the United States border. The plans for the large exodus began and Mormon leadership moved westward leaving Brannan the highest ranking religious leader in New York. As such, he was faced with the large responsibility of evacuating the eastern Mormons to California. Brannan chartered the ship Brooklyn and persuaded the Mormons of New York to join the expedition to California. The Brooklyn set sail for upper California via Cape Horn in January 1846. Brannan {{was in charge of}} the expedition and the highest presiding religious leader on the ship. He brought along an antiquated printing press and a complete flour mill to make colonization easier. While the living conditions aboard the Brooklyn were strenuous for many, Brannan lived lavishly in the ship's officers' quarters. The ship stopped on June 20, 1846 in Honolulu, Hawaii to resupply and be inspected by Commodore Stockton. Brannan expected the inspection to go badly but instead Commodore Stockton spoke to Brannan about the United States planned assault of <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> at Monterey. This information along with Commodore Stockton's quiet encouragement lead Samuel Brannan to the idea of taking the port town of Yerba Buena. Brannan's dreams of colonization and success were underway and after leaving Hawaii, the Brookyln changed routes, landing on July 31, 1846, at the Mexican port town of Yerba Buena. Upon arrival they were met by Commander John B. Montgomery and the Portsmouth who had taken Yerba Buena only a few days before much to Brannan's dismay. The Mormons began colonizing the area (present-day San Francisco) and tripled the population of the pueblo.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Madeira and Jamaica, {{the ship}} arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, on 9 February to relieve her sister ship, , and protect British {{interests}} during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Two weeks later, she visited Galveston, Texas, before heading for Tampico, Mexico where she arrived on 11 March. Essex only {{spent a few}} days there before returning to Veracruz on 13 March. She was in Tampico when Mexican soldiers briefly detained American sailors buying gasoline for their ship on 9 April (the Tampico Affair) and returned to Veracruz ten days later, {{two days before the}} Americans began landing there on 21 April. They were not satisfied by the Mexican apologies and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the city occupied in retribution and to forestall a major arms delivery to Victoriano Huerta's forces. <b>The</b> <b>Mexicans</b> resisted and stray bullets hit Essex the next day, wounding one man who was shot in both feet. Tweedie, escorted by two ratings, was sent to take dispatches for the British Minister in Mexico City on the 26th and returned two days later. Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock inspected the ship and her crew on 5–6 May. Essex sailed for Tampico on 10 May before leaving Mexican waters on the 14th. A month later, the ship was in Quebec City when she was visited by the Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries on 16 June. The following month, Essex ferried the Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Newfoundland and Labrador before returning to Quebec City on 20 July.|$|E
