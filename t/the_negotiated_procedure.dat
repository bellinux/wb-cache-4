In 2000, the European Commission published an [...] "interpretative communication on concessions under Community law", and in 2004 it published a [...] "Green Paper on public-private partnerships and Community law on public contracts and concessions", which takes stock of existing practices from the perspective of European law and is intended to launch a debate on whether a specific legal framework should be drawn up at the European level.The competitive dialogue was created with the aim of making the award of public-private partnerships easier, since before its creation, a Contracting Authority faced the choice of the restricted procedure, which is often too inflexible for such contracts, or <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is intended to be an exceptional procedure with specific legal justifications.

The procedure may be applied in exceptional situations of extreme urgency resulting from an event {{which could not be}} foreseen. The current judicature of the Court of Justice of the EU provides interpretations of the legal basis for application of the procedure in specific cases. However, it does not address the issue of whether it is possible to regard improper performance of contractual obligations as unpredictable. It does not provide broader considerations concerning the form of regulations on the procedure of awarding public interest contracts either. These issues were subject to analysis in one of the resolutions of the National Appeal Chamber (KIO) – the Polish authority issuing decisions in matters related to public procurement contracts.

KIO found that the significant delay in construction of the facility was unpredictably exceptional, and significantly threatened the timeliness of commissioning the facility, which resulted in termination of the agreement by the contracting authority. The resolution also included an assessment allowing for the position that such a situation was exceptional due to the scale of the threat to the public interest, including the commercial interest of the contracting authority, stemming from a lack of immediate performance of the contract if it resulted in disproportionate consequences for a specific community. The issue of acceptance of such an interpretation by EU institutions remains unresolved...|$|E

This thesis covers four studies in which different aspects of negotiated assessment were examined. Its aim was to gain more knowledge about a <b>negotiated</b> assessment <b>procedure</b> to promote teacher learning in the area of stimulating students’ reflections. The results show that very little negotiation took place during the dialogues. Despite the lack of negotiation during the assessment meetings, the teachers reported a strong sense of agency.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{based primarily on}} transaction costs, for comparing the various tendering mechanisms used for transportation Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, the model contrasts negotiated procedures with the open procedure, {{as defined by the}} current European Union legislation on public tendering. The model includes both ex ante transaction costs (borne during the tendering stage) and ex post transaction costs (such as enforcement costs, re-negotiation costs, and costs arising from litigation between partners), explaining the trade-off between them. Generally speaking, it is assumed that the open procedure implies lower transaction costs ex ante, while <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> reduces the probability of the appearance of new contingencies not foreseen in the contract, hence diminishing the expected value of transaction costs ex post. Therefore, the balance between ex ante and ex post transaction costs is the main criterion for deciding whether the open or negotiated procedure would be optimal. Notwithstanding, empirical evidence currently exists only on ex ante transaction costs in transportation infrastructure projects. This evidence has shown a relevant difference between the two procedures as far as ex ante costs are concerned, favouring the open procedure. The model developed in this paper also demonstrates that a larger degree of complexity in a contract does not unequivocally favour the use of a negotiated procedure. Only in those cases dealing with very innovative projects, where important dimensions {{of the quality of the}} asset or service are not verifiable, may we observe an advantage in favour of <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure.</b> The bottom line is that we find it difficult to justify the employment of negotiated procedures in most transportation PPP contracts, especially in the field of roads. Nevertheless, the field remains open for future empirical work and research on the levels of transaction costs borne ex post in PPP contracts, as well as on the probabilities of such costs appearing under any of the procurement procedures...|$|E

40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a restrictive force on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: competitive dialogue, <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the open and restricted procedures and the possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the possible ways of implementing WAN networks over ATM networks. The first part is a presentation of the various standardised network data protocols for the transfer of data on public data networks and their relation to ATM. We quickly come to the realisation that the predominant protocol is currently the TCP/IP, which is also used on the known computer network, the Internet. This is followed by an analysis of overhead information, which is added by the ATM Adaptation Layer. Of special interest in data transfer are AAL 3 / 4 and AAL 5 protocols. ATM has at the moment defined adaptive classes of services: CBR, VBR, ABR and UBR. For data transfer, class ABR will be used mainly. As we have already mentioned, the TCP/IP is at present predominant. In the third chapter, we analyse the transfer of TCP/IP packets over a pilot ATM network. Particularly painful is the realisation that the loss of a single cell during transmission (usually due to a breach of <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure)</b> requires that we retransmit the whole packet. In spite of all its weaknesses, the TCP/IP will remain the most widespread protocol, though some correction will be necessary. Most of the findings also hold true for other protocols, like Frame Relay. The next chapter is on researching methods of allocating virtual paths in the ATM network. As long as ATM networks will be used merely for connecting LAN networks and as long as the ATM network is small in size, no problems are to be expected. The topic will gain in importance on the appearance of other larger commercial providers of ATM networks who will also provide other services, for example, speech transmission, video transmission, etc [...] Our virtual path allocation proposal is a compromise between the use of virtu [...] ...|$|E

On an N-period time horizon, should he follow several short-run {{objectives}} for every n sub-period, or should he consider only the long-run objective? If a European manager trying {{to implement a}} stock recovery plan prefers to achieve the long-run objective as rapidly as possible, will the member-state governments follow the same guideline with their own goals? They may prefer a shorter horizon matching their own political cycle. Suppose the European Commissioner wants to reduce the fishing capacity within five years along a monotonic decommissioning scheme, one of the member-states might keep on fishing with {{the same level of}} effort for one or two years before reducing its fishing fleet. On the basis of a non-cooperative game, this communication looks at the role of a mediator (say the European Commissioner in charge of <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> sharing of fish quotas between the member states) whose goal is twofold: the recovery of fish stocks and the search for optimal solutions between member-states having different discount rates and different catch levels.

40|$|How {{should the}} issue of {{domestic}} labor standards be handled in the GATT/ WTO? This question {{is part of a}} broader debate over the appropriate scope of international economic institutions such as the GATT, where member-countries are considering proposals for a new round of n 3 negotiations that would move beyond GATT's focus on trade barriers and cover domestic' issues such as labor and environmental standards and regulatory reform which have traditionally been treated with benign neglect' within GATT. Such proposals encroach on traditional limits of national sovereignty, and they raise fundamental challenges to the existing structure of international economics relations among sovereign states. In this paper we consider several approaches to the treatment of domestic labor standards within a trade agreement. We use simple economic arguments to show that, while the benign neglect of labor standards within a trade agreement will result in inefficient choices for both trade barriers and labor standards, direct negotiations over labor standards are not required to reach efficient outcomes. Specifically, we describe two tafiff negotiating structures that deliver efficient outcomes while preserving varying degrees of national sovereignty over policy choices. A first approach combines tariff negotiations with subsequent Kemp-Wan adjustments, under which each government is free to alter unilaterally its policy mix so long as trade volumes are not affected. A second approach adds to the first, under which afte tariff negotiations each governement can alter unilaterally its tariff, but its trading partner is then free to issue a tariff response to stabilize export prices. We show that both approaches deliver govts. to the efficiency frontier but that the second approach provides govts. with greater sovereignty over policy choices and bears a strong resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>procedures</b> in G...|$|R
40|$|For several {{historical}} and political reasons, the decision-making processes and institutional structures of environmental governance {{has been greatly}} impacted by the North-South dimension, which creates enormous challenges for Southern states {{when they try to}} present their concerns to global forums. These challenges have many dimensions, such as political, economic, social, and legal. This thesis recognises the "poverty of influence" that has become endemic {{as a result of the}} lack of resources, expertise, research facilities, technology and other practical deficiencies that exist in <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>procedures</b> and which have hampered the South's participation in global environmental governance. Such participatory inequalities between North and South have seriously hampered the application of equity, fairness and justice - principles that are considered to be vital ingredients in any balanced governing system. This thesis proposes the utilisation of the diverse capacity of transnational NGO networks to enable the Southern voice to be effectively heard in global decision-making processes, and it questions the traditional legal structures that currently allow for NGO involvement by determining the need for wider opportunities to be considered, thereby enabling them to express their concerns. The thesis includes a Case Study that examines from a North-South perspective the detterent capacities of NGOs to influence global forests negotiations. Consequently, it is hoped that the thesis will contribute towards a greater understanding of the benefits that might accrue from the utilisation of transnational networks to voice hitherto unheard global forest issues. This thesis, which is timely, in that 20 II was the International Year of Forests, argues that transnational NGO networks could help mitigate the inequalities suffered by the South caused by the historic North-South divide. However, it also stresses the importance attached to transnational NGO networks incorporating measurable values of legitimacy and accountability when they represent the South at global governance forums.

The integration style of this region reflected the protected development models of the period, and developed slowly during the years 1960 - 1980. The period 1980 - 1990, known as the lost decade" in Latin America, is then examined, bringing to light {{on the one hand}} the retreat of economic integration in the region and on the other the beginnings of a process of political democratization which was to set the stage for renewed progress towards integration in the following decade. The second section examines the concept of open regionalism. Firstly, a brief account is given of the main features of the globalization process and of its counterpart at the national level, characterized by development styles that centre around trade liberalization, stabilization, privatization and deregulation of economic processes. This is followed by an outline of the concept of open Latin American regionalism consistent with the ground rules of global multilateralism. Thirdly, evidence is brought forward to show how integrationist initiatives have been extended to the hemisphere as a whole due to the growing involvement of the United States in the construction of free trade areas. Finally, a distinction is drawn between agreements that confine themselves to constructing free trade areas and those that seek to progress towards the stage of customs unions and common markets. The third section examines <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>procedures</b> and <b>the</b> type of undertakings involved in the Free Trade Agreements that have been signed up to in the hemisphere. The fourth section looks at regional and inter-regional free trade agreements in the 1990 s. The fifth section describes how negotiations are conducted and what type of agreements are contained in those subregional integration schemes of Latin America and the Caribbean that have the objective of setting up customs unions and common markets. The sixth and final section attempts to draw some conclusions about the role which regional integration processes play or could play in strengthening trading and economic relationships on the south-south axis and in enabling common negotiating positions to be established and consolidated on the north-south axis. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{the characteristics of}} the nursing labour market in which the National Health Service operated from 1948 until I 983 and presents econometric estimates of the supply functions of nursing staff. The monopsony of the central government in the market for nurses permits it to depress the pay of nurses. Together with the peculiar budgeting system of the N. H. S., this resulted in a 'shortage' of nurses, in the economic sense of excess demand, from 1948 until 1976, when the market became demand constrained Until 1976, the number of nurses employed was determined by supply. This permits the observed number of nurses employed by the N. H. S. until I 976 to be treated as observations on a supply function. The time series of observations until I 976 is used to estimate supply functions for six different groups of nursing staff employed in non-psychiatric hospitals in England and wales. These groups are: whole-time and part-time Registered Nurses: whole-time and part-time Enrolled Nurses: whole-time and part-time Nursing Auxiliaries, These six groups are distinct in their response to pay and other factors affecting nurse labour supply. Separate consideration is given to nurse training. Entry to student and pupil nurse training is considered separately. Econometric estimates of the impact of pay, unemployment and the number of young women in the population on entry to nurse training are presented.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{improved}} insights into the contracting process for construction projects that the military contract out to civil contractors in the specific setting of civil–military interaction (CMI) in regions that are suffering from instability and armed conflict. The core questions are: what are the key criteria for contracting out CMI projects in out‐of‐area operations, and what contracting methods are appropriate? First, we discuss possible methods and key criteria for contracting out CMI projects. Following this, a case study based in the Uruzgan province of Afghanistan explores key criteria for contracting out CMI projects. Based on this case study, the following five CMI‐related criteria have been identified: generating information on the civilian environment; contributing to building local capacity; process transparency; force acceptance and local participation; and contracting as a tool for stability. These criteria dominate more regular criteria such as cost and time. Some methods frequently used in developed economies, for example the open public tender procedure, seem less appropriate when contracting out CMI projects within a military mission.

Methods: An interview study with 32 adults in England and Scotland (part of a larger study).   Findings: Five themes describe the core experiences of this group of bereaved people: drug use, the death, official processes, stigma, and overdose awareness and prevention. Together, these findings offer new insights in to the key features of this type of bereavement; for example, living with substance use including previous overdoses, difficult circumstances surrounding the death, having to <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> complex <b>procedures</b> involved in processing the death, the stigma such deaths attract, and feelings of guilt, self-blame and an unworthiness to grieve.

3000|$|The {{information}} on <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> and residual {{part of the}} wage also allows us to investigate whether an increase in <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> wage induces firms to adjust the other component of the wage. The red line in Figs.  11 and 12 represents <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> part of <b>the</b> wages. Note that due to the institutional setting, the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> part of <b>the</b> wages is sticky as it is usually predetermined for 3  years. As a result <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> part of <b>the</b> wages continued to rise even during years of economic downturn (grey area). 16 However, a simple graphical inspection {{of the evolution of}} <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> (red line) and residual (black line) part of the wages shows that in 2009 and in 2014, firms compensated for the increase of <b>the</b> <b>negotiated</b> part of <b>the</b> wages by reducing the residual component. 17 [...]...|$|R

Using healthcare facilities data on procurement contracts, I find evidence that auctions do not yield lower prices than negotiations. This result is robust to specifications tackling quality differences, endogenous participation, and the bilateral and multilateral nature of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures.</b> I also find evidence that late payments reduce competition and thus affect firms’ participation choices. A simple test based on Benford’s Law is used to rule out collusion among participants as a possible explanation of the results.

The author argues that in fact the NLRA was drafted, and for a time implemented, with the avowed purpose of giving workers equality with employers in all aspects of industrial policy making, and that the now-prevalent approach became ascendant only after considerable conflict and the displacement of the Act 2 ̆ 7 s original administrators...|$|R
