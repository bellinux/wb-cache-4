5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

25|$|Development was resumed in {{all areas}} of the country, {{including}} the hitherto neglected and largely undeveloped semi-arid or arid north. Many sectors of the economy recovered from total collapse pre-2003. Numerous state corporations that had collapsed during the Moi years were revived and have begun performing profitably. The telecommunications sector boomed. Rebuilding, modernisation and expansion of infrastructure began in earnest, with several ambitious infrastructural and other projects, such as the Thika Superhighway, which would have been seen as unattainable pipe dreams during <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> and largely stagnant Moi years, completed. The country's cities and towns also began being positively renewed and transformed.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{anticipated}} {{expansion of the}} navy, the IJN originally issued numerical designations to every ship. However, <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> numerical designations were unpopular with the officers and crews. The IJN abolished destroyers' numerical designations in August 1928, reverting to names. The reverence held by the Japanese for the arts of war, promoted by the pre-war military governments, led to poetic sounding names for warships. Destroyers were allocated names associated with natural phenomena of weather, sky and sea, e.g., wind (kaze), snow (yuki), rain (ame), clouds (kumo), waves (nami), mist (kiri), frost (shimo), tides (shio), and the moon (tsuki).|$|E

Furthermore, there is a duty upon medical professionals to keep patients alive unless to do so would be contrary to the patient's best interests based on professional medical opinion (the Bolam Test), taking into account their quality of life in the event that treatment is continued. The Abortion Act 1967 permits the termination of a pregnancy under certain conditions and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requires the storage of embryos to be licensed.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (Stéphane Audran) {{appears at}} their door. She carries only {{a letter from}} Papin, {{explaining}} {{that she is a}} refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris, and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation, and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice; Babette tells no one that she is spending her entire winnings on the meal.|$|E

Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, he joined the Vegetarian Society, was elected to its executive committee, and started a local Bayswater chapter.

500|$|Presley {{made his}} {{third and final}} Ed Sullivan Show {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley [...] "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> clothes he had worn {{on the first two}} shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out." [...] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, [...] "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley [...] "a real decent, fine boy".|$|E
500|$|Touch Arcade {{called the}} {{graphics}} [...] "good, but not great", though reasonable given the game's age, but that some demon designs were [...] "spectacular works of art".

They did however like the graphics used in battles and story sections, which they found well-drawn and detailed. They praised the designs of the game's female characters, especially Nekomata, Lamia, and Yuriko, but felt that the designs of the male characters were bland. Touch Arcade found the music to be fantastic. RPGFan said that every piece fits into the scene where it is played, but that few were memorable. They did note [...] "Ginza" [...] as an exception, which they felt was so well-composed that it would sound good in any format.|$|E

500|$|In the Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath (2000), Pfeiffer starred with Harrison Ford as a well-to-do {{couple who}} {{experience}} a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past.

She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a [...] highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), opposite Sean Penn. Despite grossing $97.8 million worldwide, the movie received unfavorable reviews; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: [...] "Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> clichés that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever". Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: [...] "In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life.

500|$|Reviews of Tribunal were {{generally}} positive, though to lesser amounts {{than was the}} case for Morrowind. Aggregate scoring sites gave the game generally favourable scores: Metacritic, a score of 80; GameRankings, a score of 82. Most critics commented on the greater linearity of the experience, combined with a reduction in the total size of the play area, giving the changes mixed reviews. GameSpot reported sullenly on the change: [...] "it's somewhat surprising that the Tribunal expansion confines your adventures to the relatively small setting of the municipality Mournhold," [...] and that, in light of this change, [...] "Tribunal doesn't have many of the features that made Morrowind so appealing." [...] IGN stated that although [...] "you'll rarely lose sight of what you're doing or why," [...] a fact that may make the game more [...] "comprehensible" [...] for some players, [...] "the lack of interaction {{with the rest of the}} world is pretty depressing." [...] RPGamer, by contrast, was unequivocally positive about the change: [...] "Bethesda ... neatly sidesteps two of the most difficult atmospheric flaws of Morrowind—the constant sense of emptiness, and <b>the</b> <b>bland</b> outdoor landscapes—by having the story take place entirely within the city of Mournhold .... This smaller, tighter playing field ensures that every minor detail can and does get attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Koubek's D.C. area output slowed in {{the late}} 1960s. In February 1967, the Bureau of National Affairs (a privately held {{publisher}} of government news) commissioned him to design a six-story Modernist building at 1231 25th Street NW. (This glass-and-white concrete neo-Brutalist building was stripped to its frame in 2007, four floors added, and joined to both an existing and a new structure to create luxury apartments.) In October 1967, construction began on his design for 1401 I Street NW, west of Franklin Square. (<b>The</b> <b>bland</b> glass-and-steel box underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 1991. It was given a postmodern facade of finished grey concrete panels and brown granite, the center portion of the building on {{the south and east}} sides extended slightly outward to break up the flatness of the building, and twin giant six-story-high non-structural Doric columns topped by a non-structural colonnade and entablature. The building is now called Franklin Tower.) In December 1967, Koubek designed a new home for the Motion Picture Association of America at 1601 I Street NW, described as a [...] "bronze-tinted glass box on stilts enclosed by a bold screen of tan concrete". Another critic later called it [...] "elegant" [...] and as good as the work of I. M. Pei.
