5|$|A hydro-electric {{scheme was}} built in 2016 on Radyr Weir to {{generate}} renewable energy. The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per year <b>through</b> <b>two</b> screw turbines {{and is expected to}} generate 400kW — enough energy to power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E

Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city <b>through</b> <b>two</b> main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction <b>through</b> <b>two</b> player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E

The design of the memorial was selected <b>through</b> <b>two</b> architectural competitions. The first competition, in 1924, produced 26 designs—all of which were lost before judging could be completed after fire destroyed the building in which they were housed. A second competition, in 1926, produced 18 entries, out of which the design by the architectural firm Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne-Smith was selected as the winner.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Richard {{attempted}} a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke had slowed down his reaction time and weakened his depth perception.

After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went <b>through</b> <b>two</b> divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994.

5|$|Millipedes breathe <b>through</b> <b>two</b> {{pairs of}} spiracles located ventrally on each segment {{near the base}} of the legs.

The excretory organs are two pairs of malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5|$|Moulds {{are built}} <b>through</b> <b>two</b> main methods: {{standard}} machining and EDM.
