40|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Lisbon Agenda in 2000, the European Union established for itself the ambitious goal of becoming the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world by 2010. Despite initial optimism, {{the first half of the}} decade has been dispiriting and targets established under the Lisbon strategy will be difficult to achieve. Many observers have concluded that governments have failed to implement the policies required to achieve these targets and that, without radical changes, the strategy will fail to deliver its promises. Without disagreeing with these conclusions, the present paper argues that they portray the situation excessively negatively. Using cross-country structural indicators compiled by the OECD, it shows that changes have occurred during the first half of the Lisbon programme, although not everywhere. The first part of the paper reviews recent developments in indicators of labour market policies and labour market performance. It shows that structural policies have moved in the right direction in several countries, notably <b>tax</b> <b>wedges</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> income for low-wage earners and the implicit tax on continued work. This has been associated with a somewhat better labour market performance, notably higher employment rates. As well, the easing of product market regulation, which is deemed to increase the competitive pressure felt by firms and incite them to invest and innovate, has been associated with faster productivity growth in some countries and some industries. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of performance across countries suggests that there is still a large room for countries where reforms are less advanced to adopt good practices. In these countries, more comprehensive implementation of labour market and product market reforms is needed to mobilise unused labour resources, put productivity growth on a faster trend and accelerate the growth of GDP per capita. Based on this overview, the paper raises some political economy issues related the method of coordination adopted by the Lisbon agenda.

40|$|This article proposes an analysis, {{which we}} {{consider}} extremely {{useful in the}} current economic context, {{of the evolution of}} labour income fiscality, more precisely, the effect of the public debt growth <b>on</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> for the labour income. The share of fiscal revenues from direct taxes, indirect taxes and social contributions is relatively close in the old member states of the European Union in comparison with the new member states, which register a lower level of income from direct taxes. The low level of income from direct taxes is compensated by more significant shares of the social contributions or indirect taxes. The main motivations of cross-border migration are: a successful career in a multinational corporation, high variations of the tax rate, of the salary income between states and, last but not least, the level of the net salary. To this day, there are no plans to harmonize across the European Union the legislation regarding the taxes wages and the social security contributions. Still, the European Union had in view the coordination of the national tax systems {{to make sure that the}} employees and the employers do not pay several times the social contributions in their movement across the community space. Despite the fact that some states tax the labour income at a low level, the labour fiscality remains high in the European Union in comparison with other industrialized economies, probably also due to the fact that the majority of the member states have social market economies. The increase of the fiscality level for the labour income determines the decrease of the employment rate and the raise of the unemployement rate. The solution to guarantee a higher employment rate, which is a target of the European Union Strategy "Europe 2020 " could be the relaxation of the labour income fiscality by transferring the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>on</b> the <b>labour</b> income towards property or energy taxation. labour income, social contributions, tax quotas, taxes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} labour demand, the elasticises of labour demand and {{adjustment}} through {{the theory of}} labour economics, an econometric model and its application to panel data set of finnish firms. First a continues and discrete time model of labour demand are specified with strictly convex or quadratic adjustment costs. In the econometric {{part of the study}} a model for labour demand with firm and time specific elasticises and adjustment are specified. The adjustment parameter is also explicitly modeled. From the econometric model for labour demand the wage-, output-, capital- and trend elasticity are calculated for each observation in time. Then these elasticities are averaged according to the factor of interest which in this thesis are 1. time, 2. industry and 3. size of firm. The same applies for the adjustment parameter. Especially the wage elasticity is of special interest as it describes the effects of the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> of <b>labour</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> demand. In the econometric part of the thesis the elasticises and adjustment of labour demand are estimated from an unbalanced panel data set of the 500 largest enterprises in Finland as measured by turnover. The data covers the years from 1986 to 2003 and has a total of 8185 observations. As an econometric research method a fixed effects nonlinear seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) algorithm is used to estimate labour demand. The results indicate that the wage and output elasticity of labour demand have increased during the observed period from 1986 to 2003. The wage elasticity has increased from - 0. 6 to - 0. 75 and the output elasticity from 0. 8 to 0. 9 in the long run during the data period. The same pattern is observed for these elasticises in the short run as well. Technical change has decreased labour demand by approximately two percent p. a. in the short and long run. These results confirm that finnish labour markets have become more flexible due to increased competition and integration of product markets which in turn are due to the single market policies of the EU and the effects of globalization <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> markets. The only surprise in the results is that the adjustment parameter has decreased slightly during the end of the observation period which points to mounting adjustment costs of labour demand and rigidities in the adjustment of labour markets. The results also show that the elasticises and adjustment of labour demand vary strongly with the industry of the firm. This points to the heterogeneity across firms and industries which validates the research strategy and methodology used here and should not be overlooked in empirical research in general. On the other hand firm size is not found to be a significant factor in determining the elasticises or adjustment. Therefore the explicit modeling of firm and time specific adjustment should be taken into account in future research <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> demand and its elasticises. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{time series}} {{evidence on the}} relationships, and possible trade-offs, between productivity and employment, and {{on the impact of}} taxes in this connection. First, a heoretical model is built for an open economy leading to the identification of technology, non-technology and labour and capital tax wedge shocks, as based on their long-run effects. Then structural VAR models are estimated for the EU- 15 and some other OECD countries to infer the above relationships. Our conclusion is that there is in the EU a fairly uniform and significant short-run negative impulse on employment from a positive productivity shock, while this becomes smaller and statistically insignificant over time in most, but not in some member countries. The former situation is interpreted to be an indication of nominal and the latter that of real or structural rigidity in the economy. In the US, there is no such trade-off, either in the short or long run. The impulse response of the shocks in the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> in the EU- 15 is a fairly sizeable and significant negative impact on employment both in the short and long run, while the effects of capital income tax shocks are negative on productivity, but not significant in statistical terms. 2 ̆ 022 How much does the Finnish forest cluster invest in biotechnology R&D activity, and what are the key application areas in the value chain...|$|E

30|$|There are two further issues. First, {{although}} we have perforce neglected other labor market institutions in this treatment, the first harks back to the interaction between extension agreements and other labor market policies (or indeed their absence). One obvious factor is the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge,</b> namely {{the difference between the}} cost of an employee to the firm and take-home pay. In analysis of 15 OECD countries, 1965 – 2007, Murtin et al. (2014) report that the adverse effect of the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>on</b> unemployment is large in countries with liberal extension procedures (such as France and Spain) and minimal in nations where extension is limited or absent (Scandinavian nations). Second, in nations where extension is vestigial, there is the issue of whether the coverage statistics are downwardly biased in circumstances where uncovered (i.e., non-union) firms “shadow” collective agreements in setting wages. Germany is often cited as a classic case in point. However, recent research does not suggest that such “orientation” practices constitute an important source of undercounting (see Addison et al. 2016 a).|$|R

40|$|Contrary to {{frequent}} {{recommendations of the}} public finance literature and international institutions, a persistently high <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>on</b> labor is observed in Europe. At the same time, the scope for shifting taxes from labor to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused in many European countries. This motivates our simulation of a revenue-neutral property tax reform for Germany, {{a country in which}} tax receipts from land are particularly low. More precisely, we assess by how much social insurance contributions (SIC) can be reduced when Germany switches from its current property tax scheme based on outdated cadastral values to one based on market property values. In order to make such a simulation possible, we match property related information with the input dataset of EUROMOD, the tax-benefit simulation model for the EU. Our results suggest that the implicit tax rate on labor could be reduced from currently 37, 2 % to 36, 5 %. Furthermore, we simulate different scenarios of the SIC reduction. Redistributive effects of these different scenarios tend to be modest and depend crucially on the design of the SIC reduction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the argument that}} accounting rules make the corporate income tax less salient and less distortionary by obscuring the timing of tax payments. I develop and estimate a model of investment where firms maximize a discounted weighted average of after-tax cash flows and accounting profits. The cost of capital, the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>on</b> the return on capital, {{and the impact of}} tax incentives for investment depend on the weight placed on accounting profits. I estimate this weight by comparing the effectiveness of tax incentives that do and do not affect accounting profits. Investment tax credits, which do affect accounting profits, have more impact on investment than accelerated depreciation, which does not. I argue that the difference in estimated impact is not driven by discounting, cash flow effects, or measurement error. The difference is larger among firms with higher measures of earnings management. Results thus suggest that the tax burden on corporate capital is lower than we would otherwise estimate, and accelerated depreciation provisions are less effective than they otherwise would be...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper defines three different synthetic measurements of disincentives for formal work: two standard measurements, namely the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> and the marginal effective tax rate (METR); and a new, innovative measurement called formalization tax rate (FTR). The novelty of the latter is that it measures disincentives stemming not only from labor taxation, but also from benefit withdrawal due to formalization. A descriptive analysis across a large number of OECD and Eastern European countries reveals that the disincentives for formal work – when measured through the FTR – are especially high for low-wage earners. This suggests that formal work might not pay in this segment of the labor market, in particular for the so-called mini-jobs and midi-jobs (low paying part-time work). Another novelty of the paper is its empirical approach. Using EU-SILC 2008 data and OECD Tax and Benefit data for six Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia), we match disincentives for formal work to individual observations in a large data set. Applying a probit regression, the analysis finds a significant positive correlation between FTR or METR and the incidence of being informal. In other words, controlling for individual and job characteristics, the higher the FTR or the METR that individuals are facing is, {{the more likely they are}} to work informally. The <b>tax</b> <b>wedge,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, yields a negative correlation. This indicates that the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> is not sufficiently capturing disincentives for formal work. We also conclude that in cross-country analysis, it might be more useful to use the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> that applies to low wage earners as opposed to average wage earners. formalization tax rate, measurement of work disincentives, informal employment, non-wage labor costs and benefits, tax evasion...|$|R
