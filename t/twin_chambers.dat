The data taken from preliminary tests will be presented to indicate the precision and accuracy of the instrument. The calorimeter and temperature-controlled bath, at present, require only a 30 -in. by 20 -in. tabletop area. The calorimeter is operated from a laptop computer system using unique measurement module capable of monitoring all necessary calorimeter signals. The calorimeter can be operated in the normal calorimeter equilibration mode, as a comparison instrument, using <b>twin</b> <b>chambers</b> and an external electrical calibration method.

40|$|Building materials, as {{a source}} of contaminant, such as {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs), and a sink of those pollutants, can significantly affect indoor air quality (IAQ). Physical models have been developed to predict volatile organic compound emissions from building materials. These results are helpful in adopting strategies to control the pollutant source. Therefore, experimental methods have been established for measuring input parameters to these models, such as diffusion coefficient (D), partition coefficients (K). However, currently available data of diffusion and partition coefficients are limited. Moreover, the effects caused by the physicochemical properties of VOC are not completely observed. Hence, it is requisite that a comprehensive investigation on the relationship between diffusion and partition coefficients, and the physicochemical properties of VOC be conducted.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{preparation}} of a composite pore-filled membrane based on self-assembled hydrogels is described. Responsive pore-filled membranes based on mixtures of dextran (molecular weight 6000) and the glucose binding lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) were prepared. The transport properties of these membranes were characterised using a <b>twin</b> <b>chamber</b> diffusion cell with Cibacron blue as a tracer solute. As the ConA molecules introduce affinity cross-links into the gel structure by binding to terminal glucose moieties on the dextran chains the mesh size increased as the physical cross-link density of the hydrogel decreased with increasing competing glucose concentration. This increased the gel-phase diffusion coefficient for the tracer with results obtained for the effect of glucose on transport rates showing a linear increase up to a concentration of 40 mM. Further increases in D-glucose concentration lead to a subsequent decrease in transport rate which is attributed {{to the effects of}} gel swelling increasing the diffusion path length. Control experiments conducted with L-glucose, which does not bind to ConA, showed no increase in transport rate confirming a specific competition effect...|$|R

Extensive test work carried out on slurry removal mechanism in grate discharge mills (ag/sag) {{has shown that the}} conventional pulp lifters (radial and curved) have inherent drawbacks. They allow short-circuiting of the slurry from pulp lifters into the grinding chamber leading to slurry pool formation.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from dry building material was developed based on mass transfer theory. The model considers both diffusion and convective mass transfer. In addition, it does not neglect the fact that, in most cases, the initial distribution of VOCs within the material is non-uniform. Under the condition that the initial amount of VOCs contained in the building material is the same, six different types of initial VOC distributions were studied {{in order to show}} their effects on the characteristics of emission. The results show that, for short-term predictions, the effects are significant and thus cannot be neglected. Based {{on the fact that the}} initial distribution of VOCs is very difficult to directly determine, a conjugate gradient method with an adjoint problem for estimating functions was developed, which can be used to inversely estimate the initial distribution of VOCs within the material without a priori information on the functional form of the unknown function. Simulated measurements with and without measurement errors were used to validate the algorithm. This powerful method successfully recovered all of the aforementioned six different types of initial VOC distributions.
