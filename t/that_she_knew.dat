Hindley told Topping <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of these killings.|$|E

Carey has reportedly been romantically linked with several male celebrities {{during the course of}} her career, some of which she has openly spoken about and acknowledged, while others she has denied dating. Eminem has claimed on multiple occasions that he dated Carey, but Carey has always firmly denied <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> him on a romantic level. In 2001, Carey contacted Eminem to discuss the possibility of writing a song together for inclusion on Carey's ninth studio album Charmbracelet (2002), and they reportedly started dating soon after.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering {{that her husband had}} begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E

5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir presumptive to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that {{to do so would}} invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> no one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.|$|E
5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She was fond of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged coccyx from being thrown off a horse. The actress has said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> she would be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina.

For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death. Julie also found out, so he panicked, and shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E
