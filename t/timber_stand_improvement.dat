40|$|The natural mineral {{constituents}} of stream water from forested basins constitute the threshold quality level above which {{the impacts of}} forest management must be measured or assessed from experiment. In any given region, according to Gibbs (1970), the average concentration of minerals in natural stream water will be under the dominance of processes associated with solution of the weathering soil mantle (rock dominance), the concentrations of ions in precipitation (precipitation dominance) or the balance between evaporation and crystallization within the basin (evaporation- crystallization dominance). Within this classification, the streams of the Southeast lie somewhere between precipitation and rock dominance. It is possible under extreme cases that man's activities on forest land, if severe and prolonged, can be classified as a fourth type of dominance in stream water chemistry.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.)

General stand descriptions were determined for four of the six conifer classes using mean values for stand characteristics from these timber stand examinations and spectral signatures of the classes. Discriminant analysis was applied to the average timber stand composition information paired with the six classes, from the Landsat data, identified as "conifer" by the California Department of Forestry (CDF). High standard deviations in each of the measured stand variables and poor assignments of plots to classes (41. 2 to 65. 2 percent) in the discriminant analysis limited the detail of the class descriptions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{expansion}} of selective logging in tropical forests {{may be an}} important source of global carbon emissions. However, the effects of logging practices on the carbon cycle have never been quantified over long periods of time. We followed the fate of more than 60 000 tropical trees over 23 years to assess changes in aboveground carbon stocks in 48 1. 56 -ha plots in French Guiana that represent a gradient of timber harvest intensities, with and without intensive <b>timber</b> <b>stand</b> <b>improvement</b> (TSI) treatments to stimulate timber tree growth. Conventional selective logging led to emissions equivalent to {{more than a third of}} aboveground carbon stocks in plots without TSI (85 Mg C/ha), while plots with TSI lost more than one-half of aboveground carbon stocks (142 Mg C/ha). Within 20 years of logging, plots without TSI sequestered aboveground carbon equivalent to more than 80 % of aboveground carbon lost to logging (- 70. 7 Mg C/ha), and our simulations predicted an equilibrium aboveground carbon balance within 45 years of logging. In contrast, plots with intensive TSI are predicted to require more than 100 years to sequester aboveground carbon lost to emissions. These results indicate that in some tropical forests aboveground carbon storage can be recovered within half a century after conventional logging at moderate harvest intensities...|$|E
