5|$|Although {{a quarter}} of their funding went on {{repairing}} damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted a report to <b>the</b> <b>NAS</b> in which they showed the feasibility of the project {{for the development of}} JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E

40|$|Responses to {{noradrenaline}} (NA) {{applied by}} superfusion, ionophoresis or pressure pulse were analysed using conventional intracellular recording and voltage-clamp methods in cat vesical parasympathetic ganglia. NA (1 microM) hyperpolarized 60 % of the neurones, depolarized 25 %, {{and produced a}} biphasic potential, which comprised a membrane hyperpolarization followed by a membrane depolarization, in 10 %. About 5 % of the neurones {{did not respond to}} <b>NA.</b> <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization was blocked by yohimbine (1 microM), an alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, whereas <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization was blocked by prazosin (0. 1 - 1 microM), an alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist. These data indicated that <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization was mediated through alpha 2 -adrenoceptors and <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization through alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization was accompanied by an increase in conductance, while <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization was associated with a decrease in conductance measured under manual-clamp conditions. Similar conductance changes were observed under voltage clamp. NA hyperpolarizations became smaller as the membrane was hyperpolarized and reversed polarity beyond - 100 mV. NA depolarizations also became smaller at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reversed polarity around - 90 mV. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> responses were enhanced in low-K media and depressed in high-K Krebs solution. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization was blocked by the Ca antagonists, Cd, Mn and Co. Intracellular injection of EGTA caused a slowly developing, progressive block of <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization was not affected by low Ca concentrations, Ca antagonists or intracellular injection of EGTA. In some neurones <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization was unmasked in solutions containing Ca antagonists and after intracellular EGTA injection. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization was depressed by intracellular injection and extracellular superfusion of Cs but not by TEA. Ba (10 - 100 microM) depressed <b>the</b> <b>NA</b> hyperpolarization by 30 %. <b>The</b> <b>NA</b> depolarization persisted in the presence of muscarine (10 microM) and was not blocked by Cs or TEA but was depressed 70 % by Ba (10 microM). These data are consistent with the hypotheses that alpha 2 -adrenoceptor activation produces a membrane hyperpolarization that is mediated through a Ca-dependent K conductance, and that alpha 1 -adrenoceptor activation produces a membrane depolarization through closure of a voltage-insensitive K channel...|$|R

Virgin Publishing published a series of original books, The New Adventures of Doctor Who (NAs), from 1991 to 1997. This series continued the stories of the seventh Doctor, further exploring and developing the themes and ideas introduced in the later years of the television series.

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of {{emission}} line galaxies {{selected from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the kinematics of the neutral gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) based on <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> Iλλ 5890, 5896 (Na D) doublet absorption line. By removing <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D contribution from stellar atmospheres, we isolate the line profile of <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess, which represents the neutral gas in the ISM. The kinematics traced by <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess show high velocity and velocity dispersion {{for a fraction of}} galaxies, indicating the presence of neutral gas outflows. We find that the kinematics measured from <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess are similar between AGNs and star-forming galaxies. Moreover, by comparing the kinematics traced by <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess and those by the [O III]λ 5007 line taken from Woo et al. (2017), which traces ionized outflows driven by AGNs, we find no correlation between them. These results demonstrate that the neutral gas in the ISM traced by <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess and the ionized gas traced by [O III] are kinematically independent, and AGN has no impact on the neutral gas outflows. In contrast to [O III], we find that the measured line-of-sight velocity shift and velocity dispersion of <b>the</b> <b>Na</b> D excess increase for more face-on galaxies due to the projection effect, supporting that Na D outflows are radially driven (i. e., perpendicular to the major axis of galaxies), presumably due to star formation.

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>NAS</b> report indicates, {{scientific}} knowledge regarding climate change was more uncertain {{than it is}} today. At the time that Rasool and Schneider wrote their 1971 paper, climatologists had not yet recognized the significance of greenhouse gases other than water vapor and carbon dioxide, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Early in that decade, carbon dioxide was the only widely studied human-influenced greenhouse gas. The attention drawn to atmospheric gases in the 1970s stimulated many discoveries in subsequent decades. As the temperature pattern changed, global cooling was of waning interest by 1979.|$|E
