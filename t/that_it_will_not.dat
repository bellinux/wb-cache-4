5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally.

25|$|The leave is {{sometimes}} considered a cricket shot, {{even though the}} batsman physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave {{is likely to be}} used by batsmen during the first few balls they receive, to give themselves time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batsman still has to watch the ball closely to ensure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept out of the path of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught. Batsmen only leave the ball when they are certain <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> hit the stumps.|$|E
