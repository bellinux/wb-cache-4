I find we're mostly writing to character: Is it George, or the old guy who runs the bank? What do they want, what are they <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> is the mood of that— is it staccato, are they agitated, is it a ballad?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Beat Takeshi told a {{documentary}} crew during filming {{that he believes}} [...] "an actor's job is to satisfy the director... I move the way I'm told to. I try to look the way I'm told to.

2500|$|In May 1999, the [...] removed two books, {{one being}} Bless Me, Ultima, from teacher Carol Bennett’s English classes. The removal was {{proposed}} by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett's {{students about the}} violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board's action: “What {{we are doing is}} trying to protect the children. And you got a teacher that’s <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we do not think is right”. All copies of Bless Me, Ultima were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal’s office.|$|E

2500|$|On February 21, 2006, {{the newly}} elected Dover Area School Board voted, {{unanimously}} with one abstention, to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages due to the parents and their lawyers {{as a result of}} the verdict in the case, a large sum of money for a small district. The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were going to accept less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board [...] "having the bill placed in their laps." [...] The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center. Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, [...] "Any board thinking of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> the Dover board did is going to have to look for a bill in excess of $2 million," [...] and [...] "I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought." ...|$|E

60|$|It was this. Discipline; drill; {{obedience}} to authority. That Roman army {{was the most}} admirably disciplined which the world till then had ever seen.

Do not interrupt. I warn you that I am not to be appealed to for getting you out of the difficulties you are plunging into; but of course your brother and sister will be mine as before; and as I promised myself to do the same by your mother as by your father--my near cousins both--here is to cover necessary expenses.' ...|$|E

But whether he loved you or not, his {{position}} now with Miss Assher is such that any love you may cherish for him can bring nothing but misery. God knows, I don't expect you to leave off loving him at a moment's notice. Time and absence, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is right, are the only cures. If it were not that Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel would be displeased and puzzled at your wishing to leave home just now, I would beg you to {{pay a visit to}} my sister. She and her husband are good creatures, and would make their house a home to you. But I could not urge the thing just now without giving a special reason; and what is most of all to be dreaded is the raising of any suspicion in Sir Christopher's mind of {{what has happened in the}} past, or of your present feelings. You think so too, don't you, Tina?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, dear aunt, {{you never}} heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families.

We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast, but He gives us different sorts of work, according as He fits us for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I can for the souls of others, than you could help running if you heard little Totty crying {{at the other end of}} the house; the voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger, and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{abstinence}} {{is not a}} {{good thing}} in itself. If it were, we should all be bound to abstain always from everything pleasant, and make ourselves as miserable and uncomfortable as possible, as some superstitious persons used to do in old times. Abstinence is only good when it is used for a good reason. If a man abstains from pleasure himself, to save up for his children; if he abstains from over eating and over drinking, to keep his mind clear and quiet; if he abstains from sleep and ease, in order to have time to see his business properly done; if he abstains from spending money on himself, in order to spend it for others; if he abstains from any habit, however harmless or pleasant, because he finds it lead him towards what is wrong, and put him into temptation; then he does right; then he is doing God's work; then he may expect God's blessing; then he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we all prayed God to help us to do, when we said, [...] "Give us grace to use such abstinence;" [...] then he is doing, more or less, what St. Paul says he did, [...] "Keeping his body under, and bringing it into subjection." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{failing to}} keep my promise to myself, not to write about myself. But there is some little excuse this time.
