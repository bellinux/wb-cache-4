50|$|Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are of two kinds: purine analogues and others. Purine analogues include allopurinol, oxypurinol, and <b>tisopurine.</b> Others include febuxostat, topiroxostat, and inositols (phytic {{acid and}} myo-inositol).|$|E
40|$|Alternatives to {{allopurinol}} SIR, In their {{letter to}} the Annals Kelsey et al state that there is 'no available alternative to allopurinol with its unique mode of action'. ' There {{are at least two}} alter-natives 2; <b>tisopurine</b> (IH-pyrazolo[3, 4 -d]pyrimidine- 4 -thiol (CSH 4 N 4 S)) and oxypurinol (lH-pyrazolo[3, 4 -d] pyrimidine- 4. 6 -diol(C,H 4 N 402)). Neither are available in the United Kingdom. In the treatment of gout, <b>tisopurine</b> has been shown to reduce effectively both the plasma and urinary uric acid levels of hyperexcretors, but plasma levels only of normal excretors. These effects were shown without a concom-itant increase in urinary hypoxanthine and xanthine excretion. - " <b>Tisopurine</b> is only one tenth as active as allopurinol (1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -dlpyrimidin- 4 -ol(C,H 4 N 40) ...|$|E
