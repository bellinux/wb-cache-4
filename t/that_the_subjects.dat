Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were {{randomly}} allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, {{based on the}} order in which they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E
25|$|Between 1979 and 1981, the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University {{reported}} {{a series of}} experiments they named Project Alpha, in which two teenaged male subjects had demonstrated PK phenomena (including metal-bending and causing images to appear on film) under less than stringent laboratory conditions. James Randi eventually revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were two of his associates, amateur conjurers Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards. The pair had created the effects by standard trickery, but the researchers, being unfamiliar with magic techniques, interpreted them as proof of PK.|$|E

25|$|Results {{from these}} {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} multiple consecutive sleep episodes of 4 or 6 hours significantly erode performance on the PVT and on measures of working memory, and that performance under these two conditions (i.e., 4 or 6 hours) was comparable to the performance that is found under conditions of 1 to 2 days of total sleep deprivation. Surprisingly, {{by the end of}} the 14 days of sleep restriction, subjects in the 4- and 6-hour sleep period conditions reported feeling only slightly sleepy. As these reports were taken when performance was at its lowest level, this indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> may no longer have been aware of their performance deficits because of inadequate recovery sleep (figure 3-2).|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients might benefit from learning how to speech read (lip reading).|$|E

500|$|The {{document}} {{from the}} April parliament, today {{referred to as}} the Declaration of 1308, contained three articles and was presented by the Earl of Lincoln. The first article invoked the so-called [...] "doctrine of capacities": <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of the realm owed allegiance to the institution of the Crown, not to the person of the King. If the King abused his position, it was his subject's duty to correct this, thereby upholding the pledge of the Boulogne agreement {{to protect the rights of}} the Crown. The second article was an attack on Gavestonthough he was not mentioned by nameimplicitly demanding his renewed exile. The third article referred to the additional clause from the coronation oath. It was here taken to mean that the king had obliged himself to abide by any decisions made by his subjects; past, present or future. The king initially held out against the opposition, but the earls also received support from Philippe IV, who was offended by Edward's apparent preference of Gaveston over Isabella. On 18 May Edward agreed to once again send Gaveston into exile.|$|E

After his parents' death when he was ten, he moved back to Japan to {{continue}} his father's work with his father's assistant Keiichirô. After he finished developing the technique for injecting genes into the future Mew Mews, he first tested it on himself to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> would not be harmed. As he was not a compatible host, it only gave him the ability to change into a cat at will for up to ten minutes at a time or else he will not be able to regain his human. Ryô also built Mew Ichigo's and Mew Berry's respective robot assistants, R2000 and R3000. Ryô tends to talk to the girls in an abrupt manner, but displays a strong sense of personal responsibility, particularly with regards to the Mew Mews. He helps Ichigo several times, in his cat form, [...] "Alto", including by kissing her to help her change back human. Although Ryô's age is never given in the series, the official Tōkyō Myū Myū– Tōjō Shin Myū Myū!– Minna Issho ni Gohōshi Suru Nyan game guide lists him as being fifteen years old. In Mew Mew Power promotional material he is listed as being sixteen.|$|E

2500|$|These {{included}} a rigid {{adherence to the}} protocol of the test, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> {{would not be allowed}} to change it in the midst of the run. This had been the modus operandi of Uri Geller while being tested at Stanford Research Institute; whenever something did not work, he simply did something else instead. The researchers then reported this as a success, when in fact the original test had failed. Other suggestions included having only one object of study at any time, permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched, and having as few people in the room as possible to avoid distractions. Randi also offered his services to watch the experiments as a control, noting that a conjurer would be an excellent person to look for fakery. Phillips did not take Randi up on the offer because of the skeptic's reputation of being [...] "a showman rather than an unprejudiced critic" [...] and his perceived hostility towards psychic claimants. In his letters, Randi even told the researchers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were fake, but the researchers did not check out their backgrounds.|$|E

[...] In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association, National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, and Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, the Court had sustained drug testing under the special needs doctrine in light of the subjects' consent; in Chandler v. Miller, the Court had struck down drug testing under the special needs doctrine despite the subjects' consent.

This experiment suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had modified the neural representation of their phantom limbs and generated the motor commands needed to execute impossible movements {{in the absence of}} feedback from the body. The authors stated that: [...] "In fact, this finding extends our understanding of the brain's plasticity because it is evidence that profound changes in the mental representation of the body can be induced purely by internal brain mechanisms—the brain truly does change itself." ...|$|E

In a September 2009 interview, Strassman described the effects on participants in the study. He stated that [...] "subjectively, the most interesting results were that high doses of DMT seemed to allow the consciousness of our volunteers to enter into non-corporeal, free-standing, independent realms of existence inhabited by beings of light who oftentimes were expecting the volunteers, and with whom the volunteers interacted. While 'typical' near-death and mystical states occurred, they were relatively rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{photographic}} {{and video}} evidence {{was shown in}} court on 29 October 2008, {{as part of a}} larger presentation of over 300 photographs and two videos. The defense objected to the presentation, claiming that the evidence was obtained illegally, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> shown in the video and the photographs were digitally altered to resemble the suspects. When Suprunyuk and Sayenko were asked if they recognized the people in the photographs, they replied that they did not. Judge Ivan Senchenko responded by stating: [...] "You are not blind." [...] Valery Voronyuk, an expert on film and video editing, testified that the video was not faked or altered. The court rejected all defense objections, accepted the prosecution's argument that the material was genuine and showed the suspects in the act of murdering their victims.|$|E

Sidney's argument that [...] "free men always {{have the right to}} resist tyrannical government" [...] was widely quoted by the Patriots at the time of American Revolutionary War, and Thomas Jefferson considered Sidney to {{have been one of the}} two primary sources for the Founding Fathers' view of liberty. Sidney believed that absolute monarchy was a great political evil, and his major work, Discourses Concerning Government, was written during the Exclusion Crisis, as a response to Robert Filmer's Patriarcha, a defence of divine right monarchy. Sidney firmly rejected the Filmer's reactionary principles and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of the monarch were entitled by right to share in the government through advice and counsel.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} experiment, the social sharing tended to decline as time passed, but the intense emotion {{condition}} elicited significantly more sharing {{during the first}} two minutes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were together. The findings again suggest that intensity of the emotion and the extent of sharing are not linked monotonically. In both studies, about 90% of the verbal exchanges were comments by targets. Targets’ expressions predominantly consisted of [...] "giving information" [...] and [...] "expressing feelings" [...] about the movie, thereby conforming to the formal definition of the social sharing of emotion. On the other hand, the partners’ comments were found to be brief and to consist mainly of requests for further information and expressions of feelings elicited by the targets’ sharing. In this regard, the findings are quite consistent with previous research showing that the sharing of an emotion elicits emotional responses for the listeners. According to Luminet et al. these results suggest that social sharing fulfills informational goals as well as emotional ones.|$|E
