On ground level there is a multi-purpose area, food technology kitchen and tutor room - as well as classrooms. Sampford House was named after a Principal, Evelyn. E. Sampford.

The hyponym/hypernym hierarchical structure provides a way of locating the superordinate concepts of sp. By following additional hypernyms, we will get more and more generalized concepts and eventually reach the most general concept, such as fperson, human being, [...] . g. Based on this scenario, for each concept, different degrees of generalization can be achieved by adjusting the distance between this concept and the most general concept in the WordNet hierarchy.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>s</b> which, beside {{their basic}} (or denominative) function, {{have the power}} to express various grades of emotional emphathis of the user of the language. In the Italian terminology these word s are called "alterate" and are formed mainly by augmentative and deminutive suffixes and prefixes. The Italian language, indeed, has a rich source of "alterate words" that allow the speaker not only to identify objects or facts of extra-linguistic reality; but also to express speaker's emotional involvement, mood, temper or feelings. This phenomenom is not characteristic in every modern language. Among the European languages, only Slavonic languages {{seem to be able to}} compete with Italian in the examined field. One of the basic problems of augmentative/diminutive expressions is to distinguish their denominative and evaluative characters. Border 1 ines between the stylistically neutral (denominative) and the stylistically coloured (connotative) augmentatives/diminutives are rather blurred. Especially for the non-native user of the Italian language, it can be veryenigmatic to understand the nuances conveyed by such words as casa (house), casone (big house), casaccia (bad house), casetta (little house), casuccia (nasty house). For this reason the representative lexical material obtained from [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) {{procedures for}} the random sampling of some one-dimensional lattice paths with constraints, for various constraints. We will see that an approach inspired by optimal transport allows us to efficiently bound the mixing time of the associated Markov chain. The algorithm is robust and easy to implement, and samples an ”almost ” uniform path of length n in n 3 +ε steps. This bound makes use of a certain contraction property of the Markov chain, and {{is also used to}} derive a bound for the running time of Propp-Wilson’s Coupling From The Past algorithm. 1 Lattice Paths with Constraints We are interested in this paper in some families of one-dimensional lattices paths. We fix three integers n, a, b> 0, and consider the paths of length n, with steps +a / − b, that is, the words of n letters taken in the alphabet {a,−b}. Such a word s = (s 1, s 2, [...] ., sn) is identified to the path S = (S 1, [...] ., Sn) : = (s 1, s 1 +s 2, [...] ., s 1 +s 2 + · · ·+sn).

40|$|Let Γ be {{directed}} strongly connected finite graph of uniform outdegree (constant outdegree of any vertex) and let some coloring of edges of Γ turn the graph into deterministic complete automaton. Let <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>s</b> be {{a word in}} the alphabet of colors (considered also as letters) {{on the edges of}} Γ and let Γs be a mapping of vertices Γ. A coloring is called k-synchronizing if for any word t |Γt | ≥ k and for some word s (called k-synchronizing word) |Γs | = k. The k-synchronizing coloring turns the graph into a deterministic finite automaton possessing a k-synchronizing word. The road coloring problem is a problem of k-synchronizing coloring of Γ for k = 1. The problem was posed by Adler, Goodwyn and Weiss over 30 years ago and evoked noticeable interest. The recent positive solution of the road coloring problem instantly posed the problem of k-synchronizing coloring for arbitrary integer k. The necessary and sufficient conditions of k-synchronizing coloring are presented. They have the same simple form {{as in the case of}} synchronizing road coloring: the directed strongly connected graph of uniform outdegree has k-synchronizing coloring if and only if the great common divisor of length of its cycles is k. The corollary for arbitrary directed finite graph of uniform outdegree is also presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about mental and {{linguistic}} representation. It addresses {{the question of}} how people understand words, how they are used to convey meaning and how this meaning is acquired. I take a theoretical approach to the issue, and try to develop a constructive account on the basis of insights from Relevance Theory and Jerry Fodor s construal of informational semantics. I investigate the theoretical viability of two hypothesis underlying work in relevance theoretic pragmatics: 1) the input to pragmatic processing is in most cases an impoverished semantics in the form of encoded concepts (=radical pragmatics) 2) these concepts are mental items which have their content in virtue of standing in a constitutive relation to something in the world (=semantic externalism) Against these hypotheses the thesis raises two main challenges: one of which is explaining how the notion of the words-concepts relation being one of encoding squares with data from cross-linguistic lexical variation. The second challenge is how concepts representing abstract (non-perceivable) entities are acquired. As a positive contribution, the thesis makes two main claims. The first is that the relationship between words and concepts should be thought of as one of potential activation. By this I mean that words can on a given occasion be used to express any of a number of candidate concepts, but none of these are seen as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>s</b> encoded or default meaning. A consequence of this view is that lexical items are not plausibly seen as having any meaning inherently. Rather, words get their meaning in context, by way of a semantically constrained pragmatic process that picks out the most relevant of a range of corresponding concepts from occasion to occasion. The second main claim is that the meaning of many words are epistemically incomplete, in that the concepts they potentially activate have their meaning as a result of speakers relying on each other to entities that are not or cannot be perceived. The idea here is that language speakers to a great extent defer to other people for the content of a concept...|$|E

There are also found images of the Saviour, or of saints, symbolical figures of men or of animals, the keys (which appear for the first time on the coins of Benevento) etc. From the sixteenth century to the eighteenth, Biblical or moral phrases are added, in allusion to the saint or to the symbol that is stamped upon the coin, e.g. MONSTRA TE ESSE MATREM, SPES NOSTRA, SUB TUUM PRÆSIDIUM, TOTA PULCERA, SUPRA FIRMAM PETRAM, DA RECTA SAPERE (during the Conclave), UBI THESAURUS IBI COR, CRESCENTEM SEQUITUR CURA PECUNIAM, HILAREM DATOREM DILIGIT DEUS, PRO PRETIO ANIMÆ, FERRO NOCENTIUS AURUM, IN SUDORE VULTUS, CONSERVATÆ PEREUNT, TOLLE ET PROIICE, etc. Sometimes allusion is made to an historical event, as the acquisition of Ferrara, or the deliverance of Vienna from the Turks(1683), or to some concession of the pope to his subjects, or to a jubilee year. From the time of Clement X the coins struck at Rome bear a minute representation of the coat of arms of the prelate in charge of the mint, a custom that obtained until 1817.
