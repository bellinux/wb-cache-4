5|$|In 2005, DiCaprio {{was made}} a {{commander}} of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts. The following year, the actor starred in both Blood Diamond and <b>The</b> <b>Departed.</b> In Edward Zwick's war film Blood Diamond, he starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who {{is involved in the}} Sierra Leone Civil War. The film itself received generally favorable reviews, and DiCaprio was praised for the authenticity of his South African Afrikaner accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate. In Scorsese's <b>The</b> <b>Departed</b> he played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an Irish Mob in Boston. Highly anticipated, the film was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006. Budgeted at US$90 million, it also emerged as DiCaprio and Scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date, easily beating The Aviator´s previous record of US$213.7 million. DiCaprio's performance in <b>The</b> <b>Departed</b> was applauded by critics and earned him a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor. The same year, both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild nominated DiCaprio twice in the Best Actor category for both of his 2006 features, and in addition, DiCaprio earned his third Academy Award nomination for Blood Diamond.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Damon began his acting career by {{appearing}} in high school theater productions. He made his professional acting debut in the film Mystic Pizza (1988). He came to prominence in 1997 when he wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting alongside Ben Affleck, which won them the Academy and Golden Globe awards for Best Screenplay and earned Damon a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

40|$|What {{happened}} {{to women who}} are former athletic directors of intercollegiate athletic programs during {{each of the four}} stages of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience was <b>the</b> problem of this study. A qualitative design using personal interviews for data collection and ethnoscientific explanation for analysis of the data were used to study thirty-one women who were athletic directors between 1975 and 1986. Analytical tasks performed {{for each of the four}} levels of analysis helped answer research questions directed toward finding patterns among women in the following areas: what {{happened to}} them within and throughout the four stages of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience, reasons they left the position of athletic director, and satisfaction in their subsequent job. Analysis of the data established that <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience occurred in four stages. How the subjects responded to the way that opportunities for female student-athletes were offered during each st 3 ge of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience determined whether they were in positive or negative circumstances. Sixteen subjects either were in positive circumstances throughout <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience or ended it in positive circumstances. Fifteen subjects were either in negative circumstances throughout <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience or ended it in negative circumstances. The ability to reevaluate their beliefs and values, adapt to changes in their programs, make rational decisions, and influence others to support their decisions determined whether they were in positive or negative circumstances in each stage of <b>the</b> <b>departing</b> experience. In general, the findings of this study support literature on women in administrative positions and literature on the effects of job loss and job change...|$|R

5|$|St. Anger is {{the eighth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on June 5, 2003, by Elektra Records. It was the band's last album released through Elektra, and the second-longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica, with nearly six {{years between the}} release of Reload and this album. It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica. St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded, filling in for <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> bassist Jason Newsted.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 season saw Nolan {{take over}} from <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> Jay-Jay Okocha as club captain. His three league goals helped Bolton to again {{qualify for the}} UEFA Cup. Nolan's long throw-in set up a goal, which helped Bolton achieve a 2–2 draw away against German champions Bayern Munich, who {{dominated}} the match. Despite reaching the first knockout round, Bolton's league form suffered as they were pulled into a relegation fight, eventually finishing the season one point above the relegation zone in 16th. Nolan scored in the 2–0 win over Sunderland in May that virtually secured the club's Premier League status.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio was {{nominated}} for his first Academy Award, BAFTA Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor {{for his role as}} Howard Hughes in the biographical drama The Aviator (2004); he also won a Golden Globe Award in the same category. For his next appearances—the crime drama <b>The</b> <b>Departed</b> (2006), the war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008) and the biographical drama J. Edgar (2011)—he garnered Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Drama nominations. DiCaprio earned nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Actor for his roles in the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010) and the science fiction thriller Inception (2010). He co-produced and played stockbroker Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), a role that earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

He won the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Hugh Glass in the 2015 film The Revenant.|$|E
5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in {{and contribute to the}} power play and replace <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He was taken off the power play unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|During the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets parted ways with defensemen Jan Hejda, Anton Stralman, Sami Lepisto and Mike Commodore. Hejda, who played {{four of his}} first five NHL seasons with the Blue Jackets, was offered a contract by Columbus, but felt that the organization undervalued him and left via free agency. Columbus had offered him a three-year, $7.5 million contract. He instead signed a four-year, $13 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche. Stralman and Lepisto were not given qualifying offers which made them unrestricted free agents, and both signed with other teams. Commodore had originally signed a big contract with the Blue Jackets in 2008, but fell out of favor. He was waived, sent to the minors and eventually had his contract bought out. In order to replace <b>the</b> <b>departed</b> players, Columbus not only acquired James Wisniewski, but also signed ten-year NHL veteran Radek Martinek. Martinek played only seven games with the Blue Jackets before suffering a concussion and missing {{the remainder of the}} season. Brett Lebda was brought in to replace him.|$|E
