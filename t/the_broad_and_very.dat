40|$|Abridged] Broad MgII 2800 and Hbeta {{lines have}} emerged as the most {{reliable}} virial estimators of black hole mass in quasars. Which is more reliable? Comparison of MgII 2800 and Hbeta profile measures in the same sources and especially FWHM measures that provide the virial broadening estimator. Identification of 680 bright Sloan Digital Sky Survey DataRelease 7 quasars with spectra showing both MgII 2800 and Hbeta lines, at redshift 0. 4 < z < 0. 75. The s/n of these spectra are high enough to allow binning in the "four-dimensional (4 D) eigenvector 1 '' optical plane and construction of high s/n composite spectra. We confirm that MgII 2800 shows a profile that is ~ 20 % narrower as suggested in some previous studies. FWHM measures for Population B sources (i. e., with FWHM of Hbeta larger than 4000 km/s) are uncertain because they show complex profiles {{with at least two}} broad-line components involving a nearly unshifted broad and redshifted very-broad component. Only the broad component {{is likely to be a}} valid virial estimator. If Hbeta and MgII 2800 are not corrected for the very broad component then black hole mass values for Population B sources will be systematically overestimated by up to logM ~ 0. 3 - 0. 4 dex. We suggest a simple correction that can be applied to the majority of sources. MgII 2800 is the safer virial estimator for Population B sources because the centroid shifts with respect to rest frame are lower than for Hbeta. In <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> broad component profile interpretation this is a consequence of the lower very broad to broad component intensity ratio for MgII 2800. Effective discrimination of black hole mass and Eddington ratio at fixed redshift is not achieved via luminosity binning but rather by binning in a " 4 D eigenvector 1 '' context that reflects different broad line region geometry/kinematics likely driven by Eddington ratio.

40|$|We present new deep Very Large Telescope (VLT) /FORS optical spectra with {{intermediate}} {{resolution and}} large wavelength {{coverage of the}} compact radio source and ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) PKS 1345 + 12 (4 C 12. 50; z = 0. 122), taken {{with the aim of}} investigating the impact of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear interstellar medium (ISM). PKS 1345 + 12 is a powerful quasar [L(H beta) (NLR) similar to 1042 erg s- 1] and is also the best studied case of an emission line outflow in a ULIRG. Using the density-sensitive transauroral emission lines [S ii] 4068, 4076 and [O ii] 7318, 7319, 7330, 7331, we pilot a new technique to accurately model the electron density for cases in which {{it is not possible to}} use the traditional diagnostic [S ii] 6716 / 6731, namely sources with highly broadened complex emission line profiles and/or high (N-e greater than or similar to 104 cm- 3) electron densities. We measure electron densities of N-e = (2. 94 + 0. 71 (- 1. 03)) x 103 cm- 3, N-e = (1. 47 + 0. 60 (- 0. 47)) x 104 cm- 3 and N-e = (3. 16 + 1. 66 (- 1. 01)) x 105 cm- 3 for the regions emitting the narrow, broad and very broad components, respectively. We therefore calculate a total mass outflow rate of M-circle dot yr- 1, similar to the range estimated for another compact radio source, PKS 1549 - 79. We estimate the total mass in the warm gas outflow is M-total = (8 + 3 (- 3)) x 105 M-circle dot with filling factors of epsilon = (4. 4 + 1. 8 (- 1. 5)) x 10 - 4 and epsilon = (1. 6 + 0. 7 (- 0. 5)) x 10 - 7 for the regions emitting <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> broad components, respectively. The total kinetic power in the warm outflow is erg s- 1. Taking the black hole properties published by Dasyra et al., we find that only a small fraction [] of the available accretion power is driving the warm outflow in PKS 1345 + 12, which is significantly less than that currently required by the majority of quasar feedback models (similar to 5 - 10 per cent of L-bol), but similar to the recent suggestion of Hopkins & Elvis if a two-stage feedback model is implemented (similar to 0. 5 per cent of L-bol). The models also predict that active galactic nuclei (AGN) -driven outflows will eventually remove the gas from the bulge of the host galaxy. Our observations show that the visible warm outflow in PKS 1345 + 12 is not currently capable of doing so. However, it is entirely possible that much of the outflow is either obscured by a dense and dusty natal cocoon and/or in cooler or hotter phases of the ISM. This result is important not just for studies of young Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum/Compact Steep Spectrum radio sources, but for AGN in general...|$|E
40|$|Istraživanje povijesti hrvatskog i jugoslavenskog poslijeratnog dizajna misija je u koju se posljednjih godina upušta sve više kustosa, kritičara, povjesničara umjetnosti (i dizajna), ali i samih dizajnera i dizajnerica. Pretpostavka je da je razdoblje od 1945. do 1991. godine istraživačima naročito zanimljivo stoga što kronološki najpreciznije obuhvaća period socijalističke modernizacije, omeđen s dva rata koji su proces modernizacije neposredno potaknuli, odnosno definitivno prekinuli. Dok se u međuratnom razdoblju rastuće područje dizajna percipiralo u sklopu primijenjenih umjetnosti, u kontekstu političkog i ekonomskog ustrojstva druge Jugoslavije, te ubrzane industrijalizacije regije, uloga i značenje dizajna približili su se shvaćanju struke u Zapadnim zemljama, gdje je dizajn podrazumijevao – u progresivnim sredinama tako je i danas – kompleksnu humanističku, inženjersko-projektantsku i kreativnu disciplinu, koja svoj puni smisao može ostvariti jedino dosljedno integrirana u sve aspekte gospodarske i industrijske proizvodnje. Research {{into the}} history of Croatian and Yugoslav post-war design is a mission on which in the recent years ever more curators, critics, art and design historians as well as actual {{designers}} have ventured. The assumption is that the period from 1945 to 1991 is particularly interesting to researchers because it chronologically precisely covers the period of socialist modernisation, bounded by two wars, one that immediately set off the modernisation process and on that just as definitely brought it to an end. The exhibition was created by Dr Jasna Galjer, full professor in the art history department of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of Zagreb University, {{one of the most important}} Croatian experts in the history of design, As with other archaeological projects of the type, it dealt with a very important industrial designer whose name is today forgotten, save among experts and a few fellow workers. The exhibition is divided into chronologically successive segments that are however not sharply divided from each other, and the audience can see the most important examples from all phases of Planinšek’s career in their totality and note all the links and parallels. Also found here are student pieces from the short-lived Academy of Applied Arts in Zagreb (1950 - 1955) where Planinšek acquired the degree of architect specialised in interior design, including three-dimensional exercises with different materials, confirming the striking essential similarities between current educational models and those of more than half a century ago, both of them being founded on the modernist assumptions of two German institutions: Gropius’ Bauhaus (1919 - 1933) and the Ulm Design School / Hochschule für Gestaltung (1953 - 1968). A further part of the exhibition is organised in terms of the clients and firms with whom Planinšek mostly worked and achieved excellent results in the region as well as on the international scene, from the Saponia factory in Osijek and the many smaller firms for which he designed exhibition pavilions and shop interiors to electronic equipment factories that employed him from the mid-sixties onwards – Elektron of Samobor and RIZ and TRS of Zagreb. In this period Planinšek created the designs for a whole series of devices from gramophones to pocket calculators, and even aids for the diabetic, pioneering products on the Yugoslav market. His industrial design was featured in advertising campaigns in the media contributing to the creation of corporate brands, by outstanding creative people in all areas, and many examples of such adverts can be seen at the exhibition, above all <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> systematic advertising for the BIS detergent of Saponija, the packaging of which was designed by Planinšek. Still, his major international success must be the design of the electric coffee grinder, MIKI, for Elektron, which was presented at the St Louis exhibition in 1965, shoulder to shoulder with works of designers such as Max Bill, Tapio Wirkkala and Ettore Sottsass, leading figures of post modernism...|$|E

Gestational age alone had few independent effects (increase in CD 3 +, CD 8 +CD 45 RA+, and CD 11 α+ cells, and decrease in CD 14 +, HLA-DR− cells) during the third trimester on the proportions of the immune cell subtypes studied. Neonatal infection and mother's pre-eclampsia had <b>the</b> <b>broadest</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> opposite kinds of effects on the profile of immune cells in the blood. Infection of the neonate increased the proportions of several ‘immature’ cells (CD 11 α−CD 20 +, CD 40 +CD 19 −, and CD 14 +HLA-DR−), whereas mother's pre-eclampsia decreased the proportions of naive cell types (CD 4 +CD 8 +, CD 5 +CD 19 +). In addition, neonatal infection increased the proportion of T cells (CD 3 +, CD 3 +CD 25 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio, and CD 45 RA+ cells), while maternal pre-eclampsia had a decreasing effect on the proportion of CD 4 + cells, CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio, and proportions of CD 11 α+, CD 14 + and CD 14 +HLA-DR+ cells. Maternal betamethason therapy increased the proportion of T cells (CD 3 +) and macrophages (CD 14 +, CD 14 +HLA-DR+), but decreased the proportion of natural killer (NK) cells. Caesarean section was associated with a decrease in the proportion of CD 14 + cells. We conclude that the ‘normal range’ of proportions of different mononuclear cells is wide during the last trimester; further, the effect of gestational age on these proportions is more limited than the effects of other neonatal and even maternal factors...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Purpose. Lomerizine {{dihydrochloride}} (LOM) is a Ca 2 + channel blocker {{used as an}} antimigraine drug, {{which is}} currently administered orally in Japan. We therefore investigated the effect of terpenes in propylene glycol (PG) solvent on the percutaneous absorption of LOM by hairless mouse skin. Methods. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were carried out to analyze the effects of terpene enhancers on the biophysical properties of the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin. Results. Of the terpenes tested, the highest permeation rate of LOM (28. 8 g/cm 2 /h) was observed with 1, 8 -cineole, while nerolidol conferred the lowest enhancement of LOM flux (14. 2 g/cm 2 /h). ATR-FTIR studies revealed that terpenes/PG induced higher CH 2 stretching frequencies of SC lipids than PG alone. The extent of penetration of the lipophilic fluorescence probes Nile Red and DiI was measured by CLSM in in vitro skin permeation studies, using either PG or terpenes/PG as skin permeation enhancers. With PG alone, both fluorescence dyes were undetectable in the skin. In contrast, when co-administered with terpenes/PG, both probes were distributed into the intercellular space between corneocytes and detected in the deeper layers of the skin. SAXS measurements showed that in SC treated {{with a combination of}} 1, 8 -cineole and PG, the scattering peak of <b>the</b> SC was <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> weak in intensity compared to untreated SC, whereas pretreatment with PG alone di...|$|R

The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases.
