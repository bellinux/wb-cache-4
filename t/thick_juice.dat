The tree (abieiro) bears fruit on July and December. Açaí (served in the bowl): the fruit is always present in meals of families from Pará; and it represents part of the local economy. It can be served with tapioca or manioc flour. Açaí is often the main meal at lunch - eaten with fish, shrimp or dry meat of ox (called charque) fried. There {{are two kinds of}} açaí: the best known, the purple one; and another with a color pulp light cream, the “white açaí”. The tree, açaizeiro, also produces the açaí palm heart (palmito), taken {{on the basis of its}} “crown”. Palm heart is frequently used in refined regional dishes. Acerola: fruit rich in vitamin C, widely used in juices and frozen desserts. Ajuru: is a small shrub with hypoglycemic, widely used in popular medicine. Its fruits have a white and sweet pulp. Ameixa (jamelão): is a purple berry, an olive type, you can eat the fruit and make a juice. Care must be taken because it stains and the mouth stays with a purple color. Araçá: is a small, rounded fruit with seeds and the color of the pulp varies depending on the species. It’s part of the jabuticaba and guava family. Bacaba: originating from a palm tree of the same family of açaí. It produces a <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> used in the same manner that açaí for drinks, sweets and ice cream.

This [...] "Explanations" [...] text includes the (c. 280) Lingbao wufu jing 靈寶五符經 [...] "Scripture of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans", which says:The Third Immortal King told the Emperor: In the old days I followed a dietetic regimen and attained immortality. My teacher made me increase the sweet spring in my mouth and swallow it {{in accordance with the}} following incantation: [...] "The white stones, hard and rocky, are rolling on and on. The gushing spring, bubbling and pervasive, becomes a <b>thick</b> <b>juice.</b> Drink it and attain long life - Longevity forever longer!" [...] These twenty-two words—you should follow them! If you can actually do this and nourish on the True One without stopping, swallow from your flowery pond without interruption, then your inner energy will grow and remain strong, never to be weakened. You attain the Tao by avoiding all grains. You will never again have to follow the rhythm of the moon and plant or harvest. Now, the people of mysterious antiquity, they reached old age because they remained in leisure and never ate any grains. As the Dayou zhang 大有章 (Verse of Great Existence) says: [...] "The five grains are chisels cutting life away, making the five organs stink and shorten our spans. Once entered into our stomach, there's no more chance to live quite long. To strive for complete avoidance of all death, keep your intestines free of excrement!" [...] (tr. Kohn 1993:149-150)Campany uses internalism and externalism to analyze how early texts justified the idea that shiqi 食氣 [...] "eating qi" [...] is better than shigu [...] "eating grains". For examples (2005:2), [...] "We eat X because X makes us live long" [...] is an internalist rationale based upon essential properties or benefits; [...] "We eat X and not Y, which is what those other people eat" [...] is an externalist claim based upon cultural stereotypes. After comprehensive analysis of how early texts describe [...] "grain" [...] (i.e., [...] "mainstream food") avoidance, from the (c. 320 BCE) Zhuangzi to the (c. 320 CE) Baopuzi, Campany (2005:43) concludes the (c. 280 CE) Lingbao wufu jing is the earliest passage [...] "in which grains are attacked as a food source based on what we might call negative internalist reasons—that is, {{on the grounds that they}} cause actual harm to the body in specific, theorized ways." [...] Before the 3rd century, Chinese classical texts did not claim that [...] "grains" [...] actually harm the body, they argued that [...] " [...] qi and other more refined substances, when ingested and circulated in esoterically prescribed ways, give superior and (for some texts at least) longevity-inducing nourishment."One of the striking things about the texts we have reviewed is that most of them offer very little by way of an internalist critique of grains or other everyday foods. That is, they all recommend avoiding grains and offer what they tout as superior alternatives, but on the question of precisely why grains are such inferior nourishment they have little or nothing to say. What little internalist critique we do find comes quite late — apparently Eastern Han at the earliest — and does not seem well developed: ordinary foods, described as rotten and smelly, impurify a body that must be brought into qi-based resonance with heaven. This impurity is located specifically in the intestines. … In most discussions, then, it is not that prescribers and practitioners of transcendence arts portrayed ordinary food as harmful; it is rather that they had what they considered superior alternatives to offer. But, why these diets of qi or of rare herbs and minerals should be regarded as superior to one of ordinary food is a question that very often remains unanswered; we are merely, but repeatedly and in diverse ways, told that they are superior. (2005:48)Echoing Claude Lévi-Strauss, Campany (2005:50) suggests that grains, inexorably linked with all their cultural and institutional symbolisms, were [...] "good to oppose" [...] rather than being seen as intrinsically [...] "bad to eat." [...] One of the major reasons for consuming wild plants and exotic foods was the inherent contrast with eating everyday [...] "grains".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the normal relation of swallowing apnea (SA) onset relative to lingual bolus propulsion along with factors that may alter this relation. Forty adults, composed of ten males and ten females in each of two age groups (i. e., 20 - 30 and 63 - 79 years) participated. SA onset was assessed during 5 - and 20 -ml bolus volumes of water and apple juice across three trials. The effects of age, gender, bolus volume, bolus viscosity, and gustation on SA onset relative to lingual bolus propulsion were examined. A significant interaction of age by gender by volume was found. In general, older adults initiated SA onset earlier than young adults and large boluses elicited an earlier SA onset than small boluses regardless of group. Young males demonstrated significantly later SA onset than the older males for large volumes, this difference was not observed for small volumes nor was it found between young and older females.

40|$|Background and Aims: Storing sugar {{extracts}} as <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> {{a form of}} sucrose syrup, {{is common}} practice in the sugar industry. Even under good storage practices, microbiological problems can sometimes occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires greater understanding of microbial dynamics of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the microflora associated with <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation in order to define better process controls. Materials and Methods: Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> samples. Based on results obtained by these approaches, specific PCR primers were designed for routine detection of the most predominant species. Results and Discussion: Both CLA and T-RFLP revealed that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the presence of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species. Other microorganisms were also detected in both types of samples, but none were present as consistently or nearly as abundantly as T. halophilus. These results report the first association of T. halophilus with a sugar-rich environment. Based on its high density, we believe that this organism potentially plays a role in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. Therefore, PCR primers were designed and verified to specifically detect this species in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> matrices to further elucidate its presence and putative role in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{research}} on fermentation processes showed that {{sugar beet pulp}} let obtain higher ethanol yield &ndash; 87 % of theoretical than sugar beet <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> &ndash; 84 % of theoretical, both for Ethanol Red and Fermiol yeast preparations. Moreover, it was exhibited that the increase of sugar concentration in the fermentation medium obtained from <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> statistically importantly influenced ethanol yield decrease, for both yeast preparations. The distillates&rsquo; quality analysis showed the influence of raw materials and microorganism used for fermentation on pollution degree. Distillate obtained from <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> was characterised with the lowest by-products content after fermentation with Ethanol Red. |$|E
60|$|Years later, {{when she}} had left us and when I had grown almost to manhood and {{we were living in}} another place, I found that we had as {{neighbour}} a Belgian gentleman who was a botanist. I could not find a specimen of my plant to show him, but gave him a minute description of it as an annual, with very large, tough, permanent roots, also that it exuded a <b>thick</b> milky <b>juice</b> when the stem was broken, and produced its yellow seeds in a long, cylindrical, sharply-pointed pod full of bright silvery down, and I gave him sketches of flower and leaf. He succeeded in finding it in his books: the species had been known upwards of thirty years, and the discoverer, who happened to be an Englishman, had sent seed and roots to the Botanical Societies abroad he corresponded with; the species had been named after him, and it was to be found now growing in some of the Botanical Gardens of Europe.|$|R
60|$|Then very leisurely, {{as one who}} is {{sure that}} he will not be interrupted, Hokosa began to climb the tree, till at length some of the green fingers were within his reach. Resting his back against a bough, one by one he broke off several of them, and averting his face so that the fumes of it might not reach him, he caused the <b>thick</b> milk-white <b>juice</b> that they {{contained}} to trickle into the mouth of a little gourd which was hung about his neck by a string. When he had collected enough of the poison and carefully corked the gourd with a plug of wood, he descended the tree again. At the great fork where the main branches sprang from the trunk, he stood a while contemplating a creeping plant which ran up them. It was a plant of naked stem, like the tree it grew upon; and, also like the tree, its leaves consisted of bunches of green spikes having a milky juice.|$|R
40|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in characterizing various components of fruit ripening process, the molecular mechanisms regulating fruit texture and other attributes remain poorly understood. Using fruit juice viscosity as an indicator of cell wall solubilization and depolymerization, I tested the possibility of isolating novel genes that affect fruit quality attributes. Characterization of genes differentially expressed in thick- and thin juice tomato genotypes resulted in isolation and characterization of a small heat shock gene, designated as vis 1 (viscosity 12 ̆ 6 barbelow;). My results show that vis 1 transcript accumulation is negatively correlated with tomato juice thickness in different genotypes. Two alleles of vis 1 exhibit genomic DNA polymorphism. Vis 1 -hta (vis 1 -high t 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ranscript a 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ccumulator) and vis 1 -lta (vis 1 - 1 ow t 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ranscript a 2 ̆ 6 barbelow;ccumulator) are associated with high and low vis 1 transcript accumulation, and low and high juice viscosity respectively, in diverse genotypes and in segregating progenies of lines heterogeneous for vis 1 alleles. Vis 1 expression is enhanced by elevated temperature and fruit ripening, and it exhibits typical chaperone activity when expressed in E. coli. Transgenic tomato plants over- and under-expressing vis 1 were created to determine its role in plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. Contrary to what was expected from above studies, transgenic fruit over-expressing vis 1 yielded significantly <b>thicker</b> <b>juice</b> than wild type fruit, while impaired expression of vis 1 reduced juice viscosity. In addition, fruit with impaired expression of vis 1 ripened earlier, had less average fruit weight. These results have provided the first genetic evidence for a stress protein regulating fruit ripening and fruit quality. To determine if expression of other classes of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is also regulated during fruit ripening, I have examined the diurnal expression of diverse heat shock genes, including members of different classes of sHsps, three Hsp 70 s, an Hsp 90, and an Hsp 100 in tomato fruit under the field conditions at a wide range of temperatures. I show herein that expression of most classes of Hsps is increased by the daytime increase in temperature under field conditions. However, transcripts accumulated more rapidly in ripening fruit than in green fruit. These results suggest that heat perception increases with fruit ripening. I propose that Hsps, including Vis 1 protein, play significant roles in fruit ripening process by protecting fruit from environmental and ripening associated stresses. ...|$|R

Even under good storage practices, microbiological problems may occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires {{greater understanding of the}} microbial dynamics of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage.

Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> samples. Based on the results obtained by these approaches, a nylon membrane-based DNA array targeting 16 S rDNA sequences was developed for all bacterial species detected. For signal amplification, the target DNA was amplified using universal primers that anneal to conserved sequences flanking diagnostic domains, simultaneously labeled, and subsequently hybridized to the array. Detection was performed using the anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and CDP-Star substrate. Both CLA and T-RFLP demonstrated that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the dominance of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species, but revealed also other osmophilic bacteria possibly pernicious during sugar production including Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Kocuria spp., Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Tetragenococcus species. In order to monitor the bacterial population dynamics during <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage, a specific <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> macro-array was developed covering these bacteria. Using the array, a diverse microbial population was found at the beginning of storage, which evolved to dominance of Tetragenococcus species mostly accompanied by Staphylococci.

50|$|Lastly, {{sugarcane}} {{is another}} important symbol found in the book. One of Amabelle’s recurring dreams {{is one of the}} sugar woman. The chains bind the sugar woman and she wears a silver muzzle. This muzzle was given to the sugar woman so that she would not eat the sugarcane. However, despite her confinements, she is dancing. Much like the workers, they come to the Dominican Republic to find work and a better life and stay due to the work that they find in the mills that they cannot find in Haiti. Regardless of their hard work, the workers cannot taste the sweetness of the sugarcane; instead, they are bound by it. In fact, they cannot escape it. Danticat even describes Sebastien with his sweat as <b>thick</b> as sugarcane <b>juice</b> and many of his defining scars a result of working in the cane fields.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} ingredient is the fish, harvested {{from the many}} rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. The extremely wet climate {{of the region and}} the large numbers of water bodies has ensured that large varieties of fresh water fish are available in abundance in the valley. It is a staple item in the Assamese palate. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for pisciculture. Some of the most popular big fishes are the Borali (Freshwater Shark), rou, and cital (big), khoria (medium) (Chitala chitala), maagur, Xingi, borali, bhokua or bahu, Xaal, Xol, etc. The small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam like puthi, Ari (Long-whiskered catfish), Goroi (Green snake head/ Spotted snake head [...] ), Koi or Kawoi (Climbing perch Anabas testudineus), Kholihona (Indian paradise fish Ctenops nobilis) borolia, mua, ceniputhi, tengera, lachin, bhangun, pabho, etc. [...] The discerning gourmet would be able to tell which region of Assam is known for which variety of fish. The mas tenga (sour fish [...] ), which is commonly eaten by most communities of Assam, has lately turned into a signature dish of Assamese cuisine. The most popular souring agent for the tenga is tomatoes, though ones made with kajinemu <b>juice</b> (<b>thick</b> skinned elongated lemon) and thekera (dried Mangosteen,) are also popular. However, the most common way of eating fish in traditional Assamese homes is by preparing a stew with a variety of herbs, vegetables and greens as per preference and availability. Fish is also prepared by roasting or char grilling. A favorite is small fish roasted in banana leaves (paatotdia). Hukoti is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish like (puthi maas) pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of Northeast India in general and Assam in particular. Dried and fermented small fish puthy mas (Ticto barb), three to four in numbers are roasted along with lavish amounts of green chillies, tomatoes, ginger and garlic (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice. Fish eggs and fish innards are also cooked in various ways and consumed.|$|R
40|$|Kluyveromyces marxianus KD- 15, called flex yeast, is {{a strain}} that is {{insensitive}} to catabolite repression {{and has the}} capacity to produce ethanol efficiently from a mixture of beet molasses and whey powder. When a fermentation test was conducted in 50 mL of a medium containing 200 mg mL- 1 of sugar as sugar beet <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> diluted with an arbitrary amount of crude whey, strain KD- 15 produced over 99 mg mL- 1 ethanol in all the media tested, and ethanol formation decreased in proportion to the volume of whey by K. marxianus NBRC 1963, the parental strain of KD- 15, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae NBRC 0224, the reference strain for conventional ethanol production. Fermentation of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> diluted with whey alone by strain KD- 15 at 30 °C initially proceeded slower than that at 33 °C to 37 °C but finally bore the highest level of ethanol. The maximum ethanol concentration obtained in 1. 5 L of a medium using a 2 -L fermentor was elevated by aeration of 15 to 50 mL min- 1 and reduced by that in excess of 100 mL min- 1.
