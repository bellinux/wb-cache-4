5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

25|$|At a {{news conference}} TEPCO Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata announces that {{it is unclear how}} the {{problems}} at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> be resolved. An immediate difficulty is the removal of large quantities of radioactive water in the basement buildings, but also salt build up inside the reactors, from using seawater for cooling, will need to be removed.

The largest hydroelectric facility {{in the country is}} the 900 MW Mantaro Complex in southern Peru, which is operated by state-owned Electroperu. The two hydroelectric plants at the complex generate over one-third of Peru’s total electricity supply.

25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton picker, {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> continue to grow.|$|E

The bank will provide up to US$22.9 million, which will supplement the US$36.7 million originally approved for the 17-MW project. The project is located in Jinotega Province about 160 kilometers north of Managua. Spain's Cobra engineering and construction firm began construction of the project in 2009, however, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> be operated by state power firm Enel.

25|$|In late September 2008, Sanyo Electric Company, Ltd. {{announced}} {{its decision to}} build a manufacturing plant for solar ingots and wafers (the building blocks for silicon solar cells) in Inagi, Tokyo. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> begin operating in October 2009 and will reach its full production capacity of 70 megawatts (MW) of solar wafers per year by April 2010.

The new joint company will start production and sales at an initial scale of 80MW and gradually increase its production capacity.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> need {{to import}} 4.72million tons of coal per year. This massive freight will need about 59 ships each having 80,000-ton {{capacity}} {{that would be}} taken to the port {{on the bank of the}} Poshur river. The 40 kilometres from the port to the plant cuts through the Sundarbans and it includes the river flow path. Environmentalists say these coal-carrying vehicles are not often covered as they scatter large amounts of fly ash, coal dust and sulphur, and other toxic chemicals are released throughout the life of the project. Carrying large amount of coal through the shallow rivers also pose a threat as five vessels with load of coal, oil and potash sank in the nearby rivers from the time period of December 2014 to January 2017.|$|E

25|$|Secondary hemiepiphytes start life on {{the ground}} or on part of a tree trunk very close to the ground, where the seeds sprout. These philodendrons have their roots in the ground early in their lives. They then begin {{climbing}} up a tree and eventually may become completely epithytic, doing away with their subterranean roots. Secondary hemiepiphytes do not always start their lives close to a tree. For these philodendrons, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> grow with long internodes along the ground until a tree is found. They find a suitable tree by growing towards darker areas, such as the dark shadow of a tree. This trait is called scototropism. After a tree has been found, the scototropic behavior stops and the philodendron switches to a phototropic growth habit and the internodes shorten and thicken. Usually, however, philodendrons germinate on trees.|$|E
25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, buying from a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E

25|$|The {{plant hormone}} {{ethylene}} is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene {{is known for}} regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even {{when there is no}} stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>will</b> not be able to cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress. Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.|$|E
