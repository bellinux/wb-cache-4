5|$|Edward {{refurbished}} {{the royal}} palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, {{such as the}} State Opening of Parliament, {{that his mother had}} forgone, and founded new honours, such as the Order of Merit, to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences. In 1902, <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> of Persia, Mozzafar-al-Din, visited England expecting to receive the Order of the Garter. Edward refused to bestow the honour on <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> because the order was meant to be in his personal gift and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, had promised it without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian order of chivalry. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia, but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers. Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> with a full Order of the Garter the following year.|$|E
5|$|A National Anthem Committee {{was formed}} in 1948, but it had {{difficulty}} finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on August 10, 1950 and was approved for playing during the visit of <b>the</b> <b>Shah.</b> However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on August 13, 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on August 16, 1954 followed by a performance of the national anthem in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.|$|E
5|$|Shah Jahan's first {{contribution}} to the fort commenced {{in the year of}} his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645. Shah Jahan first ordered construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall. Though construction of <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction. Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era. The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> Jahan period.|$|E

5|$|After the Báb was {{executed}} in 1850, {{a group of}} Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted an assassination plan against <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> Nasser-al-Din Shah, {{in retaliation for the}} Báb's execution. Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan; however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished in June 1851 when he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's request, returning only after Amir Kabir's fall from power. On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> and failed. The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the Bábí community that were encouraged and orchestrated by the government. During this time many Bábís were killed, and many more, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál ("black pit"), an underground dungeon of Tehran.|$|E

Mírzá Yahyá had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on <b>the</b> <b>Shah,</b> and after Bahá'u'lláh's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there.

5|$|Australian {{forces were}} at times {{involved}} in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006, {{as well as}} actions in Chora in 2007, Kakarak in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010, and Doan in 2011; although others {{have yet to be}} publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a drawdown in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and are stationed in Kandahar and Kabul. Over 26,000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate, {{and then}} part of Sudbrook Park, were {{incorporated}} into Richmond Park. Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge. The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851. Between 1855 and 1861, new drainage improvements were constructed, including drinking points for deer. In 1867 and 1876 fallow deer from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first fallow deer introduced to that country In or around 1870, the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Italian general and politician, visited Lord John Russell at Pembroke Lodge in 1864, as did <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> of Persia, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in 1873. He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.|$|E

Upon approaching the coast of Bangladesh, officials canceled all flights to and from <b>the</b> <b>Shah</b> Amanat International Airport. Additionally, authorities {{at the port of}} Chittagong worked to protect cargo ships from the storm, and it was ultimately closed for a period of 19hours. In preparation for Akash, officials advised coastal residents to evacuate further inland; about 80,000 total residents left for emergency shelters.

5|$|Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{followers}} of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh.

Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison.

Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven {{out of the country}} by the war.|$|E
