50|$|A Field-tube boiler (also {{known as}} a bayonet tube)is a form of {{water-tube}} boiler where the water tubes are single-ended.

One of the most important systems which can be used to exploit energy stored in the solar rays is a <b>Thermo-syphon.</b> A <b>thermo-syphon</b> works under the principle of natural convection, in which the working fluid rises, once it heats up, due to reduction in its density. The research regarding the effect of various types of thermal loadings on the performance output of a <b>thermo-syphon</b> is severely restricted, and most of the work available is based on experiments in which the detailed analysis of the complex flow field within the <b>thermo-syphon</b> is extremely difficult to perform. Hence, the present study focuses on the use of advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques to simulate natural convection in a <b>thermo-syphon</b> operating under various loading conditions.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} reliance on fossil fuels, renewable energy {{has become an}} important topic of research in recent years. The development in the renewable energy source will help in meeting the requirements of limiting greenhouse-gas effects, and conserve the environment from pollution, global warming, ozone layer depletion, etc. There are various naturally available renewable energy sources. One of these sources is solar energy. Solar energy is available in abundance throughout the world and is the cleanest of all known energy sources. There are various devices {{that can be used}} to harness solar energy. One of such devices is a <b>thermo-syphon.</b> <b>Thermo-syphon</b> converts the solar energy obtained from the Sun into thermal energy of a working fluid. This thermal energy in the working fluid can be used for various industrial and household activities. In a closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> system, the working fluid circulates within the <b>thermo-syphon</b> loop via natural convection phenomenon and does not need any external devices, such as a pump. Therefore, it is considered to be one of the most efficient devices for the heat transfer. Moreover, the absence of a pumping device reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs of a <b>thermo-syphon</b> system. The heat exchange process in the <b>thermo-syphon</b> is a complicated process, which considers the heat convection phenomenon. Therefore, to understand the natural convection process in the <b>thermo-syphon</b> and their effect on the thermal performance of the system a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been used. Numerical results obtained have been verified against the experimental results, and they match closely with each other. The comparison between the CFD and experimental result, suggest that CFD can be used as an effective tool to analyse the performance of a <b>thermo-syphon</b> with reasonable accuracy. In order to investigate the flow structure within the <b>thermo-syphon</b> system, detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses have been carried out in the present study. The qualitative analysis of the flow field includes descriptions of the velocity magnitude and the static temperature distributions contours within the closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> system. Furthermore, the variation in the temperature of water within the storage tank, temperature of the working fluid, heat transfer coefficient, wall shear stress, and local velocity and temperature distribution of the working fluid within <b>thermo-syphon</b> loop have been quantified as a function of time. In addition, numerical studies have been conducted to identify the effects of various geometrical parameters, which include the number of the riser pipes, length-to-diameter ratio of the riser pipe on the thermal performance of a closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> system. Moreover, a further investigation has been carried out to analyse the effect of various heat flux conditions and different transient thermal loadings on the thermal performance of a closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> system. Based on these analyses some novel semi-empirical relations have been developed to predict the thermal performance of the <b>thermo-syphon,</b> which is one of the focal points of this research. Another goal of the current study is to improve the thermal performance characteristic of <b>thermo-syphon</b> solar water heating system using an enhancement device to improve the heat transfer. This aspect of the work focuses on the increasing energy conversion from the riser pipes to the working fluid within the <b>thermo-syphon</b> loop. This is accomplished by increasing the surface area of riser pipes by employing several design modifications, such as straight, wavy and helical pipes, within the riser pipes, while maintaining the amount of the working fluid constant within the closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> system. In this study, a comparative analysis has been carried out for these new design modifications to identify the best in terms of heat transfer coefficient, heat gain in collector etc., as an indication of thermal performance. According to the findings of this analysis, the model comprising of pipe inside the riser pipe depict better thermal performance as compared to other models. After defining the best design modification, a further detailed investigation has been carried out between the traditional and modified design (straight pipe inside the riser pipe) using experimental and numerical method. Established methods regarding the design process of thermo-syphons are very limited, and they are severely limited in estimating important design parameters, such as useful heat gain and heat transfer coefficient, which have a significant impact on the thermal performance of <b>thermo-syphon</b> system/loop. A design methodology has been developed to enrich the design process of a closed loop <b>thermo-syphon</b> solar water heating system. The developed methodology is more efficient and reliable since it is capable of estimating various geometrical and thermal parameters, such as collector area, diameter and length of the riser pipes, distance between the centers of the riser pipes, heat transfer coefficient, temperature of the working fluid and the mass flow rate. This design methodology is user friendly and robust...|$|E

First, a comparison between IAS and water is done both physically and chemically of being used as a working fluid in phase change heat transfer devices. Above all, the chemical constituents in an IAS fluid are investigated, and a method is given to produce it. Afterwards, the physical properties of IAS are measured and compared to those of water. Moreover, a chemical analysis is performed, and the chemical reactions involved between IAS and the surfaces of copper or aluminum made devices where it is to be used are listed and categorized by their contributions to the heat transfer performance or the surface passivation. In addition, OLI software, commercial software to simulate electrolytes, is used to estimate the amount of the solid products, generated by redox reactions or temperature increases, at different temperatures and ratios of being concentrated. At the end, a coating study is performed to understand how each chemical coats the surface and how it contributes to the surface wettability. The positive and negative effects of each coating are discussed and demonstrated by data from SEM observations and contact angle tests. Second, using IAS in copper made phase change heat transfer devices is discussed, and the main focus is how IAS improves the heat transfer performance by a smaller thermal resistance and a larger critical heat flux. At the beginning, a 1 -D diffusion model is built and used to estimate the concentration profiles of chemicals along the liquid flow path and the location where each coating begins to be deposited. Next, a capillary rise test is performed to show how each chemical contributes to the improvement of the surface wettability. The heat transfer performance of water and IAS are compared for a <b>thermo-syphon</b> test at different inclination angles, a grooved flat heat pipe test, and a sintered heat pipe test. The test results validate the conclusions of the diffusion model and the capillary rise test. Based on the results of the comparison tests, the advantages and limits of using IAS, for performance enhancement purposes in various heat transfer applications, are discussed. Last, an investigation of the aluminum passivation, with IAS being used as the working fluid in aluminum made phase change heat transfer devices, is done, and the key factors, that lead to failures, are discussed. Initially, an electrochemical theory of aluminum passivation is introduced, and the existence of an electrochemical cycle is demonstrated by an aluminum <b>thermo-syphon</b> test. Afterwards, the importance of a continuous liquid back flow to aluminum passivation is pointed out, and a vertical <b>thermo-syphon</b> test with natural convection cooling is used to demonstrate that a discontinuous liquid back flow is the main reason of the failures.

40|$|Introduction Access to radiometals {{suitable}} for labeling novel molecular imaging agents requires {{that they be}} routinely available and inexpensive to obtain. Proximity to a cyclotron center outfitted with solid target hardware, or to an isotope generator for a radiometal of interest is necessary, both {{of which can be}} significant hurdles in availability of less common isotopes. Herein, we describe the production of 44 Sc, 68 Ga, 89 Zr, 86 Y and 94 mTc in a solution target which allows for the production of various radiometallic isotopes, enabling rapid isotope-biomolecule pairing optimization for tracer development. Work on solution targets has also been performed by other groups [e. g. 1, 2]. Material and Methods Solutions containing a high concentration of natural-abundance zinc nitrate, yttrium nitrate, calcium nitrate [3], strontium nitrate or ammonium heptamolybdate [4] were irradiated on a 13 MeV cyclotron using a standard liquid target. Some of the solutions contained additional hydrogen peroxide or nitric acid to improve solubility and reduce pressure rise in the target during irradiation. Yields calculated using theoretical cross sections (EMPIRE [5]) were compared to the measured yields. In addition, we tested a <b>thermo-syphon</b> target design for the production of 44 Sc. Chemical separation of the product from the target material was carried out on a remote apparatus modeled after that of Siikanen [6]. Results and Conclusion The proposed approach enabled the production of quantities sufficient for chemical or biological studies for all metals discussed. In the case of 68 Ga, activity up to 480 ± 22 MBq was obtained from a one hour run with a beam current of 7 µA, potentially enabling larger scale clinical production. Considering all reactions, the ratio of theoretical saturation yields to experimental yields ranges from 0. 8 for 94 mTc to 4. 4 for 44 Sc. The <b>thermo-syphon</b> target exhibited an increase of current on the target by a factor of 2. 5 and an increase in yield by a factor of five for the production of 44 Sc. Separation methods were developed for all isotopes and separation efficiency ranges from 71 ± 1 % for 94 mTc to 99 ± 4 % for 86 Y. 44 Sc, 68 Ga, and 86 Y were successfully used in labeling studies with a model 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetrazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelate, while 89 Zr coordination behavior was tested using desferrioxamine-alkyne (DFO-alkyne). In summary, we present a promising new method to produce a suite of radiometals in a liquid target. Future work will continue to expand the list of radiometals and to apply this approach to the development of various peptide, protein and antibody radiotracers...|$|E

Solar {{energy is}} still not being used {{effectively}} in countries in the developing world, though it's a partial {{solution to the problem}} of shortage and expensive energy. Normally harvested through flat plate collectors, converting solar radiation into heat is the most direct application that can be effected in water heating systems. Many researchers have attempted to develop means of improving the efficiency of the flat plate solar energy collector; however there appears to be no evidence of any work regarding the effect of geometric configuration on the performance of flat plate solar collector. This study presents results obtained when comparing the performance of a solar water heating system equipped with three manufactured flat plate solar collector panels of numerically identical surface area but of different geometric configuration as they were individually attached to a typical geyser. Data was obtained inside a laboratory. The amount of heat acquired from flat plate collectors of solar energy depends primarily on their surface area that is exposed to the solar irradiance, however, the geometry of the collectors was thought that it might affect to some extent the amount of heat harvested. The circulation of the water from the panel to the geyser was due to the self-induced <b>thermo-syphon</b> effect. The results obtained during the test period (7 hours per day for two consecutive days) indicated that the system’s thermal efficiency was best when the square geometrical configuration collector was used. A dimensional analysis using the Π Buckingham method that was performed on the parameters affecting a flat plate solar collector yielded three dimensionless numbers that lead to a power law relationship which might be useful in enhancing solar water heating systems’ design...|$|E
