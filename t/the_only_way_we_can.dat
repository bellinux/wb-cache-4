500|$|As {{a result}} of this investigation, GM {{announced}} that it would offer any new GM car in exchange to any Volt owner who has concerns while the federal investigation was taking place. In December 2011, the company said that if necessary they were prepared to recall all the vehicles and repair them upon determination of the cause of the fires, and also announced they would buy back the car if the owner was too afraid of the potential for a fire. GM's CEO also said that {{it may be necessary to}} redesign or make changes to the battery pack depending on the recommendations from federal officials. As of December 1, 33 Volt owners in the U.S. and 3 in Canada had requested a loaner car. As of December 5, General Motors reported that a couple dozen Volt owners had requested the carmaker to buy back their cars, and the company had already agreed to repurchase about a dozen. Before the carmaker agrees to buy back each vehicle, other options are explored as GM primarily wants to provide loaner cars, but [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make them happy is to repurchase it, then we will," [...] a GM spokesman said. General Motors explained that the buy back price includes the Volt purchase price, plus taxes and fees, less a usage fee based on how many miles the car has been run. As of January 5, 2012, GM reported that around 250 Volt owners had requested either a loaner vehicle or a potential buyback.|$|E

2500|$|For Leibniz, [...] "God is an {{absolutely}} perfect being." [...] He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of {{something with the}} most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection [...] "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" [...] (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: [...] "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are [...] "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" [...] {{because we have the}} ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> truly love God is by being content [...] "with all that comes to us according to his will" [...] (IV).|$|E
2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the albums {{name is a}} pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the [...] "666 sect"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention {{to the topic of}} vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message. [...] "It's the only song I think {{they will be able to}} play on the radio" [...] said Ogre, continuing [...] "I hope they do play it because it's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message". [...] "Testure" [...] also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988, scoring thirteenth place in the magazine's year end list.|$|E
