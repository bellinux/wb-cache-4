40|$|There are {{at least}} two views on what relativism is. One is a view that relativism is a <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally wrong or equally false as well as equally right or equally true.

This paper {{critically}} examines the two views and concludes the latter is a more proper concept of relativism according to critical rationalism, and the <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally wrong or equally false is not relativism but relativizationism, which is compatible with criticism in Popper’s sense...|$|R
