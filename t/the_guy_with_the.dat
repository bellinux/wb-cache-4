500|$|The job {{of leading}} the foreign {{language}} productions of Hair was given to Bertrand Castelli, Butler's partner and {{executive producer of the}} Broadway show. [...] Castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau. [...] Butler described him as a [...] "crazy showman ... <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> business suit and beads". [...] Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. [...] The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used. [...] Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities. [...] Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968 with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg, , [...] and , produced and directed by [...] and choreographed by Julie Arenal, and ran for 134 performances until March 1969.|$|E

Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too.

500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for New York Post, Larry Getlen wrote, [...] "Veteran {{journalist}} Bill Carter {{details the}} vicious recent battle over 'The Tonight Show,' showing how Leno {{was hardly the}} devious schemer he was made out to be, and how O’Brien was not always the angelic innocent the media portrayed, {{as he and his}} team aggressively pursued the show at every opportunity." [...] Jon Bershad of Mediaite commented, [...] "It’s as tense and exciting as expected." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author [...] "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist". Joe Flint of Los Angeles Times commented about changes in the media industry since Carter's prior book The Late Shift, [...] "The only difference is that the media world has changed a lot then, and while [...] "The Late Shift" [...] had a lot of inside dirt and drama that was news to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote, [...] "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best contract, wins", and called the book, [...] "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher". Writing for ABC News, journalist Sheila Marikar commented, [...] "Bill Carter's new book, 'The War for Late Night,' reveals what happened behind the scenes, the expletives that were hurled during closed-door discussions, the roller coaster that O'Brien, Leno, and their cohorts rode during that tumultuous time." ...|$|E

500|$|Nutting {{ordered an}} initial {{production}} run of 1,500 units of Computer Space, an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade {{game at the}} time would sell around 2,000 units, though a handful had reached 10,000. Reception to the game from distributors was mixed; while some were excited by the game, others felt it to be confusing {{and part of a}} passing video game fad. By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1,000 units, and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1,300 and 1,500 units. While this was a commercial success, making over US$1,000,000, it was a disappointment to Nutting, who had been hoping for a large-scale success like Computer Quiz. The game's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve, which pushed away customers used to less complex games. Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in, like the Dutch Goose playtest location, were generally located near university campuses; the general market for coin-operated games, however, was in working-class bars, where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game. In the documentary Video Game Invasion: The History of a Global Obsession, Bushnell explained, [...] "Sure, I loved it, and all my friends loved it, but all my friends were engineers. It was a little too complicated for <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> beer in the bar." [...] Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game; he has said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then. Conversely, Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game's novelty was also part of its appeal to players—most people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it, rather than playing video from a remote television station.|$|E

2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master {{to be sent to}} New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a need-to-know situation and I figured nobody needed to know. I had been in the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
