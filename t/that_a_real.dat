Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

In that year, Josip Jurčič and Josip Stritar published a new edition of Prešeren's collection of poems. In the preface, Stritar published an essay which is still {{considered one of the}} most influential essays in Slovene history. In it, he showed the aesthetic value of Prešeren's work by placing him in the wider European context. From then on, his reputation as the greatest poet in Slovene language was never endangered.|$|E

25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|Lord Hope of Craighead {{delivered}} the majority judgment. Reaffirming that the High Court remained the final {{court of appeal}} in criminal matters in Scotland and that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to review the merits of its decisions made in exercise of that function, he ruled that the Appeal Court had applied the wrong test in law in relation to article 6(1), namely, whether they believed {{that there had been a}} miscarriage of justice rather than whether there was 'a real possibility that the jury at this trial would have arrived at a different verdict' which created a miscarriage of justice, based on the precedent of McInnes v Her Majesty's Advocate. He concluded <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility existed, and accordingly allowed the appeal, and remitted the matter to the Appeal Court with a direction to quash Fraser's conviction, once it had decided whether he should be re-tried, in exercise of the court's powers under paragraph 13 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.|$|E

500|$|... "Murder" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniels. Daniels particularly enjoyed directing both the cold open, {{as well as the}} closing tag, likening both to [...] "an action film". In regards to the latter, he referred to it as a sequence that director Quentin Tarantino would have thought up, and noted the importance of having the camera appear {{in the middle of the}} Mexican standoff to reveal Fischer. Wilson, Helms, and Carell enjoyed filming the scene, and were particularly exuberant when it came time to fake-kill each other. Several of the scenes, such as when Andy first asks Erin on a date, had to be re-shot so that the cameras were in more discreet places. Daniels later referred to these shots as [...] "spy shots". Initially, after Michael announces that [...] "there has been a murder", the show was supposed to have cut to a commercial break.

500|$|Fortitude South {{has been}} {{credited}} with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord. Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans [...] "readily accepted the existence and location" [...] of FUSAG, believed {{the threat to the}} Pas de Calais was real and [...] "it was only at the end of July" [...] that they realized a second assault was not coming; [...] "by that time, {{it was too late to}} move reinforcements". However, Mary Barbier wrote [...] "it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated". She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat-ready, that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division, which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion, and that the Germans had realized as early as May <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat to Normandy existed. Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to [...] "preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais", the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army's inaction because they held a [...] "preconceived notion of what FORTITUDE would accomplish". Following the Battle of Normandy, the phantom 80th Division was [...] "transferred" [...] around the east coast of England, moving back and forth between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps. The division was eventually [...] "disbanded" [...] in April 1945.|$|E
