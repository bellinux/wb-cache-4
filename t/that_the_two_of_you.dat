50|$|Exactly how far {{the affair}} between Lucetta and Henchard went is unclear. The book {{strongly}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them have had sexual relations, but is ambiguous enough to not offend the sensibilities of 19th century readers. Whatever happened was enough for Lucetta's reputation to be so irreparably tarnished <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only solution for her is to leave Jersey and change her name. She takes the last name of her deceased relative, Templeman, and alters her first name {{to make it sound}} more English.|$|R
