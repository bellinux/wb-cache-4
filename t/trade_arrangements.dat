However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E

40|$|The {{large and}} vibrant {{informal}} trade between India and Nepal continues to thrive despite unilateral/bilateral/regional/multilateral trade liberalisation {{in the two}} countries. This calls for an indepth analysis of India's informal trade with Nepal. Using insights from the New Institutional Economics informal and formal institutions engaged in cross-border trade are contrasted. The objective in juxtaposing formal and informal institutions in performing similar transactions viz., engaging in crossborder international trade is threefold: first, to understand how informal trading markets function vis-à-vis formal <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> second, to analyse formal and informal <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> particularly {{in the context of}} the relative importance of institutional factors vis-à-vis trade and domestic policy distortions, and third, to see whether informal <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> provide better institutional solutions than formal <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The analysis, carried out on the basis of an extensive survey conducted in India and Nepal reveals that informal traders in India and Nepal have developed efficient mechanisms for contract enforcement, information flows, risk sharing and risk mitigation. Further, informal traders prefer to trade through the informal channel because the transaction costs of trading in the informal channel are significantly lowe...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the Europe Agreements and the CEFTA and considers {{their impact on}} trade flows and trade policy of transition economies. The relationship of regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> to the multilateral trading system {{is an important issue}} in trade policy. Today, the intensification of regional integration initiatives is clear and regionalism emerges {{as an integral part of}} the trading environment. Regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> are developed as "building blocks" and not as "stumbling blocks" to multilateral liberalisation. The prospects of enhanced economic growth resulting from better regional specialisation and increased FDI flows attracted by expanding regional markets are important economic factors. In transition economies, regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> are expected to complement and solidify shifts toward market-oriented reforms. Multilateralism and regionalism are in contradiction only if liberalisation is exclusively associated with the global trade perspective while regional trade is linked with protectionist tendencies. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{outlines}} a {{new approach}} for analyzing the role of trade in promoting industrial development. It offers an explanation as to why firms are reluctant to move to countries with lower labor costs and shows how trade liberalization can change the incentives for firms to locate in developing countries.

By changing the attractiveness of countries as a base for manufacturing production, they can potentially trigger [...] or postpone [...] industrial development. The analysis shows that unilaterally liberalizing imports of manufactures can promote industrialization but that membership in a preferential <b>trading</b> <b>arrangement</b> is likely to create larger gains.

AFTA and CER are the only two regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the East Asia/West Pacific region and both are advancing to a high degree of regional integration. This article argues that there are undoubted gains to be had from an AFTA-CER link by itself which includes reciprocal trade liberalisation as well as trade facilitation. Both groups of countries would benefit from freer trade between them and both have a lot to learn from the experiences of the other regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, this link will be redundant if the Bogor Declaration of the APEC is implemented after the Osaka meeting of APEC Leaders in November 1995. If, instead, multilateral trade liberalisation through the World Trade Organisation and APEC falters, an AFTA-CER link becomes an important possibility.

40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{preferential}} Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States, the {{two countries}} alone or with others, has been examined closely and left on the shelf {{several times in the}} past two decades. 2 It has been examined closely because Australia and the United States share many strategic and economic interests, and it is intuitively attractive to reflect these shared interests in special <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements.</b> It has been left on the shelf for several reasons, the most compelling of which is that it is hard politically for the United States to accept clean free trade with Australia except in the context of multilateral free trade.
