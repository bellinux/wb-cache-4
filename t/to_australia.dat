5|$|Like {{the other}} {{units of the}} 1st Training Wing, No.6 Squadron {{continued}} to train pilots {{after the end of}} the war. This was undertaken to keep personnel occupied while they awaited transport back <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> as well as to strengthen the AFC. No.6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919, and its personnel left Minchinhampton to return <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> on 6 May that year.|$|E
5|$|A convoy {{to return}} the 9th Division <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> was {{assembled}} in the Red Sea near Massawa from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February and, after refuelling at Addu Atoll, arrived safely at the Western Australian port of Fremantle on 18 February. Four of the transport ships continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at Melbourne on 25 February and the remainder arriving at Sydney two days later. After its return <b>to</b> <b>Australia,</b> the 9th Division made {{an important contribution to}} operations in New Guinea during late 1943.|$|E
5|$|Africa {{separated}} from Antarctica around 160million years ago, {{followed by the}} Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected <b>to</b> <b>Australia)</b> still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with marsupial fauna and an extensive temperate rainforest.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his American university career, Tonelli returned <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> and gained selection {{for his second}} Olympics. Having cleared the political obstacles, Tonelli was given a heavy schedule of six events: both backstroke races, the 100m freestyle and butterfly, and two relays. He made little impact in the individual events, only reaching one final. Australia lacked butterfly swimmers and Tonelli was versatile, so he swum the stroke in the medley relay. He performed above his previous record, posting a time fast enough to win silver in the corresponding individual event and helping Australia to an unexpected win. Upon returning <b>to</b> <b>Australia,</b> Tonelli retired with eleven individual Australian championships in three different strokes.|$|E
5|$|After his demobilisation, Smith {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> {{with his}} wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in Melbourne's Jewish community, was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the United Australia Party in the 1931 general election.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel <b>to</b> <b>Australia,</b> via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam <b>to</b> <b>Australia.</b>|$|E

He started the Sheffield Shield season with 11 in an innings victory over South Australia, and scored fifties in three consecutive matches, before rounding off the season with 116 in the final match against Western Australia.|$|E

In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment <b>to</b> <b>Australia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the Japanese surrender, the 27th Battalion ceased {{operations}} and was transported to Torokina, {{where they had}} to wait for shipping to become available for repatriation back <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> to begin the demobilisation process. This process began in October 1945, albeit slowly, and gradually the battalion's numbers decreased as men were repatriated back <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> or were transferred to other units for further service. Long service men received priority for discharge, while some men volunteered to be transferred to the battalions of the 34th Brigade that were being formed on Morotai Island for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Finally, on 1 May 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of hostilities, the battalion's personnel were returned <b>to</b> <b>Australia</b> in small drafts, as the 2/1st undertook garrison duties in the Balikpapan area. The longer-serving men were repatriated and discharged early, while volunteers were transferred to other units that were being raised {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force that would be deployed to Japan. In November, a batch of men were transferred to the 21st Brigade for occupation duties in the Celebes as the Australian forces began preparing to hand over the territories to Dutch authorities. By December, the battalion consisted of less than fifty personnel, {{and at the end of}} the month this cadre embarked upon the transport Kings Point Victory to make the journey back <b>to</b> <b>Australia.</b> The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 26 January 1946.|$|E
