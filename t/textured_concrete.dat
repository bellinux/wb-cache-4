It was built of dyed and <b>textured</b> <b>concrete</b> forms cast from Dinosaur Mountain just outside Morrison, Colorado. Hidden moats replaced cage bars, and native plants and an artificial stream enhanced the natural look. The two main exhibits originally housed polar bears and grizzly bears. The south tip of the exhibit was designed to resemble Mesa Verde National Park. Originally it housed monkeys, but due to escape problems sea lions were housed there instead. Between 1941 and 1961 it housed a female polar [...] bear named Velox, who became the mascot of the 31st U.S. Infantry Regiment in 1952. Velox died at the zoo in 1961 and a memorial stone for her is displayed at the zoo. Bear Mountain established Denver {{as one of the}} foremost among American zoos, and the Saint Louis Zoo hired Borcherdt after seeing the exhibit.|$|E

2500|$|Considered {{an example}} of Wright's pre-Columbian or early Modernist architecture, Storer House {{is one of four}} textile-block houses he built in Southern California, the others being the Millard House, the Samuel Freeman House and the Ennis House.

He sought to develop an inexpensive and simple method of construction that would enable ordinary people to build their own homes with stacked blocks, tied together with steel rods. One writer has described Wright's concept this way: [...] "By unifying decoration and function, exterior and interior, earth and sky -- perforated blocks served as skylights -- Wright saw his Textile Block Method approach as an utterly modern, and democratic, expression of his organic architecture ideal." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} itself {{was built in}} the 19th century and originally housed the Westover Methodist Church. It was later sold to the Orthodox Church, at which time it underwent significant alterations to bring it to the architectural standards necessary for an Orthodox house of worship.

50|$|The Brunton Theatre is a mid-scale {{performing}} arts venue in Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland. It {{is part of}} a wider complex, incorporating council offices, and called Brunton Memorial Hall. The building is <b>textured</b> <b>concrete</b> and glass, and was designed by William Kininmonth, with a gilded relief sculpture by Tom Whalen on the facade. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother opened it in 1971. The name derives from John D. Brunton, son of the founder of the Brunton Wireworks. He died in 1951 and left a bequest of £700,000 to the people of Musselburgh for the purpose of creating a community hall. The Town Council supplemented this and created a larger scheme which incorporated their offices.|$|E
25|$|City Hall was {{constructed}} using mainly cast-in-place and precast Portland cement concrete and some masonry. About {{half of the}} concrete used in the building was precastroughly 22,000 separate componentsand the other half was poured-in-place concrete. All of the concrete used in the structure, excluding that of the columns, is mixed with a light, coarse rock. While {{the majority of the}} building is created using concrete, precast and poured-in-place concrete are distinguishable by their different colors and textures. For example, cast-in-place elements are coarse and grainy <b>textured</b> because the <b>concrete</b> was poured into fir wood frames to mold it, while precast elements, such as trusses and supports, were set in steel molds to gain smooth, clean surfaces. This distinction can also be seen {{in the fact that the}} exterior poured-in-place pieces are of type I cement, a lightly colored cement, while the exterior precast components use type II cement, a dark colored cement. The base of the building is dark with brick, Welsh quarry tiles, mahogany walls, and darker concrete. As the building ascends, the overall color lightens, as lighter concrete is used.|$|R

Alderman Morris, then Mayor of Brighton, laid the foundation stone on 22 October 1947 and the first children attended on 3 September 1948. The school is built on a natural west-facing slope and was constructed in a revolutionary design using pre-cast concrete. The exterior remained unpainted grey <b>textured</b> <b>concrete</b> for many years.

50|$|The façade of the Tanghalang Pambansa is {{dominated}} by a two-storey travertine block suspended 12 m high by deep concave cantilevers on three sides. The rest of the structure is clad in <b>concrete,</b> <b>textured</b> by crushed seashells originally found on the reclamation site. The building is built on a massive podium, and entry is through a vehicular ramp {{in front of the}} raised lobby and a pedestrian side entry on its northwest side. In front of the façade and below the ramp, there is an octagonal reflecting pool with fountains and underwater lights. On the main lobby, three large Capiz-shell chandeliers hang from the third floor ceiling, each symbolizing the three main geographical divisions of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. At the orchestra entrance, a brass sculpture, The Seven Arts by Vicente Manansala welcomes the audience into the main theater. From the pedestrian entrance, Arturo Luz's Black and White is displayed as spectators enter the little theater or ascend to the main lobby through a massive carpeted spiral staircase. Most of the interior is lit artificially, as there are few windows, most of which are located along the sides of the main lobby. Large areas on the upper floors are open to the ground floor lobby, emphasizing the large chandeliers and fluid interior spaces on northeast side of the building. Galleries and other rooms surround these open areas, occupying the space created by the huge cantilevered block. Whenever possible, the walls surrounding these rooms are used as additional venues for displaying art works.|$|R

50|$|Euro Capital {{received}} the construction permits for its now $100 million renovation in May 2014. Architect Bahram Kamali of BBGM said the renovation will completely replace the electrical, HVAC, mechanical, and plumbing (fresh water and sewage) systems. The renovation now featured two new restaurants, upgraded ballrooms, {{and a new}} spa and fitness area. The meeting space, which was quite small by industry standards, was expanded to 17000 sq ft, and the ballroom enlarged slightly to 7000 sq ft. Watergate officials said the new rooftop bar will seat 350, and other internal structural changes will add nearly 100 guest rooms. Kamali said the interior will feature high-quality, expensive plaster, stone, and wood finishes, but the exterior's iconic <b>textured</b> <b>concrete</b> balconies will remain unchanged except for repairs, repainting, and new windows.

The new, modern building emerges from the ground just west of Booth Street and rises progressively higher at its eastern end, closest to Parliament Hill. Its <b>textured</b> <b>concrete</b> walls and roof are somewhat reminiscent of a bunker, while a partially grass-covered roof is consistent with the Museum's theme of regeneration and its environmentally friendly design.

The small windows on the fin spell out in Morse code [...] "Lest we forget" [...] and its French equivalent, [...] "N'oublions jamais".

Beyond the southern-most bay the chancel is lit by fixed, steel framed glazing with deep reveals. The vestries project beneath these windows. The rear wall is windowless and has a field of projecting headers with a large central cross formed by projecting bricks. The vestry walls do not have projecting bricks and are rendered and painted.The church entrance is a simple, open, painted concrete portico.
