5|$|Nevertheless, {{since then}} the tulip has become indelibly {{associated}} with the Netherlands and all things Dutch. {{it was during this}} period that the tulipiere, a ceramic vase for growing <b>tulips</b> indoors was devised, and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete with images of <b>tulips.</b> Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on <b>tulips</b> is The Black Tulip by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.|$|E

5|$|By 1636 the tulip bulb {{became the}} fourth leading export {{product of the}} Netherlands, after gin, {{herrings}} and cheese. The price of <b>tulips</b> skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who never saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight.|$|E
5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting <b>tulips</b> with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the still life studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to <b>tulips</b> from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E

5|$|Original Tulipa {{species can}} be {{obtained}} for ornamental purposes, such as Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica. These {{are referred to as}} species, or botanical, <b>tulips,</b> and tend to be smaller plants but better at naturalising than the cultivated forms. Breeding programs have produced a wide range of tulip types, enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early, mid- and late spring varieties. Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical <b>tulips,</b> including Lily-flowered, Fringed, Viridiflora and Rembrandt. In addition to blooming season, tulip varieties differ in shape, and height, and exhibit a wide range of colours, both pure and in combination.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for <b>tulips</b> collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase <b>tulips</b> at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tulips</b> {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, <b>tulips</b> bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy <b>tulips</b> {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E

5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in <b>tulips</b> was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} <b>tulips</b> were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E

Lilium species may be food plants for the Cosmia trapezina moth. A major pest of <b>Tulips</b> is the fungus, Botrytis tulipae.|$|E
5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636–37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of <b>tulips</b> ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may have helped create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.|$|E

Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. <b>Tulips</b> can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of Fritillaria.
