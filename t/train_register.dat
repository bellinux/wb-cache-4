25|$|This {{disastrous}} collision {{was thus}} due to want of discipline {{on the part}} of the signalmen, first by changing duty at an unauthorised hour, which caused Tinsley to be occupied in writing up the <b>Train</b> <b>Register</b> Book, and so diverted his attention from his proper work, secondly by Meakin handing over the duty in a very lax manner; and, thirdly by both signalmen neglecting to carry out various rules specially framed for preventing accidents due to forgetfulness {{on the part of}} signalmen.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the two signalling errors, another important precaution designed specifically to prevent such errors also failed to be implemented on the day - Rule 55. Under this rule, if any train was stopped on the main line for longer than three minutes, the driver must send one of the crew to the signal box to remind the signaller {{of the presence of}} the train, and to ensure that all safeguards to protect the train (such as slides or collars on the signal levers) were in place, with the crewman then obliged to sign the <b>train</b> <b>register</b> to confirm this.|$|E
2500|$|To {{avoid this}} {{malpractice}} being detected by company management, whoever {{was working the}} night shift would record all train movements after 6.00 am {{on a piece of}} paper rather than the <b>train</b> <b>register.</b> When his replacement arrived, he would copy the entries from the paper into the <b>train</b> <b>register</b> in his own handwriting, making it appear that the shift change had occurred at the correct time. [...] The need for signalman Tinsley to complete the missing <b>train</b> <b>register</b> entries may have distracted him from checking that all of the necessary procedures had been carried out by Meakin before the handover of the box.|$|E
40|$|This non-experimental, descriptive, {{quantitative}} survey {{attempted to}} evaluate IMCI implementation in the eThekwini district of KwaZulu -Natal. The {{study focused on}} IMCI implementation by IMCI <b>trained</b> <b>registered</b> nurses, health facility support and follow-up and supervision.

2500|$|The legal {{position}} was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, {{some of the}} injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. [...] In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability {{on the part of}} anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide. [...] In England the coroner investigated death and, if the coroner's jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. [...] The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. [...] The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation. [...] After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept <b>train</b> <b>register,</b> they could not have forgotten the stationary train.
