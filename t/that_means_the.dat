25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, {{with the same}} {{percentage}} of life bar. For example, some of these games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) {{it is virtually impossible}} for a round to end tied, and <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E
