5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) must {{appear before}} Congress to discuss NBC's merger with the fictitious company network KableTown (a parody of Comcast). He hopes {{that he will}} charm celebrity members for the deal to go through, but one Congresswoman (Latifah) demands more {{diversity}} in the NBC programming lineup. As a result, Jack enlists Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> new development ideas. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), the head writer of the fictitious sketch show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) is {{fed up with the}} criticism her writing staff gives her, and finally Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) helps Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) reapply in the competitive NBC page program.|$|E
25|$|In July 1996, five consortia {{were awarded}} $1m <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> concepts. Three {{received}} follow-on contracts in January 1997, but the Navy had lost {{enthusiasm for the}} project with Boorda's suicide in May 1996, and in April 1997 the Arsenal Ship was redesignated as the Maritime Fire Support Demonstrator (MFSD), {{which would be a}} technology demonstrator for a revitalised SC-21 program. As a result, Congress cut funding to the project and it was finally canceled in October 1997. The Arsenal Ship concept was revived in 2002 by converting four Ohio-class submarines into SSGNs carrying 154 VLS tubes.|$|E
25|$|Portal {{had been}} under {{development}} for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had fun with the game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> type of narrative, coming down to creating an antagonist that would guide the player in {{early part of the}} game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found {{that they did not have}} enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.|$|E

500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} before the band {{settled on the}} eponymous name. Kretz explained, [...] "We've always tried {{to come up with}} very witty and interesting names for our records and we just felt that it was time, 18 years into the Stone Temple Pilots career, to put out a self-titled album." [...] Robert agreed that the new title was a testament to the [...] "new chapter" [...] in the band's career. Weiland also felt the band was starting over and thought the music expressed this on its own. [...] "We don't need <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> major conceptual title. The image on the cover and the music speak for themselves." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics." ...|$|E

500|$|Composing team Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori scored Reach. O'Donnell wrote [...] "somber, more visceral" [...] music {{since the}} plot is character-driven and focuses on a planet that is already known—in the Halo fictional universe—to have fallen. The first music he wrote for Reach was played for the game's world premiere, and he {{used it as a}} {{starting}} piece to develop further themes. [...] O'Donnell began work on Reach while ODST, for which he also wrote the music, was still in production, but did not begin composing until August 2009. Past Halo collaborators Salvatori, C. Paul Johnson, and Stan LePard assisted O'Donnell. With Reach, he did not give them strictly divided responsibilities. [...] "I decided this time <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> themes, tempos, keys, and other basic starting points for musical ideas," [...] explained O'Donnell. [...] "I shared these with all the other composers and just asked them to take off if they felt inspired by any of that material." [...] The works-in-progress they came up with were either retouched by O'Donnell or sent back to be finished by their composer.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{being the}} series premiere, {{features}} the first {{usage of the}} theme song by pop punk band Nerf Herder. Parry Gripp, the band's songwriter, guitarist, and admitted fan of the show explained that the band created the theme song after [...] "fancy pants Hollywood" [...] failed to write a theme song that the producers approved. Eventually, [...] "they [...] asked a bunch of local, small time bands who they could pay very little money <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> ideas and they liked our idea and they used it." [...] Several songs by the band Sprung Monkey play during the episode. When Buffy is deciding what to wear, the song [...] "Saturated" [...] is playing faintly in the background. At The Bronze, the band plays their songs [...] "Believe", [...] "Swirl", and [...] "Things are Changing". All of the songs featured in the episode {{can be found on}} their 1995 album Swirl. The score for the episode, as well as all first season entries, was created by Walter Murphy.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Phair {{worked on}} several album tracks with {{songwriter}} Michael Penn as the producer. When she submitted the finished Penn-produced album to Capitol, the label {{gave it a}} lukewarm reception and was unwilling to release it as submitted.

Phair's collaboration with the Matrix resulted in only four songs, but much of the media attention focused solely on the Matrix-produced tracks, which were a departure from her earlier work. The album received many negative reviews, especially from the independent music press, who accused Phair of [...] "selling out" [...] by making the record very pop-oriented.|$|E

2500|$|A former RUC {{assistant}} chief constable told the Tribunal that Breen and Buchanan {{had been warned}} against going to Dundalk at a meeting on 16 March 1989, but that they had disobeyed orders. Breen's widow, however, denied that her late husband had attended the meeting as he had spent that day with her, and Breen's diary recorded that on 16 March he was on leave. The security conference with Gardaí in Dundalk {{had been set up}} after a dinner at Stormont House on 6 March, which had been attended by both Breen and Buchanan. It was there that Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Tom King had suggested the meeting after receiving reports from a British Army colonel about the cross-border smuggling activities of a well-known IRA man whose property straddled the Armagh/Louth border. According to Sgt Alan Mains, Breen was [...] "specifically directed to speak with the Guards [...] and the Army, and <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> kind of reply for the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State". Breen allegedly had much information about the smuggler. A former RUC Special Branch chief, however stated to the Tribunal that both Breen and Buchanan had been opposed to carrying out [...] "Operation Amazing" [...] against the smuggler as there was not enough substantial information on which to base it. When it was suggested to Tom King that the proposed operation was [...] "ill-advised and dangerous", he reportedly struck the table and insisted that it was to go ahead.|$|E
