Most of the South was in desperate need of infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in <b>this</b> <b>respect.</b> He raised taxes, tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and flooded the state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and drove up the state debt.|$|E

In <b>this</b> <b>respect,</b> Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It {{was in the}} Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School, founded under Boris, that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated {{during the reign of}} Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there.|$|E

However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E

He wrote several biographies; his works on Johan Sverdrup and Henrik Ibsen spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian nation.
