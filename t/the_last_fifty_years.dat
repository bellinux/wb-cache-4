5|$|There are {{specific}} instances where properties {{usually do not}} merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties that have achieved significance during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified {{in one of those}} groups to be included.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years,</b> rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>lasts</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>the</b> {{tremendous}} {{evolution of}} modern technologies has gradually unbalanced the equilibrium between {{the production and}} the consumption of energy. Traditional energy resources, like coal, oil and natural gases, are no longer sufficient to satisfy the demand of energy without spoiling earth environment. Renewable energies have attracted {{a lot of attention}} because they are potential solution to this important problem. In particular photovoltaic solar cells are considered the most promising technology for a low-cost and environmentally friendly energy production. However, in order to exploit these technologies in real world applications, the complete physics of solar cells must be understood. Stability is one of the fundamental aspects and is related to the processes that regulate the energy conversion, both in long-term degradation as well in electrical stability. In this work the stability of two emerging categories of solar cells is thoroughly addressed: organic photovoltaics and organometal-halide perovskite. In organic photovoltaics understanding the stability and degradation mechanisms of photoactive blends is required to achieve long device lifetimes.

50|$|Because of {{the changes}} in the Earth's climate over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> million <b>years,</b> soils formed under {{tropical}} rainforest (or even savanna) have become exposed to increasingly arid climates which cause former oxisols, ultisols or even alfisols to dry out in such a manner that a very hard crust is formed. This process has occurred so extensively in most parts of Australia as to restrict soil development - the former soil is effectively the parent material for a new soil, but it is so unweatherable that only a very poorly developed soil can exist in present dry climates, especially when they have become much drier during glacial periods in the Quaternary.|$|R
25|$|The town {{is at the}} {{junction}} of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals, a location which proved key to it's growth as a centre of heavy industry during the Industrial Revolution.

Regular replacement of worn parts can therefore extend a piano's lifetime by decades - even indefinitely, provided that the piano's structural support (i.e. the frame) remains sound (and sometimes the frame can also be repaired).|$|R
25|$|The Houtman Abrolhos {{maintains}} a breeding population of Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea), probably numbering between 75 and 100. Historical data suggests numbers were previously much higher; for example, in 1727 {{survivors of the}} Zeewyk shipwreck killed over 150 sea lions in the Southern Group alone. This {{has led to a}} 1727 population estimate of between 290 and 580 animals for the entire Houtman Abrolhos. Populations apparently fell dramatically between the 1840s and the 1880s, largely due to extensive commercial sealing in the area. In addition to direct killing of the animals, it is likely that much of the mangrove habitat on the islands was cleared as fuel for trypots, and this may have affected the survival of young pups. Populations are thought to have been fairly stable for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years,</b> although the lack of genetic diversity in the smaller population remains of concern, as does climate change.|$|E
25|$|Certain breeds of cattle, {{such as the}} Holstein-Friesian, {{are used}} to produce milk, which can be {{processed}} into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product. For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered {{at a young age}} to produce veal. They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. Over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years,</b> dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK, Europe and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Colombia–United States {{relations}} are the bilateral {{relations between the}} Republic of Colombia and the United States of America. The {{relationship between the two}} states evolved from mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries to a recent partnership that links the governments of both nations around several key issues; this includes fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and the threat of terrorism due to the September 11 attacks in 2001. During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years,</b> different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the issues already stated. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia. Supporters, such as Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, defend the idea that the United States has promoted respect for human rights {{and the rule of law}} in Colombia; in addition, adding to the fight against drugs and terrorism.|$|E

50|$|These motives {{prompted}} the Portuguese {{to develop the}} Guinea trade. They made gradual progress down the African coast, each voyage reaching a point further along than <b>the</b> <b>last.</b> After <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> of coastal exploration, the Portuguese finally reached Elmina in 1471, {{during the reign of}} King Afonso V. However, because Portuguese royalty had lost interest in African exploration as a result of meager returns, the Guinea trade was put under the oversight of the Portuguese trader, Fernão Gomes. Upon reaching present day Elmina, Gomes discovered a thriving gold trade already established among the natives and visiting Arab and Berber traders. He established his own trading post, and it became known to the Portuguese as “A Mina” (the Mine) because of the gold that could be found there.|$|R
