5|$|Further {{testing of}} Silverplate B-29 {{aircraft}} and Thin Man and Fat Man bomb shapes {{was carried out}} at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944. Testing shifted to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, in October. Project Y controlled the scheduling and contents of the tests, which were {{carried out by the}} Flight Test Section of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit as Project W-47. The tests were supervised by Ramsey until November, when Commander Frederick Ashworth became Parson's head of operations, and assumed responsibility for the <b>test</b> <b>program.</b> The test bombs were assembled by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Special Ordnance Detachment. Tests continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. At first only the Ordnance Division's fuse and delivery groups were involved, but as the tests became more detailed, and live explosives were incorporated into the test bombs, other groups were drawn into the <b>test</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field <b>test</b> <b>program.</b> In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

40|$|Software-based {{self-test}} (SBST) {{techniques are}} used to test processors against permanent faults introduced by the manufacturing process (often as a complementary approach with respect to DfT) or to perform in-field test in safety-critical applications. A major obstacle to their adoption is the high cost for developing effective <b>test</b> <b>programs,</b> since {{there is still a}} lack of suitable EDA algorithms and tools able to automatically generate SBST <b>test</b> <b>programs.</b> An efficient ATPG algorithm can serve as the foundation for the automatic generation of SBST <b>test</b> <b>programs.</b> In this work we first highlight the additional constraints characterizing SBST <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> wrt functional ones, with special emphasis on their usage for in-field test; then, we describe an ATPG framework targeting stuck-at faults based on Bounded Model Checking. The framework allows the user to exibly specify the requirements of SBST <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> in the considered scenario. Finally, we demonstrate how a set of properly chosen requirements can be used to generate <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> matching these constraints. In our experiments we evaluate the framework with the miniMIPS microprocessor. The results show that the proposed method is the first able to automatically generate SBST <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> whose fault efficiency is superior to those produced with state-of-the-art manual approaches...|$|R

As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft.

Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0.
