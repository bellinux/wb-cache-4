5|$|Also in 1404, Władysław held <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, {{who offered}} to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław {{supported}} {{him in his}} power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was still}} {{actively}} involved in charity work after turning 110. An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, and to her positive attitude towards life.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{concluded}} the trial period at Blackburn {{by agreeing to}} a three-month pay-as-you-play deal. He stated that {{he was eager to}} return to the Premier League and that his pre-existing relationship with Ince would not earn him any preferential treatment. He made his first appearance against Everton in a 1–0 win in the League Cup on 24 September. With a month left on his contract at Blackburn, Fowler received interest from League Two side Grimsby Town. Fowler, a noted friend of then Grimsby manager Mike Newell had held <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> Blundell Park over a possible Player/Coach role with the club.|$|E

He {{was admitted to the}} French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1985, and the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1986. He was the recipient of the 22nd Suntory Music Award (1990). Takemitsu was posthumously awarded the fourth Glenn Gould Prize in Autumn, 1996.|$|E
5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E

5|$|He and Sharif {{agreed in}} a 9 March 2008 agreement, {{known as the}} Murree Declaration, to the {{reinstatement}} by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf. The deadline was later extended to 12 May. He and Sharif held unsuccessful <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> London in May. After the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, the PML-N withdrew from the government in mid-May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet. The coalition regrouped, again with the PML-N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove {{the power of the}} President to dismiss Parliament. By late May, the coalition was set in a confrontation with Musharraf. At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E
5|$|Now back in Austria, Metternich {{witnessed}} {{first hand}} the Austrian army's defeat at the Battle of Wagram. Stadion tendered his resignation as Foreign Minister in the aftermath, and the Emperor immediately offered the post to Metternich. Metternich, worried that Napoleon would seize on this to demand harsher peace terms, instead agreed {{to become a}} minister of state (which he did on 8 July) and to lead negotiations with the French on the understanding that he would replace Stadion as Foreign Minister at a later date. During peace <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked {{his position on the}} future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, as Foreign Minister (and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household). In early 1810 Metternich's earlier affair with Junot became public but, because of Eleonore's understanding, the scandal was minimal.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{analysis}} has indicated Overton {{may have been}} treated unfairly for these actions, becoming a scapegoat {{for the actions of}} many other pilots in the war. No new policies had been released warning about crossing the Chinese border, and no pilots before Overton had been punished for doing so. Overton himself expressed frustration at the move, as he had been the rearmost pilot in the formation that crossed the Yalu River on 24 January, and Mitchell himself had been known to cross the border and condoned the action. Fellow ace and unit member Francis Gabreski challenged the move, claiming that US pilots were outnumbered and {{it was the only way}} to maintain air superiority. It was later revealed that Swiss observers to the peace <b>talks</b> <b>at</b> Panmunjon were traveling through Manchuria on foot when they spotted a UN-Soviet dogfight and lodged a complaint, prompting an investigation which eventually indicted Overton.|$|E
