The highway proceeds through the southern {{portion of the}} village and crosses Skaneateles Creek to reach a junction with South Main Street. NY317 turns north onto Main Street and has intersections with Mechanic Street (CR60) and North Hamilton Street (designated as CR271 south of Jordan) before it terminates at a junction with NY31 north of the village center but within the village limits.|$|E
5|$|M-90 in the Lower Peninsula {{replaced}} the M-38 designation between M-36 near North Branch and M-19 near Melvin. In 1930, when M-24 was extended north, M-90 was extended west <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> the new highway north of Lapeer. The eastern end was extended in 1934 to US Highway 25 in Lexington. The final gravel {{segment of the}} highway was paved in 1957 in Sanilac County.|$|E
5|$|After this transfer, {{the roadway}} carried the CR492 designation. In 1964, several {{abandoned}} underground mine shafts collapsed underneath M-35 in Negaunee, and M-35 was rerouted {{out of the}} city along its current roadway through Negaunee Township, connecting with CR492. The eastern end of CR492 was moved by 2001. Before this realignment, CR492 followed Brookton Road, parallel to US41/M-28 before turning to the previous terminus just west of the border between Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. After the change, CR492 turned north <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> the highway opposite of Wright Street. The CR492 designation was extended along Wright Street at the same time. In 2006, the city of Marquette extended Wright Street to end at Lakeshore Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{crosses the}} marshy Little River {{and enters the}} town of Little Creek, where it becomes Main Street and is lined with residences.

The road continues northwest through farmland with some trees and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of Chandelle Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 17th century coal was largely {{obtained}} by excavating the outcrops and driving drifts which followed the seam into the ground.

This area is {{the western edge of}} Saginaw's suburbs. Along the road towards Freeland, there are periodic small farms in between small residential subdivisions. In the community of Freeland, M-47 runs near the MBS International Airport off Freeland Road. North of town, M-47 leaves Midland Road and becomes a freeway near Tittabawassee Park. The freeway section of M-47 runs through rural farm land. There is a diamond interchange with Salzburg Road before the terminal interchange at US10.|$|E
5|$|M-98 {{started at}} a {{junction}} with M-77 in Germfask {{next to the}} Seney National Wildlife Refuge, a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County. The highway followed Ten Curves Road east and then north out town. The trunkline turned back due east and crosses the Fox River before a set of curves that shifted the highway along the Schoolcraft–Luce county line to pass north of Big Manistique Lake. Ten Curves Road passes between the Big and North Manistee lakes as it enters the community of Helmer in Luce County. There, M-98 intersected M-135, and the two ran concurrently north along Manistique Lakes Road. M-98/M-135 turned due east <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> M-28 southwest of McMillan near East Lake.|$|E
5|$|SR11, named Chuckanut Drive for its whole route, {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-5 north of Burlington.

5|$|The first {{interchange}} on the Cherokee Turnpike is with SH-82 in Locust Grove. The turnpike continues east, passing into Delaware County, <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> US-412 Alternate again between Rose and Leach. East of this interchange, {{a service}} area {{lies in the}} median of the roadway; east of there, the highway passes through the Cherokee Turnpike's only mainline toll plaza. The turnpike's final interchange is with US-59 and SH-10 in Kansas. The Cherokee Turnpike then ends, merging with US-59; at this junction, US-412 Alternate, which was concurrent with US-59, also ends. US-59 and US-412 continue southeast through Flint, before turning due east to West Siloam Springs. There, US-59 splits away from US-412, while US-412 remains on an easterly trajectory, crossing the state line into Siloam Springs, Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
5|$|H-58 {{follows a}} gravel roadway through the forested northwestern corner of Luce County. The roadway turns northeasterly and runs closer to Lake Superior as it {{approaches}} Deer Park. The road also carries the County Road407 (CR407) designation {{and the name}} Grand Marais Truck Trail. Near the Blind Sucker Flooding, a man-made reservoir, the truck trail turns south <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> Deer Park Road. H-58 turns east on Deer Park Road and runs between Rainy and Reedy lakes {{to the south and}} Lake Superior to the north. The east end of H-58 is at an intersection with H-37 near Muskallonge Lake State Park in Deer Park, north of Newberry. Deer Park is the location of a trio of resorts and remnants of a community that once included a sawmill, hotel and store. The state park is located on the shore of Muskallonge Lake and is visited by about 71,000people each year.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park <b>to</b> <b>intersect</b> with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

40|$|The Great Whin and Midland Valley {{dolerite}} sill complexes {{appear to}} have been emplaced laterally from the walls of feeder dykes. The overall thickness of each sill increases with depth, as would be expected if the magma finally reached a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. Variations in the thickness of the sills with estimated intrusion depth imply that the head of magma was about 100 m below the contemporary ground surface in the areas of the present-day outcrops {{at the end of the}} intrusive episodes. Before hydrostatic equilibrium was established, the magma pressure would probably have been somewhat greater, so it is likely that intrusion of the sills was accompanied by the extrusion of flood basalts. Step-and-stair transgressions of the bedding are commonly found within the sills, mostly stepping downwards in the direction of bedding dip. The reason for this directionality is that the weight of sediments floating on an intruding sill has a downdip component that applies a tensile stress <b>to</b> <b>intersecting</b> fractures below the sill when magma is moving downdip, and <b>to</b> <b>intersecting</b> fractures above the sill when magma is moving updip...|$|R
