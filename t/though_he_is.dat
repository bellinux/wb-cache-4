5000|$|... "Training in {{morals and}} good conduct {{is far more}} {{important}} than book learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> ignorant is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The {{reason for this is that}} the child who conducts himself well, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light." ...|$|R

5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted.

The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs.
