Thus if the first witnesses testified that one person killed another, and other witnesses testified that the victim or the alleged murderer was with the other witnesses on that day in a particular place, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not condemn the first witnesses as perjurers. But if the other witnesses testified that the first witnesses were with the other witnesses on that day in a particular place, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> condemn the first witnesses as perjurers and executed the first witnesses on the other witnesses' evidence.|$|E
500|$|Differences {{were made}} between the {{original}} webisodes and the first episodes of the season. One example is the introduction of Druitt. In the webisodes, Druitt murders a prostitute after arriving in Old City, but in the pilot, writer Damian Kindler included dialogue between the two characters before Druitt murders her, {{as a way of}} proving to the audience how evil he is. Another is the ending of [...] "Fata Morgana", where the Morrígan leave the Sanctuary with the Cabal mercenaries; in the webisodes, the sisters escape. Druitt directly tells Ashley in one of the first webisodes that he is her father. In the first season, the producers decided that she would not be aware of this until midway through, and even <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want Druitt to tell her directly, but rather hint it to her, so that Ashley can pick up the pieces herself.|$|E
500|$|It was {{apparent}} that women would eventually be allowed {{to serve in the}} Navy: the question was, in what form? [...] The quandary for the Navy was how to administer a woman's program, yet fashion it to its own liking. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> what they had often done before, turn to academia for help. This time the Navy asked women educators for assistance, first contacting Dr. Virginia C. Gildersleeve, [...] dean of Barnard College. [...] She suggested that Professor Elizabeth Reynard, also of Barnard, become a special assistant to Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, Chief of Naval Personnel. [...] Reynard was well known for the academic work she had done on women in the work place. But her first-rate performance as Jacob's assistant silenced any fears the Navy may have had about women educators. Reynard quickly formed the Women's Advisory Council to meet with Navy officials. [...] Gildersleeve became the chairperson. Because of her efforts eight prominent women agreed to serve on the council. They included: ...|$|E

50|$|For any field F, if two polynomials p(x),q(x) ∈ Fx are {{relatively}} prime <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not have a}} common root, for if a ∈ F was a common root, then p(x) and q(x) would both be multiples of x &minus; a and therefore {{they would not be}} relatively prime.

50|$|In the {{phenomenology}} of reactance, {{there is}} no assumption that a person will be aware of reactance.

In other words, they will feel that if they are able to <b>do</b> what <b>they</b> want, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have to <b>do</b> what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not want. In this case, when the freedom is in question, that person alone is the director of their own behavior.|$|R
