5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer Stadium. The improvements, which included a new clubhouse for <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> visiting teams beyond the center field wall, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, walkways, and seating, were made {{in order to keep the}} stadium functional for another three to five years.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not be a viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
5|$|In a rare occurrence, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the Indianapolis Indians {{exchanged}} no-hitters on back-to-back nights (August 6 and August 7, 1988). First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo {{combined for}} a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0 Nashville win. Nashville won when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base and third base, {{and then came}} home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong registered a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0 Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games.|$|E

5|$|The intrastate rivalry was {{interrupted}} when Nashville {{moved to the}} American Association in 1985, but was renewed when the Sounds joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the Memphis Redbirds have been division rivals ever since. In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference Northern Division title, finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville which spent {{the majority of the}} season in first place. Similarly, Nashville finished the 2014 season two-and-a-half games behind Memphis after having led the division for most of the season.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E

5|$|Massive {{flooding}} in the Midwest resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the Iowa Cubs {{played a game}} with an official attendance of zero on June 14, 2008. Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a message on the team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
5|$|On May 5–6, 2006, Greer was {{the site}} of a game which tied the record for the longest game, in terms of innings played, in PCL history. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> the New Orleans Zephyrs competed in a 24-inning game, played over the course of two days, which lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes. New Orleans {{defeated}} Nashville by a score of five runs to four. The record was originally set on June 8, 1909 in a game between the San Francisco Seals and Oakland Oaks. A few years later, on September 10, 1911, the record was tied by a contest between the Sacramento Solons and Portland Beavers. Seven PCL records were broken in the game, and three were tied.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>and</b> rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E

5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds {{started the}} 1979 season poorly, before {{rallying}} to win 20 of 31games in late May and June. They entered {{the last day}} of the first half of the season in first place, but lost their game to cross-state rivals the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place. <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>and</b> Chicks met again on {{the last day of}} the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series, two games to one, before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville captured their first Southern League championship by defeating the Astros, three games to one. Schmittou wanted to give each player a $1,000 bonus for winning the pennant, but as that would have been against the National Association's rules, he settled for buying them championship rings instead. Geoff Combe, with a league-leading 27saves, won the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. The Sounds compiled an 83–61 record that season. During the All-Star Break between the halves of the season, Nashville played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. The All-Stars defeated the Braves, five to two. Nashville's Duane Walker was named the game's MVP.|$|E
