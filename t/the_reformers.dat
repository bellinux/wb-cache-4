5|$|The {{elections}} of autumn 1790 {{resulted in a}} new group of deputies joining those already elected. A second Marshal of the Sejm was elected (Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha). As Małachowski was seen as associated with <b>the</b> <b>reformers,</b> Sapieha was initially seen as a conservative, although he would later switch sides and join <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> The doubled number of deputies exceeded the capacity of the parliament chambers, and not all of the deputies could secure a seat; public interest also grew and the entire building and the observation galleries were often overcrowded.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote {{an open letter}} {{at the request of}} Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith. This was followed by an open letter to the pope (Admonitio paterna Pauli III) in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving <b>the</b> <b>reformers</b> of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio in 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith.|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{hydrogen production}} based on methanol-steam reforming (MSR) using a micro-scale cylindrical packed bed <b>reformer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reformer</b> wall {{is included in}} the physical model. The heat required for the reforming reaction is supplied either internally using a heating rod placed along the center of <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> or externally by a heat flux applied at <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> outer wall. Our results show that the thermal resistance from the heat source to <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> environment {{plays an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> performance. This thermal resistance depends on <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> geometry, wall material and heat transfer coefficients inside the catalyst bed and outside <b>the</b> <b>reformer.</b> Based on our numerical results, it is suggested that better methanol conversion and hydrogen yield can be obtained using reformer wall material with low thermal conductivity and thin thickness. For both internal and external heating under the same heat rate supply, no significant difference in reformer performance was found. A water gas shift (WGS) reaction model was included in the present numerical model. In <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> low-temperature zone <b>the</b> forward WGS reaction was clearly demonstrated, resulting in a decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity. In the high temperature zone the backward WGS reaction was also clearly demonstrated in which CO selectivity increases with the increase in temperature. For both internal and external heating under the same heat rate supply, our results indicated that CO selectivity is about thirty times lower when the WGS reaction is neglected.

5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system.

Now their attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} effects on a methanol-steam reforming (MSR) process are numerically investigated using a circular reformer with a partially (referred to as <b>the</b> wall-coated <b>reformer)</b> or entirely filled catalyst layer (referred to as <b>the</b> packed-bed <b>reformer).</b> <b>The</b> catalyst layer is formed by packing CuO/ZnO/Al(2) O(3) catalyst particles {{with a certain}} porosity and permeability. The fluid flow characteristics are strongly affected by the catalyst-layer thickness. As a consequence, the heat and mass transfer also depend on the catalyst-layer thickness. Under heat supplied by wall heat flux conditions, {{it is found that}} higher reforming temperature can be obtained for <b>the</b> wall-coated <b>reformer</b> compared with <b>the</b> packed-bed <b>reformer.</b> This results in <b>the</b> wall-coated <b>reformer</b> having a better methanol conversion efficiency compared with <b>the</b> packed-bed <b>reformer.</b> Based on our study, the minimum {{heat transfer}} coefficient, maximum methanol conversion and maximum carbon monoxide production are obtained when the catalyst-layer thickness is 90 % of <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> radius.

5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states.

The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and <b>the</b> <b>reformers</b> and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of <b>the</b> <b>reformers</b> by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E

After uneventful trips to Orléans and his hometown of Noyon, Calvin returned to Paris in October 1533. During this time, tensions rose at the Collège Royal (later to become the Collège de France) between the humanists/reformers and the conservative senior faculty members. One of <b>the</b> <b>reformers,</b> Nicolas Cop, was rector of the university.

40|$|The methanol-steam {{reforming}} (MSR) {{performance in}} micro-scale tubular reformers made by various materials is numerically studied. The physical domain considered includes an inlet section for methanol-steam mixture supply, a reformer section packed with CuO/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst particles {{and an outlet}} section for reformed gas collection. The heat transfer effect with three different heat supply mechanisms on the MSR performance is addressed. For heat supplies from the applied heat fluxes at <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> outer wall surface and from internal heat generation in <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> wall, {{it is found that}} the axial conduction {{plays an important role in}} both heat transfer characteristics and MSR performance. It is suggested that <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> have a small axial conduction parameter for high MSR performance which can be achieved by designing <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> with low wall thermal conductivity, thin wall thickness and a small reactants feed rate. It is also found that an excess heat supply can be obtained when the axial conduction parameter is small. This excess heat supply enhances the MSR performance compared with <b>the</b> infinitely-thin walled <b>reformer.</b> For <b>the</b> <b>reformer</b> with a constant wall outer surface temperature, the wall material effect on the MSR performance is insignificant due to uniformly distributed reformer wall temperature.

5|$|Edgar {{had been}} a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a {{probably}} unwilling church and nobility, aided by the leading clerics of the day, Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury; Oswald of Worcester, Archbishop of York; and Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. By endowing the reformed Benedictine monasteries with the lands required for their support, he had dispossessed many lesser nobles, and had rewritten leases and loans of land {{to the benefit of}} the monasteries. Secular clergy, many of whom would have been members of the nobility, had been expelled from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported <b>the</b> <b>reformers,</b> but following his death, the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster’s main ally was Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Warwick was {{the most}} fervently and {{consistently}} antagonistic of the earls, and remained so until his early death in 1315. Other earls were more amenable. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, was Gaveston’s brother-in-law and stayed loyal to the king. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, would later {{be one of the}} king’s most central supporters, yet at this point he found the most prudent course of action was to go along with <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> Of the barons, at least Robert Clifford and William Marshall seemed to have royalist leanings.|$|E

5|$|The motive behind Edward's {{change of}} heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good {{position}} to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of <b>the</b> <b>reformers,</b> causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among <b>the</b> <b>reformers.</b> He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
