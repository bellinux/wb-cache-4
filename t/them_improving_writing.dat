Based on this idea, the study aimed at exploring and finding an effective way of using wiki-based collaborative tasks to help students revising and editing their writing piece. This study also looked into students perceptions about the use of wikis to <b>improve</b> <b>writing.</b> Students in the class used wikis to create a better writing piece based on the 6 + 1 Traits of Writing. They worked collaboratively in groups to revise, edit, and give suggestions. Classroom action research was used as the research method for this study. Data analysis was performed using qualitative research to provide descriptions and to identify emerging themes. Credibility of the findings was established by using triangulation of data that includes field notes, students' reflections, questionnaire, member checks, recorded writing developments on the wiki's page history, and interviews. Results seemed congruent with previous research on technology and second language writing. Wikis proved to be an effective tool for the writing process approach as evidenced by the benefits for its use that outweighed the drawbacks. Wiki collaborative tasks gave students different experience on writing process. Instead of working solitarily on their writing, they worked collaboratively in creating a better writing piece. Students learned to negotiate meaning, and also to give and take criticism and suggestions. They learned to use social skill to interact with peers {{in order to create a}} better writing piece. Putting students writing piece on the wiki gave real audience for the students. As such, working on wiki gave incentive for some students to put more efforts on their writing since they realized that other people would read their works.

40|$|Peer {{response}} {{is a method}} which is widely used on higher levels of second-language learning in Sweden, such as universities. The approach is not used as much in upper secondary school; and, {{the aim of this}} paper is to investigate upper secondary students' opinions of the value of peer response. The aim is also to investigate if the teacher's grading differed between the first version of a text and the final vesrion that had been revised after peer response. Research has shown that there seems to be more negotiation of meaning when students are working collaboratively and this can lead to better revisions of written texts, especially in terms of content development. On the other hand, collaborative writing can also create anxiety in some students who therefore dislike peer response. This investigation has shown that students taking part in the investigation are generally positive towards the approach. They also believe that giving and receiving feedback can help <b>them</b> <b>improve</b> their <b>writing.</b> There are, however, a few students who dislike it and want the texts to be read only by the teacher. The investigation has also shown that students mainly focus on formal aspects such as spelling and grammar when giving feedback to each other, whereas content was rarely commented on. Moreover, the results have shown that many of the students' grades improved on the final version compared to the first version. In conclusion, this investigation indicates that peer response could be used as an alternative, or complement, to ordinary teacher-student feedback in upper secondary school...|$|R

But often the value of such support is lost on, especially, first year students, who perceive such support as an indication that they may be 'lacking' in some way.

Worse still is the reality that should students not 'buy into' the idea of such support, or be convinced that such support is valuable, they may not benefit.

30|$|Ten {{students}} {{randomly selected}} from the experimental group were interviewed in Chinese about their perceptions of DDL activities in revising stage. The qualitative interview {{results indicate that the}} interviewees generally show positive attitudes toward the use of BNC web in revision stage of writing. They emphasized that the use of a corpus in the revising stage can help <b>them</b> <b>improve</b> their <b>writing</b> accuracy because the time-consuming DDL activities make them have a better impression of their errors and the correct language patterns. In DDL, it is usually the learners who explore and find out appropriate expressions or collocates relevant to his or her writing. This discovery-oriented process may facilitate their acquisition of the correct language use. The interviewees here show the same opinion with the participants in Chambers’ (2005) study, who claimed that hunting for grammatical patterns in concordance lines better facilitates memorization of problematic aspects of the target language than being “spoon-fed” the language rules. In addition, most of them mentioned that the frequently-occurring collocations presented in Key-Word-in-Context (KWIC) format help them increase the awareness of collocation and thus enables them to use these collocations better in the writing tasks. Due to the interference of the mother tongue, they often associate a verb with a noun wrongly or match a noun arbitrarily with an adjective without considering whether it is appropriate. Now after the corpus consultation activities, they realized it’s better to memorize the collocations or phrases in context rather than the single word. Besides these benefits of DDL activities, some of them still mentioned the following advantages such as discovering some new usages of the known words accidentally, learning other new words incidentally, making them become more autonomous, enlarging their vocabulary.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and {{describe}} teachers 2 ̆ 7 comments written on seventh-graders 2 ̆ 7 compositions and to investigate the relative effects of two types of comments on improvement in writing. ^ Initial data were gathered from nine teachers of seventh-grade English, with data being collected from 180 papers. A taxonomy was developed for the purpose of categorizing and describing comments written on the papers; 1, 475 comments were analyzed. ^ The teacher whose comments were most specific and explicit and the teacher whose comments were least specific and explicit each submitted three additional sets of writing samples during an 8 -month period. A team of three rates used holistic scoring procedures to score the first and last papers submitted by each teacher. Interrater reliability coefficients were significant at the. 01 level. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique for repeated measures was used to test for relative effects of the two types of comments on improvement in writing performance. ^ A significant interaction was found between type of comment and occasion of testing. The analysis and post hoc tests revealed that the group receiving more specific and explicit comments demonstrated significantly greater improvement over time than did the group receiving less specific and explicit comments. ^ Analysis of results seemed to support the follownig conclusions: (1) most comments were written in red, less than 10 words, interlinear, and written as incomplete sentences, (2) the content of the comments was generally neutral in tone, written in plan English or editing symbols, specific, and inexplicit, (3) most comments referred to obvious errors in mechanics and usage found in a single word and marked in the text, (4) improvement in writing performance was sigificantly greater for students receiving more specific and explicit written feedback than for students receiving less specific and explicit comments, and (5) identifying key errors and providing students with sufficient information to make corrections were more effective in helping <b>them</b> to <b>improve</b> <b>writing</b> skills than merely editing or naming mistakes. ...|$|R
