5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} {{she has her own}} {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pair}} {{continued}} {{to express their}} positive feelings for one another, tabloids began writing the opposite. There were claims that the two bore ill will against each other, {{and that they had}} to record the song separately due to constant tension. While media speculation grew as the film's release date drew near, both singers maintained that they had become close friends, and had only the most positive <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about each other.|$|E
5|$|Jenna {{has become}} more famous after gaining weight, and sorts through large amounts of fan mail. Jack congratulates her on her weight, and Jenna enjoys her new {{friendship}} with him. While talking to Liz, Jenna begins to worry about losing weight, and fears her popularity will decline. Upset that Jenna is losing weight, Jack sends Kenneth to follow her around and make sure she keeps her weight on. Liz tells Kenneth to insult Jenna if he wants her to eat more, and writes down a list of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Jenna to hurt her. Jenna takes the insults as compliments, and tries to seduce Kenneth.|$|E

Chris Smith With the Moos was the a-moo-dicator, who would sound a cow's moos when he {{believes}} they have run out of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> It is based loosely around Radio 4 comedy Just a Minute. It began in late 2014.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{was also}} {{interested}} in what some would call sociology in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He objected to their dialectical/evolutionist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, {{as well as their}} narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of positivism was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the neo-Kantian sociology of Georg Simmel, with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of Max Weber, the primary founder of sociological antipositivism. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of nonpositivist verstehende sociology and the Verstehen method.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers did, however, have {{positive}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the game's co-op system, lack of online support notwithstanding. Cameron Lewis of Official Xbox Magazine US, in the summary of his review, noted that [...] "complementary characters make local co-op effective". The UK {{version of the}} magazine called the co-op [...] "pleasant", while X-ONE Magazine felt that the mode gave the game more substance.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Dance for You", Beyoncé, as {{the female}} protagonist, expresses her {{feelings}} to her man {{and tells him}} how devoted she is to him. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "about keeping things hot with her man". Echoing Vena's sentiments, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine described the lyrics as detailing a [...] "triumphantly monogamous relationship". In the first verse, Beyoncé sings about how understanding, loyal, and patient her man is. She further states that she really cares about his heart, {{she has a lot}} of valuable <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and that for all these reasons, she is going to dance for him.|$|E
500|$|Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a {{prominent}} Hegelian, at first criticized the aesthetic section, Either (Part I), {{then he had}} much better <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about Or, Part II. Julie Watkin said [...] "Kierkegaard replied to Heiberg in The Fatherland as Victor Eremita, blaming Heiberg for not reading the preface to Either/Or which would have given him {{the key to the}} work." [...] Kierkegaard later used his book Prefaces to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard and William Godwin were very similar in their criticism of critics. He also published a short article, Who is the Author of Either/Or?, a week after the publication of Either/Or itself.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} met with enthusiasm from the record label; {{according}} to Weezer collaborator Karl Koch, [...] "They had nothing but supportive and excited <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it." [...] However, the album's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo's choice of [...] "Hash Pipe" [...] as the first single. Citing the song's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that [...] "Don't Let Go" [...] be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and [...] "Hash Pipe" [...] eventually became the album's first single. The label tried to postpone the release date further until June, but the band convinced them {{to adhere to the}} original May 15 release date.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|In the B story, Andy (Chris Pratt) still pines for April (Aubrey Plaza), {{who remains}} angry at Andy {{and is now}} dating the {{handsome}} Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). Chris (Rob Lowe) suggests Andy tap into the aspects of his personality April was attracted to in the first place. However, the only things he can think of are that he is nice and {{he is in a}} band. Andy decides to be nice to Eduardo, and the two realize they have similar musical tastes (they both like the Dave Matthews Band) and end up bonding over a guitar session. April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy had nothing but positive <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about her. The episode ends with the Pawnee residents [...] including Kelly and his daughter [...] watching an outdoor screening of the Twilight film.|$|E

500|$|DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire {{noted in}} a review that while the tenth season {{contains}} [...] "a lot of laughs", it is missing the emotional core of the earlier seasons. Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com has commented that around the time the tenth season aired, [...] "not only did the show start losing its status as untouchable—read: everyone stopped expecting every episode to be a masterpiece—it also developed the bad habit of building episodes around celebrity guests, who were practically never as amusing as {{they were meant to}} be." [...] Michael Passman of The Michigan Daily wrote in 2007 that [...] "in hindsight, the 10th season can now be seen as a tipping point of sorts for a number of the show's less attractive plot devices. Homer's get-rich-quick schemes start to become all too prevalent, and there are an inordinate amount of unnecessary celebrity cameos." [...] Passman did not only have negative <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the tenth season though. He commented that it [...] "is not the last great 'Simpsons' season ever. The last great season was the eighth. The last really good season was the ninth. But the tenth is just pretty good, nothing more, nothing less." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin McNeese of NewReleaseTuesday {{gave the}} album {{five out of}} five stars, opining that [...] " [...] takes the formula that MercyMe has perfected and drop kicks it out of Mr. Lovewell's window". [...] Roger Gelwicks of Jesus Freak Hideout was even less positive, opining that [...] "MercyMe is still {{on top of their}} game... however, The Generous Mr. Lovewell is undeniably a pretty forgettable record, and while there are a few gems to be found, it's only going to appeal to the already-existent fanbase MercyMe has {{garnered}} after all these years", also stating that [...] "MercyMe still has great <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and their musical progression has been adequate enough, but it's hard to see their sixth record as anything extraordinary and more desirable than their previous material." [...] Billboard reviewer Deborah Evans Price commented that [...] "from the buoyant opener [...] "This Life" [...] to the brief but eloquent closer [...] "This So Called Love," [...] MercyMe's sixth studio album, [...] "The Generous Mr. Lovewell," [...] is a beautifully executed set that celebrates how the power of love can change the world... Music with a message has never sounded lovelier".|$|E
500|$|Having {{given up}} {{his pursuit of}} Skarginska, Bax {{returned}} to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, née Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in Rathgar, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). [...] Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym [...] "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems [...] "like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." [...] Banfield had better <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of the later poems, where Bax [...] "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." [...] Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2014, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Power 106, Busta explained that as he and Eminem kept going [...] "back and forth" [...] in a competitive, battling manner, the song went from three minutes and eight seconds to 6 minutes. Busta continued: [...] "We were like, 'Yo, listen, it's one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> F the rules, but it's another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we're O.D.ing," [...] and called the song a [...] "special," [...] "beautiful piece of art." ...|$|R

500|$|Writing for The Guardian, the {{journalist}} and broadcaster Lesley Riddoch {{took a different}} view, suggesting that the launch of a pro-independence newspaper {{in a country where}} 45% of the population had recently voted for independence [...] "may be a large but calculated risk and a very sound business move", and that [...] "Perhaps the novelty and sheer boldness of the National newspaper will match the national mood". Kirkpatrick, although critical of its online shortfalls, was positive about the paper's content, describing it as [...] "a lively mix of briefs and longer pieces". Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman said The National [...] "has a clear raison d’etre and will be welcomed by a large number of the 1.6 million Scots who voted Yes". Stephen Daisley of STV News wrote that it was [...] "both frustratingly light [...] stodgily worthy", but drew favourable comparisons with the Scottish Standard, a weekly pro-independence paper launched in 2005 that ceased publication after just seven issues, suggesting The National would succeed because it had more financial backing, and as there was a latent demand for a news sheet supporting independence. Writing in The Guardian, {{the journalist}} and author Peter Preston said there were [...] "many good <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the National" [...] including its editor, who was leading a newspaper that [...] "helps to reflect public opinion better".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the track {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who wanted it to show Spears [...] "out in nature". The video was filmed completely on location, {{with none of the}} scenes shot on green screens. The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song whilst standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and inside a cave: despite her [...] "trepidation" [...] and heavy winds which [...] "almost dropped [...] over", she performed the scene without a safety cable. Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie [...] "Crossroads" [...] and Version 3 is the original version." [...] The music video won the award for [...] "International Music Video of the Year Short-Form" [...] on the 2003 Japan Gold Disc Awards.|$|E
500|$|Most of the reviewers had {{positive}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about new character Rory Flanagan's singing voice, including Futterman, who said his was [...] "quite lovely" [...] and had [...] "rich tones", and Rae Votta of Billboard, who {{called him a}} [...] "smooth crooner". Hankinson, however, {{said he had never}} been [...] "floored" [...] by McGinty's voice, [...] "so both of his numbers fell extremely flat to me", and Futterman maintained that both songs were a [...] "weird fit" [...] for the episode, while Votta thought having him perform two solos was [...] "overkill on his character introduction". In general, [...] "Bein' Green" [...] was considered less impressive than [...] "Take Care of Yourself", though it had its supporters: Votta and Bell both referred to it as [...] "a nice introduction", and West declared that his [...] "simple, clear-voiced ode to being an outsider rang true and was hauntingly beautiful", and gave it an [...] "A−". Canning was not impressed: [...] "Perhaps if it had been sung with more feeling, it could have worked better." [...] For [...] "Take Care of Yourself", both West and Goldberg agreed with Rachel's assessment that the performance was [...] "magical", and West graded it with an [...] "A+". The Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter was [...] "blown away", and Chaney gave it an [...] "A" [...] with the comment that Rory [...] "handled it with adorable aplomb". Slezak and VanDerWerff, however, thought the number was somewhat sleep-inducing.|$|E
