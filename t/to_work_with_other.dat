He {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> players, including as a trio with Tal Farlow and Red Mitchell in 1980. For much of the 1980s he led a trio that featured bassist George Mraz and various drummers. By around 1990 Flanagan was concentrating on his own appearances and recordings rather than sideman activities. In the early 1990s Mraz was replaced by Peter Washington, whose heavier bass lines added urgency to the trio's sound.|$|E

The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Government was criticised by the media, {{human rights}} lawyers {{and human rights}} activists for doing too little, too late and for not taking a {{stronger}} stance against the death penalty.

He wanted to revive Confucianism in Yi Province and establish a set of rituals and procedures for the region, so he set up an education office to oversee this project. Apart from building up a library of Confucian texts, Liu Bei also appointed Xu Ci and Hu Qian as academicians (博士) and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> scholars such as Meng Guang and Lai Min on this project.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the name}} Deep Space Soundworks, Atkins and May began to DJ on Detroit’s party circuit. By 1981, Mojo {{was playing the}} record mixes {{recorded}} by the Belleville Three, who were also branching out <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> musicians. The trio traveled to Chicago to investigate the house music scene there, particularly the legendary Chicago DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles. House was a natural progression from disco music, so that the trio began to formulate the synthesis of this dance music with the mechanical sounds of groups like Kraftwerk, {{in a way that}} reflected post-industrialist Detroit. An obsession with the future and its machines is reflected in much of their music, because, according to Atkins, Detroit is the most advanced in the transition away from industrialism.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, {{when the}} British were {{accepting}} peasants from British India as indentured servants {{to work in}} the Caribbean, South Africa and other far away places, Rohillas who had lost their empire were unemployed and restless were sent to places as far as Trinidad, Surinam, Guyana, and Fiji, <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> Indians on the sugarcane fields and perform manual labour. Many of these immigrants stayed there and formed unique communities of their own. Some of them assimilated with the other South Asian Muslim nationalities to form a common Indian Muslim community in tandem with the larger Indian community, losing their distinctive heritage. Their descendants mostly speak English and other local languages. Some Pashtuns travelled to as far away as Australia during the same era.|$|E
25|$|Von Tschirnhaus and Johann Friedrich Böttger were {{employed}} by Augustus II the Strong {{and worked at}} Dresden and Meissen in the German state of Saxony. Tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and {{had been involved in}} the European quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when in 1705 Böttger was appointed to assist him in this task. Böttger had originally been trained as a pharmacist; after he turned to alchemical research, he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold, which attracted the attention of Augustus. Imprisoned by Augustus as an incentive to hasten his research, Böttger was obliged <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> alchemists in the futile search for transmutation and was eventually assigned to assist Tschirnhaus. One of the first results of the collaboration between the two was the development of a red stoneware that resembled that of Yixing.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} {{design of the}} Class 87 was clearly derived {{from that of the}} Class 86; the only major detail differences were two front cab windows on the 87 instead of the three of the 86, and also the lack of headcode indicator boxes; by 1973, visual recognition of train reporting numbers by signallers was no longer necessary. The power and speed of the Class 87 was increased over that of the Class 86. Power output was increased to 5000hp to deal with the more demanding gradients on the northern half of the WCML such as Shap Fell and Beattock Summit, and the top speed was raised to 110mph (180km/h). The 87s were also fitted with multiple working equipment which enabled locomotives <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> members of the class (and some Class 86s) while controlled by one driver.|$|E

50|$|Adroitness {{assesses the}} ability to {{regulate}} your own behavior {{in order to get}} what you want from others.

In that sense it is closely related to conceptions of emotional intelligence.|$|R
