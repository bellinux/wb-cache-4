He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals.

25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was {{thought they would be}} noisy in <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E

For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Life board.|$|E

25|$|In 1637, {{increasing}} {{suspicion of}} {{the intentions of}} Spanish and Portuguese Catholic missionaries in Japan finally led the shogun to seal Japan off from all foreign influence.

An exception was made for the Protestant Dutch, who were allowed to continue to trade with Japan from <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small man-made island in Nagasaki, Deshima. Macau's most profitable trade route, that between Japan and China, had been severed.

25|$|King Tirian of Narnia {{calls on}} Aslan for help, and Jill and Eustace arrive in Narnia. They help Tirian and the {{remaining}} loyal Narnians battle the Calormenes and their allies, but are all forced through the stable door along with several Black Dwarfs. They find themselves not within <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stable, but in a paradise: Aslan's Country. Aslan is there, with King Peter and the other Pevensies (except for Susan, who no longer believes in Narnia) with other characters from previous books, and they watch through the stable door as the world of Narnia is destroyed with the dragons and the salamanders ripping up the trees and Father Time crushing the sun. All {{of the people and}} animals (including those who had previously died) gather outside the barn and are judged by Aslan. The animals who have been loyal to Aslan or the morality upheld by Narnians join Aslan in Aslan's Country. The animals who have opposed or deserted him become ordinary animals and vanish to an unknown place that not even C.S. Lewis knows where they went. The Black Dwarfs (who unlike the Red Dwarfs have lost faith in Aslan) are unable to see Aslan's Country, certain that they are still inside an ordinary stable. When Lucy asks Aslan to help them, he tells her that he will show her what he can and what he cannot do. He then growls at the Black Dwarfs, and makes food magically appear in their hands. This fails to convince them: they think that the growling is a machine and that the food is only what would normally be found in a stable. Aslan tells the children that the Black Dwarfs shut themselves out from him, and therefore cannot be reached, much like Uncle Andrew in The Magician's Nephew.|$|E

The idea of neglecting their fields in the cause of a small band of British isolated in <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fort besieged by a large Mysorean army would have sounded insane.
