5|$|Right {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the march, <b>the</b> <b>volunteers</b> faced many disruptions. When they reached Koviladi, a small village on the banks of Kaveri, they were denied accommodation at a famous inn. However, they found alternative accommodation on the banks of the river, while Rajaji stayed at a private house.

5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> to punt. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E

5000|$|In early January 1918 <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army {{numbered}} approximately 4,000 men {{and fought}} against the Red Army together with units of Gen. Aleksei Kaledin's forces. In late February <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army had to retreat from Rostov-on-Don due to {{the onset of the}} Red Army and left for Kuban in order to unite with the Kuban Cossack formations, a maneuver known as the Ice March. However, most of the Kuban Cossacks did not give their support to <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army. Only a small unit (3,000 men) under the command of Gen. Viktor Pokrovsky joined <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army on March 26, 1918, increasing its number to 6,000 troops. <b>The</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army's attempt to capture Yekaterinodar between April 9-13 was a disaster, with Gen. Kornilov being killed in battle. Gen. Denikin took over command of the remnants of <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army and left for the remote stanitsas beyond the Don region. In June 1918 3,000 men under the command of Col. Mikhail Drozdovsky joined <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army, bringing its strength to between 8,000-9,000 men. On June 23 <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army began its so-called Second Kuban Campaign with support from Gen. Pyotr Krasnov. By September 1918 <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army was up to 30,000-35,000 men thanks to the mobilization of the Kuban Cossacks and [...] "counterrevolutionary elements" [...] gathered in the North Caucasus. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Army took <b>the</b> name of <b>the</b> Caucasus <b>Volunteer</b> Army.|$|R

5|$|Historian George Ostrogorsky {{believed}} that volunteers were gathered through {{the reorganization of}} Anatolia into four themes, where <b>the</b> <b>volunteers</b> were given inalienable grants of land {{on the condition of}} hereditary military service.

5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Tennessee {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty, pushing <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> back toward their goal line. A Tennessee rush was stopped for no gain, then Stewart picked up eight yards on a running play. Needing eight yards for a first down, Manning threw an 11-yard pass to Kent for the first down. On the next play, Manning completed a 43-yard toss to Kent, driving <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> into the Virginia Tech half of the field. Manning's next throw was a 35-yard touchdown throw to Marcus Nash. The extra point was good, and Tennessee took a 140 lead with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced the ball with a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete passes. On fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech knelt on the ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of <b>the</b> <b>volunteering</b> movement in Russia.

After discussing historical and socio-cultural particularities of <b>the</b> <b>volunteering</b> movement in Russia, authors illustrate their points with examples from one specific region, the Republic of Buryatia, to build the argument for the need to investigate challenges and opportunities of <b>the</b> <b>volunteering</b> movement from <b>the</b> social, cultural perspective and offer ideas for future studies...|$|R

5|$|The LHQ Medical Research Unit used human test subjects, all volunteers {{drawn from}} the Australian Army, {{including}} a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. <b>The</b> <b>volunteers</b> were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. <b>The</b> <b>volunteers</b> were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Volunteer</b> Center of North Texas (VCNT) {{was founded}} in 1971 by Annette Strauss, Mitch Jericho, Jan Sanders, and Helen Boothman.

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tennessee 25-yard line, but <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> failed to gain a first down on their second drive of the game, going three-and-out. They punted, returning the ball to Virginia Tech at the Hokies' 31-yard line. Taylor completed a 14-yard pass to Roberts and a 10-yard throw to Marcus Davis for two first downs, advancing the Hokies into Tennessee's half of the field, but Virginia Tech's drive petered out after Williams was tackled for a three-yard loss and the Hokies were unable to regain the lost yardage. Tech punted to the Tennessee 10-yard line, where <b>the</b> <b>Volunteers</b> took over on offense with 1:16 remaining in the quarter. Crompton completed a passing play that lost three yards, then Tennessee regained two of those yards with a running play as time expired in the quarter with Tech leading, 7-0.|$|E

5|$|Word of {{the attack}} at Spafford's farm spread quickly to Fort Defiance, about five miles {{southeast}} of Mineral Point. A small volunteer force of 13 men was assembled at Fort Defiance and they set off to hunt down the band of Native Americans responsible for the massacre. The group reached Fort Hamilton at around midnight on June 15. On the morning of June 15, survivor Bennett Million guided the militia volunteers back {{to the site of}} the massacre. One of <b>the</b> <b>volunteers</b> was Alexander Higgenbotham, a survivor of the St. Vrain massacre. The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated and Spafford's corpse was headless. His head was found scalped and tossed into the grass along the river bank. <b>The</b> <b>volunteers</b> buried the mangled bodies of the fallen and searched in vain for Spencer, whom they also assumed dead.|$|E
5|$|As supervisor, Newsom had as his {{centerpiece}} a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), {{which offered}} care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists {{for the homeless}} in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program.
