5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed {{spoke for}} a liberal {{faction of the}} Whigs in his {{newspaper}} the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley {{as editor of the}} state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far west as Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>As</b> they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E

5|$|The IND Fulton Street Line {{would get}} an eastward extension; it would first be {{extended}} to 106th Street as a four-track line, where it would connect to the IND Rockaway Line. Afterwards, the line would stretch along Linden Boulevard to 229th Street in Eastern Queens. The line {{was to go to}} a two-track terminal at 105th or 106th Streets, with intermediate stops at 75th or 76th Streets and at 84th or 85th Streets (both proposed local stops), as well as at Cross Bay Boulevard (a proposed express stop). In 1951, these relay tracks were still planned <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as 105th Street, with a connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Cross Bay Boulevard. In May 2004, this idea resurfaced, with an attached track map drawn up. If the line were ever built, Pitkin Avenue would have been routed to the east rather than to the southeast at 80th Street, and Linden Boulevard between Conduit and Rockaway Boulevards would have been built to facilitate the line.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend farther along Hillside Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of Hillside, Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. Hillside Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via Hillside Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E

25|$|Spafford {{agreed with}} the coroner that the {{presence}} of passengers were not required for an engine test. After further questioning of the pilot the jury returned a verdict of accidental death in all four cases.

25|$|With {{the support}} of the French government, Henrietta Maria settled in Paris, {{appointing}} as her chancellor, the eccentric Sir Kenelm Digby, and forming a Royalist court in exile at St-Germain-en-Laye. During 1646 there was talk of Prince Charles joining Henrietta Maria in Paris; Henrietta Maria and the King were keen, but the Prince was initially advised not <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>as</b> it would portray him as a Catholic friend of France. After the continued failure of the Royalist efforts in England, he finally agreed to join his mother in July 1646.|$|E

However, as the pass was being delivered to Dyson, Jones, who was at the goal line, glanced over his left shoulder and noticed an open Dyson catching the ball. Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but his legs were wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.|$|E

Churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as Swindon and Cardiff, but blocked their deployment.

25|$|Malaysia's {{national}} petroleum company Petronas owns {{a railway}} line which links its oil refinery complex {{and the nearby}} town of Kerteh, Terengganu, with the petrochemical complex in Gebeng, Kuantan, and Kuantan Port near Kuantan, Pahang.

There have been proposals to extend the line to connect with the KTM line at Mentakab, and there are suggestions <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as Kuala Terengganu and Tumpat.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, Tampa Bay drove into the red zone, and scored a field goal.

25|$|Unlike show hunter classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed {{also is a}} factor, {{especially}} in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). A jumper must jump big, bravely, and fast but also must be careful and accurate to avoid knockdowns and must be balanced and rideable in order to rate and turn accurately. The rider must choose the best line to each fence, saving ground with well-planned turns, and lines and must adjust the horse's stride for each fence and distance. In a jump-off, a rider must balance the need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> fast as possible and turn as tightly as possible against the horse's ability to jump cleanly with good scope.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, now {{armed with}} a medical degree, Schweitzer made a {{definite}} proposal <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at Lambaréné on the Ogooué river, {{in what is now}} Gabon, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising, he was ready to equip a small hospital. In spring 1913, he and his wife set off to establish a hospital (Albert Schweitzer Hospital) near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft) upstream {{from the mouth of the}} Ogooué at Port Gentil (Cape Lopez) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.|$|E
