25|$|An {{alternative}} idea {{to explain}} the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered {{the importance of the}} generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea,</b> however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing – which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history – no matter how cold the external temperature was.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} draft of Freddy vs. Jason, {{it was decided}} that one of the villains needed a redeemable factor. Ronald D. Moore, co-writer of the first draft, {{explained}} that Jason was the easiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the psychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a [...] "blank slate", and felt he was a character the audience could really root for. Another draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore's idea of Jason having a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager named Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, [...] "It gets into <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of there being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and Jason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not deserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster." [...] Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the final draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim. They stated, [...] "We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He's still a brutal killer... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is a hero... They're both villains to be equally feared." [...] Brenna O'Brien, co-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic qualities. She stated, [...] " [...] was a deformed child who almost drowned and then spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his mother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first Friday the 13th, and so now he exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake. Teenage fans can identify with that sense of rejection and isolation, which you can't really get from other killers like Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers." ...|$|E

These trends are contextualised within the dynamics of recession that has triggered new types of creative conversations between parties traditionally considered in opposition and may contribute to reframing urban development as an incremental, organic and collaborative process...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, {{he follows}} a plotline common to many stories {{describing}} {{the birth of}} a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causing the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, [...] "The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [...] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes." [...] He wrote in 1985, [...] "Dune was aimed at <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question." ...|$|E

40|$|As soon as one accepts {{to abandon}} the zero-risk {{paradigm}} of BlackScholes, very interesting issues concerning risk control arise because different definitions of the risk become unequivalent. Optimal hedges then depend on the quantity one wishes to minimize. We show that a definition of the risk {{more sensitive to the}} extreme events generically leads to a decrease both of the probability of extreme losses and of the sensitivity of the hedge on the price of the underlying (the `Gamma'). Therefore, the transaction costs and the impact of hedging on the price dynamics of the underlying are reduced. It is well known that the perfect Black-Scholes hedge only works in the ideal case of a continuous time, log-Brownian evolution of the price of the underlying. Unfortunately, this model is rather remote from reality: the distribution of price changes has `fat tails', which persist even for rather long time lags (see, e. g. [1, 2, 3]). <b>This</b> makes the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of zero-risk strategies and [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{critiques of}} this {{phenomenon}} focus on the partial and sectarian use of the LGBT movement to further ends based in intolerance, ignoring the homophobia and lack of real equality in Western society as a <b>whole.</b> <b>This</b> false <b>idea</b> of equality is usually symbolically represented by the access to equal marriage, heteronormalizing {{the relations between the}} people of the LGBTI community and favouring chauvinistic positions towards the Western country and suspicions towards people coming from those countries that have not legalized any kind of recognition of same-gender couples or that still criminalize homosexuality, often associating those stances with Muslims. Since developing the concept, Puar has more recently argued that the concept should not be used as an accusation or an identity, but is instead a transnational process that represents a historical shift.|$|R

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a novel approach for Face Recognition and Gender classification strategy using the features of lips. Here feature extraction is carried out by using Principal component analysis (PCA) and Gabor wavelet. The proposed algorithm converts the RGB image into the YCbCr color space to detect the skin regions in the facial image. But in order to detect facial features the color image is converted in to gray scale image. This method locates the lip region and the mouth region. The gender classification method classifies almost all the images with different image sizes. The best classification rate is achieved by using the methods given in <b>this</b> work. The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> is offering a simple, reliable and robust method for extracting features of lips for face recognition and gender identification. For recognition experiments we used face images of persons from different sets of the FERET and AR databases. Recognition experiments with the FERET database (containing photographs of persons) showed that our method can achieve maximal 97 - 98 % first one recognition rate and 0. 3 - 0. 4 % Equal Error Rate...|$|R
