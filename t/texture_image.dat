Most {{of the natural}} textures are non-homogenous in terms of color and textural properties. In many cases, {{there is a need}} for a system that is able to divide the non-homogenous <b>texture</b> <b>images</b> into visually similar clusters. In this paper, we introduce a new method for this purpose. In our clustering technique, the <b>texture</b> <b>images</b> are ordered into a queue based on their visual similarity. Based on this queue, similar <b>texture</b> <b>images</b> can be selected. In similarity evaluation, we use feature distributions that are based on the color and texture properties of the sample images. Color correlogram is a distribution that has proved to be effective in characterization of color and texture properties of the non-homogenous <b>texture</b> <b>images.</b> Correlogram is based on the co-occurrence matrix, which is a statistical tool in texture analysis. In this work, we use gray level and hue correlograms in the characterization of the colored texture. The similarity between the distributions is measured using several different distance measures.
