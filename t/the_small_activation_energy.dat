Using ab initio quantum-chemistry techniques including electron correlation they model the abstraction of hydrogen from dihydrogen, methane, acetylene, benzene and isobutane by the acetylene radical. By conservative estimates, the abstraction barrier is small (less than 7. 7 kcal mol^- 1) in all cases except for acetylene and zero in the case of isobutane.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Multilayered {{epitaxial}} nanofibers are exemplary model {{systems for}} the study of exciton dynamics and lasing in organic materials because of their well-defined morphology, high luminescence efficiencies, and color tunability. We use temperature-dependent continuous wave and picosecond photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to quantify exciton diffusion and resonance-energy transfer (RET) processes in multilayered nanofibers consisting of alternating layers of para-hexaphenyl (p 6 P) and α-sexithiophene (6 T) serving as exciton donor and acceptor material, respectively. The high probability for RET processes is confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The activation energy for exciton diffusion in p 6 P is determined to be as low as 19 meV, proving p 6 P epitaxial layers also as a very suitable donor material system. <b>The</b> <b>small</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for exciton diffusion of the p 6 P donor material, the inferred high p 6 P-to- 6 T resonance-energy-transfer efficiency, and the observed weak PL temperature dependence of the 6 T acceptor material together result in an exceptionally high optical emission performance of this all-organic material system, thus making it well suited, for example, for organic light-emitting devices...|$|E

From density functional theory, we show on several transition metal surfaces (Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd and Pt) that water prefers to chemisorb as a H-bonded dimer, one molecule being chemisorbed by the O atom, but the second one developing only a weak interaction with the surface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to gain a {{fundamental}} understanding of the carbonation-induced alterations in borehole grouts. This was approached by determining {{the relationship between the}} chemical denaturation of the minerals in the evolving pore network and its associated transport properties. These changes resulted from material processing under a range of simulated underground temperatures, pressures and pH. The pore network geometry and transport properties were examined {{as a function of the}} degree of structural and mineral alteration. These alterations were then macroscopically related to the depth evolution of the carbonation fronts under elevated temperature and pressure conditions. The microstructure, pore geometry and transport properties were studied experimentally for class G cementitious grout samples immersed in CO 2 saturated brine at 60 ºC and 120 ºC (80 bar) for durations up to 5 months. The evolution of the carbonation depth was captured by means of X-ray computed tomography (XRCT), the compositional changes were detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and finally the pore geometry was revealed using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and N 2 -physisorption. Temperature was the most sensitive variable to control the rate of alteration for both microstructure and pore network. Calcium leaching in the samples treated with N 2 -saturated brine was found to be a thermally dependent process; in fact the activation energy for Ca transport was found to be higher when increasing temperature from 60 ºC to 120 ºC. At temperatures higher than 60 ºC full conversion of portlandite to other forms was justified on the grounds of activation energy and appeared to cause chemical instabilities within the grouts. Those instabilities where aggravated in the case of the carbonated brine. The examined carbonated samples showed two clearly defined areas (inner core and carbonated region) for any duration, that were separated by a clear demarcation line, namely the carbonation front. The time evolution of the carbonation depth was found to follow a power law equation that reflected the rate of diffusion for each temperature. At 60 ºC the higher rate of diffusion led to faster local supersaturation conditions in the pores (with respect to Ca 2 + and〖 HCO〗_ 3 ^-) justifying the growth of aragonite crystals. At 120 ºC, the slower rate of diffusion was reflected by the growth of calcite. At 60 ºC and 120 ºC, both inner and carbonated parts exhibited a sealing stage (up to 1 month) and a dissolution stage (up to 5 and 3 months). The terms ‘sealing’ and ‘dissolution’ referred only for changes in the apparent porosity but in reality these changes were found to reflect the changes of the critical cavity to throat ratio due to different temperature and time. At 60 ºC the permeability was proved to be controlled by the critical throats (big values of cavity/ throat ratio) and at 120 ºC by the size of the critical cavity (small cavity/ throat ratio). The critical size of the pores and throats at 120 ºC close to 12 nm, supported the unrestricted diffusion of calcium towards the outer and hence the faster buffering of the effluent bicarbonates. At 120 ºC, the buffering was found to take place at the surface sites of the C-S-H particles and thus from structural Ca 2 +. At 60 ºC the restricted transport of species due to the small critical throats (4 nm) resulted in the big cavities which were the loci of aragonite crystallization from the free Ca 2 +. This distinction of ‘diffusion’ at 120 ºC and ‘restricted transport’ at 60 ºC, was the key point for the better fitting of the time evolution of the carbonation front to the x_C=A∙t^(1 / 2) at 120 ºC. At the inner parts of the CO 2 treated samples at 120 ºC, in order the throats and cavities to resemble in size, the silicate matrix was suggested to experience simultaneously localized expansion (decreasing the cavity size) and shrinkage (throat enlargement). At 60 ºC the preservation of the threshold diameter, the intensified ink-bottle phenomenon and same critical throats close to 3 nm, could have been caused due to: (1) the retarded pozzolanic reactions at 60 ºC that would have caused the throats to be mechanically stable due to the microsilica particles and, (2) <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for the C-S-H particles to re-organize their structures and to align them leading to silicate condensation and polymerization. The plethora of existing oilwells sealed with ordinary Portland cements globally, dictates that the permeability of the entire well to CO 2 fluids will rely on the diffusion among the pores of the C-S-H structures. The permeability values from this study (ranging from 70 μD to 0. 1 μD) were found to allow for the efficient geological storage for CO 2 across the entire range of temperatures studied but with different mechanisms of diffusion. The major significance of the present thesis was that it provided a better understanding of the relationship between the cement microstructure with its pore network parameters, a relationship that ultimately determined the permeability and extent of carbonation in the long term. In other words the aim of the thesis was fulfilled giving a more comprehensive image during carbonation of a class G oil well cement grout in a realistic scenario of geological storage of CO 2, with temperature and time to be the only variables. The implications of the studied temperatures (60 ºC and 120 ºC) and durations (1, 3 and 5 months) in real CO 2 injection wells, could provide better assessment of legacy injection wells (containing aged cement grouts) and more efficient design of new CO 2 injection wells...|$|E

The {{effect of}} alumina {{precursors}} on microstructure, sintering and creep behavior of sol-gel derived mullite ceramics was studied by scanning and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (SEM, TEM and HRTEM), dilatometry and measuring the creep resistance in 4 -point bending mode. When aluminum nitrate nonahydrate {{was used as a}} precursor, elongated crystals (with longer axis about 5 - 7 µm) were embedded into a matrix of polyhedral much smaller grains. This morphology was due to overlapping of mullite crystallization and viscous flow sintering. Equiaxial mullite grains with 1. 3 µm mean sizes were obtained using boehmite (γ-AlOOH) as alumina precursor. Transient alumina formed in situ by the decomposition of boehmite shifted the mullite formation above the sintering temperature, and allowed the formation of equiaxial mullite grains.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates {{the formation of}} multiphase compound with magnesium silicate fluoride and cordierite as major phases. Dielectric studies of the compound shows a strong frequency dispersion of permittivity in the low frequency region followed by a nearly frequency-independent behavior in the high frequency region. The presence of alkali ions (K+) in MAS glass-ceramic results in higher dielectric constant and higher losses. Dielectric loss (tanδ) seems to be reduced at higher frequencies after reaching the instrumental saturation at 1 kHz.

The shrinking central cores of Zr(Fe,Cr) {sub 2 } precipitates in Zircaloy- 4 remain crystalline, while in Zircaloy- 2 these precipitates quickly undergo partial transformation and the low-Fe amorphous front advances into a random mixture of amorphous and crystalline regions, each with the original composition.

The dose-response curves were studied. Shoulders at the lower exposure regions were observed in the log-survival curves for incubation temperatures 31 - 37 o C.
