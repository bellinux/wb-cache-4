5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

25|$|Vincenzo Camporini {{believes}} {{that in the}} future the Ministry of Defence needs to rewrite their military doctrines, taking into account the redistribution of responsibility imposed by the new technology and conversely <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the greatest care in nurturing the maturity and the cultural level of the troops, throughout the education that is provided. he has stated that he wonders whether the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is not in the position to take any initiative in the field of education of military personnel, or to make everybody aware of the specifics related to the operations peculiar to its mission.|$|E

25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but {{no one wants to}} return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

2500|$|In a June {{interview}} with GameSpot, Traveller's Tales revealed the game {{had been in}} development for over three years, with them funding the project themselves, long before Midway got involved. They explained the game utilises a game engine specifically designed for Haven, which allows smooth transition from third-person gameplay to piloting a vehicle. The engine also powers the cutscenes, allowing the camera to move and sweep around the landscape of a level, giving the player {{an idea of the}} route <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> Landscapes are fractally generated using the PlayStation 2's vector processors, which allows for considerable draw distance. The game also features night and day cycles and alternating weather patterns, such as randomly occurring rain showers (which prompt Haven to pull his hood up when outdoors). The developers were also keen to stress the game features no loading times; [...] "Traveller's Tales intends for the game's loading to be invisible to players after the initial startup, thanks to carefully managed memory usage and constant streaming." [...] They also revealed that after the PlayStation 2 launch, the game would be released for the Game Boy Advance as well as GameCube and Xbox.|$|E
2500|$|In the Present Day, Regina informs Mary Margaret that Emma {{has slipped}} out {{information}} about Merlin, then confirms {{that she has}} the Crimson Crown {{which can be used}} to summon Merlin, {{but it has to be}} the one that was chosen by the sorcerer. When Belle suggests Gold, believing that he is no worse that Emma, everyone else turns a deaf ear saying its a risk <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> if Gold gets hurt, and a furious Belle storms out. Out in the woods, Gold stares at the chipped tea cup in his hands and says [...] "Forgive Me, Belle," [...] then kisses it and breaks the glass in order to take the shards to free himself from the ropes. When Emma arrives to the spot to see if Gold has made any progress, they discovered Gold has escaped. Emma then forces Merida to find him, and threatens the archer by destroying her heart by having Merida kill Belle in order to turn Gold into the hero she needs to release Excalibur. As for Belle, she uses a street map to find out where Emma is keeping Gold, then hears a noise from the elevator, prompting her to take a weapon. She opens it and it's Gold, who warns Belle that Merida's after her by using Gold to turn him into a hero but in order to do that Emma has made Belle a target, and the two race back to the pawn shop to find magic.|$|E

2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of Emma.|$|E

6000|$|No {{point of}} duty {{has been more}} miserably warped and perverted by false priests, in all churches, than this duty of the young to choose whom they will serve.

60|$|These amateur Life Insurance {{agents are}} a curious band. The {{world is full}} of them.
