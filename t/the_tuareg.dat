5|$|The desert nomads {{were also}} traders. The Sahara {{is a very}} large expanse of land {{stretching}} from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. Trade routes were developed linking the Sahel in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. <b>The</b> <b>Tuareg</b> were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards. Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells. Several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the Sahara between the 8th and 18th centuries. Traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles, shipping and air freight, but caravans still travel along routes between Agadez and Bilma and between Timbuktu and Taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge communities.|$|E

50|$|According to Rasmussen, Tuareg society {{exhibits}} {{a blend of}} pre-Islamic and Islamic practices. As such, patrilineal Muslim values {{are believed to have}} been superimposed upon <b>the</b> <b>Tuareg's</b> traditional matrilineal society. Other, apparently newer customs include the practice of close-cousin endogamous marriages and polygyny in conformity with Islamic tenets. Polygyny, which has been witnessed among Tuareg chiefs and Islamic scholars, is in turn thought to be contrary to the pre-Islamic monogamous tradition of <b>the</b> nomadic <b>Tuareg.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Nigerien Armed Forces were {{involved}} from 2007 to 2009 in an insurgency {{in the north}} of the country, labeled <b>the</b> Second <b>Tuareg</b> Rebellion. A previously unknown group, the Mouvement des Nigeriens pour la Justice (MNJ), emerged in February 2007. <b>The</b> predominantly <b>Tuareg</b> group has issued a number of demands, mainly related to development in the north. It has attacked military and other facilities and laid landmines in the north. The resulting insecurity has devastated Niger's tourist industry and deterred investment in mining and oil. The government has labeled the MNJ criminals and traffickers, and refuses to negotiate with the group until it disarms. As of July 2008, some 100 to 160 Nigerien troops {{have been killed in the}} ongoing conflict. <b>The</b> second <b>tuareg</b> rebellion ended in 2009 with Peace Talks hosted by Libya.|$|R
