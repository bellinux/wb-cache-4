5|$|Since {{the late}} 1920s {{the tension between}} the air and naval {{services}} had declined. It arose briefly again in 1937 when the question of the FAA operational control arose. On this occasion the British Government sided with the Admiralty. Despite a spirited defence of its asset, once the Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip had decided to transfer the arm, the Air Ministry was content to let the matter rest. Any threat to the Air Ministry's existence had long since passed; budgetary constraint, and the reluctance to engage in another battle which would waste resources were also factors in the Air Ministry's decision not to contest the issue further. However, inter-service squabbling assured maritime aviation's stagnation, especially in shore-based elements. Virtually no co-operation existed in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and development. In the case of Coastal Command, it continued to come third in the Air Ministry's list of priorities, after Fighter and Bomber Commands, well into the late 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|The academicians {{insisted on}} a {{perspective}} that looked beyond particular localities to a larger national and international perspective, and that in practice {{it should be done}} along modern and scientific lines. [...] To that end, the association actively promoted excellence in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> the association published a series of annual reports through the Smithsonian Institution and adopted the American Historical Review in 1898 to provide early outlets for this new brand of professional scholarship.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board compression tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field.|$|E
