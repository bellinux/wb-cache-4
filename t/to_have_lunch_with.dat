5|$|One day, Neto {{travels with}} his friend Lobo to Santos without informing his parents. They go to an {{apartment}} where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents {{to send him to}} a mental institution.|$|E

Shafer). Their meal initially goes well, but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives. Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals {{that he is the}} father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

Hynes watched Pucci's 2005 film Thumbsucker and thought that [...] "We'd be so lucky to have him." [...] He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway {{in less than a}} week to attend a friend's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving. Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> him. Hynes said of the meeting, [...] "I think we really [...] each other," [...] and Pucci accepted the role a week later. Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she [...] "loved the script" [...] and was keen to play [...] "a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [...] sexual manipulation"; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind, having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al. Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel, Maura Tierney, and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they [...] "read [...] and really liked it". He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types. He described Deschanel as a [...] "glamour girl" [...] and Malone as a sexually mature woman.|$|E
500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E

Myra is now {{bedridden}} and Oswald works full-time; their upstairs neighbours are atrociously noisy, regardless of Myra's illness. Nellie takes to visiting her at tea-time; she also takes her out by the sea. Myra expresses her regrets over her husband. (If she had not married him, her great-uncle would have bequeathed her his fortune. Instead, she eloped and he gave it away to the church.) Oswald takes <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> a young woman. Once, Nellie asks her why she is so harsh on her husband, and Myra dismisses her. Shortly after, her condition gets worse.

The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby O. According to Tennant: [...] "I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> Bobby O."

Directly I mentioned his name, it was as though I had thrown a bomb shell into the place. The clerk called me on one side, took me into a private office, and showed me a newspaper.

Several mainstream actors were cast, Guccione intending {{to make a}} film which he felt, like Citizen Kane, would be a landmark in cinematic history. Guccione offered directing duties to John Huston and Lina Wertmüller, both of whom rejected the film. After viewing scenes from the film Salon Kitty, Guccione agreed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> that film's director Tinto Brass, believing Brass would be the ideal person to direct Caligula. Brass had a reputation for being difficult to deal with on film sets but Guccione thought the film's epic scope would [...] "keep [...] in line" [...] and that Brass understood the concept of the film enough to direct it. Brass described Vidal's screenplay as [...] "the work of an aging arteriosclerotic" [...] and agreed to direct only if he was allowed to rewrite Vidal's screenplay. Brass' screenplay expanded the sexual content to include orgies, decorative phalluses, and much female nudity. Guccione said Brass' rewrites were done out of necessity to the film's visual narrative and did not alter the dialogue or content.|$|E

The {{middle of the day}} was spent in strolling or sitting in the shade. A watchful deferential gallantry trembling on the verge of tenderness, was the note of their intercourse on his side--with a playful turn of the phrase concealing the profound trouble of his whole being caused by her inaccessible nearness. Late in the afternoon General D'Hubert walked home between the fields of vines, sometimes intensely miserable, sometimes supremely happy, sometimes pensively sad, but always feeling a special intensity of existence: that elation common to artists, poets, and lovers, to men haunted by a great passion, by a noble thought or a new vision of plastic beauty.|$|E

In the summer of 2005, I, then an undergrad of Peking University inspired by David’s beautiful work on the CO 2 avoidance behavior of the fruit fly, took an overnight train just to catch David’s talk in Shanghai, a city that is a thousand miles away.

David is exactly the type of scientist and colleague that I had been looking for, and the best advisor I could dream of.

I have known another one come <b>to</b> Harvard, <b>have</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> President Lowell, and do an entire book on the Decline of Serious Study in America. Or take the case of my own university. I remember Mr. Rudyard Kipling coming to McGill and saying in his address to the undergraduates at 2.30 P.M., [...] "You have here a great institution." [...] But how could he have gathered this information? As far as I know he spent the entire morning with Sir Andrew Macphail in his house beside the campus, smoking cigarettes. When I add that he distinctly refused to visit the Palaeontologic Museum, that he saw nothing of our new hydraulic apparatus, or of our classes in Domestic Science, his judgment that we had here a great institution seems a little bit superficial. I can only put beside it, to redeem it in some measure, the hasty and ill-formed judgment expressed by Lord Milner, [...] "McGill is a noble university": and the rash and indiscreet expression of the Prince of Wales, when we gave him an LL.D. degree, [...] "McGill has a glorious future." ...|$|R
