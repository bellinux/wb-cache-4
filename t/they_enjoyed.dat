5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E
5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. <b>They</b> <b>enjoyed</b> how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial made it easy to learn.|$|E

5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys {{for the freedom}} and {{privileges}} <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> and felt that girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women {{should have the right}} to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|That summer, both couples {{moved into}} nearby summer homes. In November, they {{returned}} to Pisa and met Lord Byron, who had recently arrived there himself. The two couples later shared {{a house in a}} remote location near Lerici, where they were visited in early 1822 by Edward John Trelawny. Though <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> each other's company, the house was small and the arrangements led to numerous conflicts between the servants of each family.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the children would benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed.</b> They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. <b>They</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E

5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, although <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson {{left his}} long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Both Niedermayer and von Hentig {{returned}} to Germany, where <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> celebrated careers. On von Hentig's recommendation, Niedermayer was knighted and bestowed with the Military Order of Max Joseph. He {{was asked to}} lead a third expedition to Afghanistan in 1917, but declined. Niedermayer served in the Reichswehr before retiring in 1933 and joining the University of Berlin. He was recalled to active duty during World War II, serving in Ukraine. He was taken prisoner {{at the end of}} the war and died in a Soviet prisoner of war camp in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself had lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E

5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} {{that he could have}} played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman. During his off-season, when he lives in New York City, he has trained with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, and once tried to arrange a pick-up game in the city's Central Park with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.|$|E
5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new and enjoyable game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy. Nintendo Power said <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> Block Ball and its number of stages, but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative. All six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{was granted}} {{a room in the}} palace to use for fortune telling, which the king made sure was stocked with alcohol, as <b>they</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{drinking}} together. In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired by the head of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard at the Customs Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E
