It {{became clear that}} the mechanistic concept of life, which dominated our study of medicine at the time, was unsatisfactory... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> the principle of creative power governing life; only it was not satisfactory {{as long as it was}} not tangible, as long as it could not be described or practically handled. For, rightly, this was considered the supreme goal of natural science.|$|E

2500|$|... "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like {{a city in}} {{a rather}} gloomy Victorian novel... We had now arrived {{in the heart of}} the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone {{emphasised}} that fact.

2500|$|Lesley Hazleton {{describes}} the dispute between Fatimah and Abu Bakr as follows: « {{sent a message}} to Abu Bakr asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. Muhammad's estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of Muhammad was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.» ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{nickname}} [...] "Pipette" [...] was {{a reference}} to his smoking habits, which at several stages saw him smoking on the field. Quite famously {{in a game against}} Wigan (which was played in a snowstorm), he actually caught the ball with one hand while holding a cigarette in the other hand. While he often had unusual habits for a sportsman, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> his talent, he was a master at kicking in play and in overall attack he was both unorthodox and unpredictable. Aside from his playing skill, he developed a reputation based on his somewhat eccentric attitude or charismatic manner. He was known to not tackle a player if he believed it would demonstrate the fault of his team-mates for not previously making the tackle, a cause of some controversy during his career.|$|E

60|$|Subconscious Self {{may have}} had an {{undesirable}} way of expressing itself, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> {{the truth of what}} it said. Its words carried conviction.
