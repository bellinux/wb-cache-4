5|$|In 2007, {{businessman}} Mike Ashley {{purchased the}} combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41% {{share in the}} club, through a holding company St James Holdings, {{with a view to}} buy the rest. Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to sell <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Fortinet had {{an initial}} public offering. It was {{planning}} to raise $52.4 million through the sale of 5.8 million shares. Many stockholders also sold <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> simultaneously. Just before {{the first day of}} trading, Fortinet increased the share price from $9 to $12.50 and the price increased in the market to $16.62 {{by the end of the}} first day of trading, raising $156 million in financing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International {{had both}} sold <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James Hardie Industries to {{maintain}} an Australian majority ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend {{at the time to}} privatise government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5billion over 25years was awarded to ASC.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the trend in}} the importance of small producers in the Canadian and U. S. manufacturing sectors from the early 1970 s to the late 1990 s in order to investigate whether there was a common North American trend in changes in plant size. It finds that small plants in both countries increased <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of employment up to the 1990 s, but <b>their</b> <b>share</b> remained stable in the 1990 s. Small plants increased <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output up to the 1990 s, but then saw <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output decline. Over the entire time period, <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output increased less than <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of employment and, therefore, their relative labour productivity has fallen. The similarity in the trends in the two countries suggests that causes of this phenomenon should be sought in similarities such as the technological environment rather than in country-specific factors like unionization or trade intensities.

5000|$|The envy-freeness {{concept was}} {{introduced}} to the problem of fair cake-cutting by George Gamow and Marvin Stern in 1958. [...] In the context of fair cake-cutting, envy-freeness means that each partner believes that <b>their</b> <b>share</b> is at least as large as any other share. In the context of chore division, envy-freeness means that each partner believes <b>their</b> <b>share</b> is at least as small as any other share. The crucial issue is that no partner would wish to swap <b>their</b> <b>share</b> with any other partner.|$|R
5|$|Four {{companies}} bid for {{the initial}} public service obligation to operate the line: Fjord1 Partner, Norges Statsbaner, Tide Bane and Veolia Transport Norge. On 3 April 2009, the public transport agency Skyss announced that Fjord1 Partner, {{a joint venture between}} Fjord1 AS and Keolis, had won the tender competition. Fjord1 Partner received 324 applications for their 26 jobs as drivers and 10 jobs as traffic controllers. In 2014 Fjord1 AS sold <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> in Fjord1 Partner to Keolis, and the company changed its name to Keolis Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lyn was in deep {{financial}} difficulties {{after having been}} promoted to the Elite League after the 1991 season. To create additional liquidity, the club sold its 44% share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOK4.4 million in January 1993. At the same time, NFF bought the 5.1% stake owned by the other clubs, making NFF the sole owner of the stadium. In October, the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded {{to take over the}} elite football teams in Lyn. At the same time, the club announced that it planned to purchase back <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> in Ullevaal Stadion, by letting the club take up a loan.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Autolink {{canceled}} {{their contract}} with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink {{announced that they}} would establish their own railway company, {{which they had been}} working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because Rail Management would not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to Autolink. From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions.|$|E

Two weeks later, Autolink {{announced that they}} would establish their own railway company, {{which they had been}} working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because the majority owner—Rail Management, in turn owned by Mons Bolin—would not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to Autolink. From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions.|$|E
5|$|While the {{air cargo}} {{industry}} in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% {{in the fiscal}} year 2003–04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{municipal}} council was considering {{the future of}} the airport. The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b> In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E

5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of <b>their</b> <b>shares,</b> and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E
5|$|Money No Enough was {{produced}} by JSP Films on a budget of S$850,000. The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director, J.P. Tan as producer, Kamis as cinematographer, A. Supranamian as film editor, Anthony Ng as art director and Abdul Shukar Mohd as sound designer. Filming was plagued by financial problems, such as poor quality shooting equipment. After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough, distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008. The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and Producer over <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> of the profits. To mark its tenth anniversary, Money No Enough was released in cinemas again and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Money No Enough 2.|$|E
5|$|When Unearthed Arcana was {{released}} in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, Artifact of Evil. The financial crisis had been averted, but ironically Gygax had {{paved the way for}} his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to Williams, but he lost.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily Mail in Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|The Abir Company entered {{liquidation}} in 1898 as a {{means of}} tax avoidance and to escape Belgian business regulations. It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b> The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram export tax. All initial capital investments had been amortised by 1899 along with material expenses in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it had been around 2 fr per share.|$|E
5|$|The provincial forces began {{landing at}} Gabarus Bay on 30 April, and laid siege to the {{fortress}} while the British ships blockaded the harbour. The Americans began suffering battle losses, while the British naval officers, {{who had a}} low opinion of American soldiers, grew increasingly critical of the American efforts. Warren tried to exert control over the provincial troops, but Pepperrell resisted him. Louisbourg surrendered on 17 June. The Americans lost 180 men in combat, to disease or at sea during the siege, while the Royal Navy ships did not fire on the fortress, and lost just one sailor. As the victors settled into occupation of Louisbourg, friction grew between the Americans and the British. The terms of surrender guaranteed the French in all of their possessions; there was no plunder for the American troops. On the other hand, the Royal Navy had captured several rich French prizes, and British sailors on shore leave bragged to the Americans about how rich {{they were going to}} be from <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E
