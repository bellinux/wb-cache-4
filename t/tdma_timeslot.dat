5000|$|In TDMA, each user's {{timeslot}} {{ends with}} a guard period, to avoid data loss and to reduce interference to the following user, caused by propagation delay. Thus a user's timeslot is protected from interference from the preceding user, by the guard interval (guard period) {{at the end of}} that preceding user's timeslot. It is a common misconception that each <b>TDMA</b> <b>timeslot</b> begins with a guard interval, however the ITU Technical Specifications (such as GSM 05.05) clearly define the guard period as being at the end of each timeslot, thus providing protection against data loss within that timeslot, and protection against interference to the following timeslot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a distributed algorithm for efficient Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slot allocation in Wireless Sensor Networks, {{which is to}} be used in close association with a new TDMA-based MAC protocol called Latency-Energy Minimization Medium Access (LEMMA). Unlike most of the existent proposals, which try to guarantee interference-free allocation based on the n-hop criterion (which can only work with regular topologies), the presented algorithm bases its decisions on the received signal strength, allowing it to operate independently of the WSN topology. The performance of the proposed slot allocation algorithm was compared with centralized depth-first slot allocation using computer simulation. The results show that the proposed scheme is significantly faster, only paying the price of extra energy consumption during the initial network setup phase.

40|$|Abstract of WO 2009044368 Disclosed are wakeable {{wireless}} communications devices, and methods for waking {{wireless communications}} devices, {{for use in}} a wireless network of such devices. The devices communicate during respectively-designated timeslots according to a communications protocol. The wireless devices include a wireless transceiver that communicates over the wireless network during device-designated timeslots, and that is operative in a reduced power mode during other timeslots. The wireless devices further include a wakeable wakeup detection circuit (106), synchronous with the device- designated <b>TDMA</b> <b>timeslots</b> to transition out of a reduced power mode, to detect valid signals during {{at least one of the}} device-designated <b>TDMA</b> <b>timeslots</b> and, in response thereto, to prompt (108) the wireless transceiver to transition out of its reduced power mode and communicate over the wireless network...|$|R
50|$|A TRX transmits and {{receives}} {{according to the}} GSM standards, which specify eight <b>TDMA</b> <b>timeslots</b> per radio frequency. A TRX may lose some of this capacity as some information is required to be broadcast to handsets {{in the area that}} the BTS serves. This information allows the handsets to identify the network and gain access to it. This signalling makes use of a channel known as the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH).|$|R
30|$|Collision free MAC {{protocols}} exploiting a TDMA fashion {{have been}} studied to solve collision problems in WLANs [19 – 25]. In these protocol, there are periods to transmit frames in a TDMA fashion, where APs and STAs can transmit frames without collision. Allocating <b>TDMA</b> <b>timeslots</b> to RoF APs {{taking into account the}} large delay could avoid delay induced collisions. However, these approaches require major modifications to a MAC protocol of the STAs, which means that conventional devices can not be used in the WLANs using the protocol exploiting a TDMA fashion. Our protocol focuses on RoF-based WLAN with backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11 standard, where existing WLAN devices are available. Therefore, these approaches exploiting TDMA are not suitable for our target application.|$|R
