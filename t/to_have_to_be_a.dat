50|$|The mode {{of action}} for {{ambazone}} has been studied extensively and {{has been shown to}} react via different methods. Ambazone shows low mutagenic activity and no cardiovascular, CNS, metabolic, or gastrointestinal side-effects with I.V. doses up to 10-5 mol/kg and oral doses up to 10-3 mol/kg. Ambazone can be administered via oral or I.V. administration, but the problem with oral administration is that one experimental study shows there is only a 35-50% absorption while another study shows 40% in the intestines; These results would tend to lead the reader to think that ambazone would not be the best choice for treatment, because with such a low absorbance, there is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> greater concentration ingested to gain a positive effect from the drug. The problem with a greater concentration is that ambazone has a half-life of 6-7 hours. It was stated above that ambazone possess no CNS side-effects due to the fact, that it will not cross the blood brain barrier. Although this is the body’s way of protecting unwanted substances from attacking the brain, this also limits the treatment of brain tumors with ambazone.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} made when Frank Ifield {{was at the}} height of his {{popularity}} with an attempt to reproduce the success of Cliff Richard's musicals. Ifield's agent, Leslie Grade, suggested another one of his clients, Christopher Miles as director. Miles was only 25 and had never made a feature film before. He says the script was to be written by the people who did Cliff Richard's musicals. Miles:Unfortunately the two writers of the Cliff pictures were not then on speaking terms, so the two halves of a rather soggy script arrived separately in the post, and not surprisingly made no sense at all. So Leslie, not one to be beaten, got an old writer friend from ITV, Lewis Greifer, saying [...] "He's the man, I know you'll get on well" [...] which we did. However thinking up a credible vehicle for Frank, amiable and charming as he was, proved to me that ultimately you cannot make a celluloid purse out of a sow's ear, even though Frank was gamely willing to send himself up. It was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> small budget, and to save money I was asked to use a new film saving invention - the dreaded 'Techniscope' process. By only using two sprocket holes for each frame (instead of the standard four) a narrow negative was created, which had a sort of wide-screen look. However in 1965 colour film stock was still rather grainy, which showed when the final picture was blown up for the large cinema screen. Miles says the leading lady fell pregnant before shooting started so he replaced her with Suzy Kendall (making her film debut).|$|E

40|$|Residential {{heat pump}} water heaters (HPWHs) have {{recently}} reemerged on the U. S. market. These units {{have the potential}} to provide homeowners significant cost and energy savings. However, actual in use performance of a HPWH will vary significantly with climate, installation location, HVAC equipment, and hot water use. To determine what actual in use energy consumption of a HPWH may be in different regions of the U. S., annual simulations of both 50 and 80 gallon HPWHs as well as a standard electric water heater were performed for over 900 locations across the U. S. The simulations included a benchmark home to take into account interactions between the space conditioning equipment and the HPWH and a realistic hot water draw profile. It was found that the HPWH will always save some source energy when compared to a standard electric resistance water heater, although savings varies widely with location. In addition to looking at source energy savings, the breakeven cost (the net installed cost a HPWH would have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cost neutral replacement for a standard water heater) was also examined. The highest breakeven costs were seen in cases with high energy savings, such as the southeastern U. S., or high energy costs, such as New England and California. While the breakeven cost is higher for 80 gallon units than 50 gallon units, the higher net installed costs of an 80 gallon unit lead to the 50 gallon HPWHs being more likely to be cost effective...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline a three-stage process for {{engaging}} with students to develop school level indicators of health; in sequential class groups students first generated, then categorised indicators and finally developed schematic representations of their analyses. There is a political and practical need to develop appropriate indicators for health-promoting schools. As key stakeholders in education, students have the right to be fully engaged in this process. Design/methodology/approach - The sample in this paper comprised 164 students aged 16 - 17 years in three medium-sized Dublin schools. In the first classroom, students answered the question "If you moved to a new school, what would it need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> healthy place?" on individual flashcards. In the second classroom students classified the flashcards into groups using a variation of the card game "snap". In the third classroom, students discussed the relationships between the developed categories and determined how the categories should be presented. These procedures were repeated twice in three schools, resulting in six developed schemata. Findings - The paper finds that the six sets of categories showed remarkable similarity - physical aspects of the school predominated but emotional and social health issues also emerged as potential indicators. The schema demonstrated the holistic perspectives of students. They illustrate the importance of relationships and the physical and psycho-social environment within schools. Originality/value - The paper illustrates that students can productively engage in the process of indicator development and have the potential to act as full stakeholders in health-promoting schools. The methods enabled student control over the data generation, analysis and presentation phases of the research, and provided a positive, fun experience for both students and researchers...|$|E
40|$|The 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard, IEEE 802. 3 ae, {{was adopted}} in 2002 and {{represented}} a ten-fold increase in performance {{over the previous}} 1 Gigabit standard IEEE 802. 3 z. The standard itself covers only {{the details of the}} individual point-to-point links and does not address any system issues of how Ethernet switches may be built or deployed. Designing a switched system involves choosing an appropriate architecture, selecting the best available silicon technology and determining suitable electronic packaging. The EU funded ESTA project was established to perform the basic research and development that would define the specifications for building an Ethernet switch to meet 10 Gbps switching requirements. The part of the project carried out at CERN, within which this thesis work was done, involved the development, construction and validation of the backplane support for this 10 Gbps Ethernet switch. In addition the program required that there be developed an understanding of where the limits of performance lay in terms of materials, manufacture and packaging technologies. The most performant switches are built in a modular form consisting of a chassis and a number of plug-in modules. These modules plug into a common backplane which provides power, control, management and data interconnects. The functionality of such a system depends critically on the underlying interconnect even for such relatively low speed applications such as VME or Gigabit Ethernet. The backplane constitutes one of the weakest links of switching systems because it is subject to bandwidth limitations due to a limited number of connections and is also the source of signal degradation in the forms of amplitude and frequency loss, crosstalk, noise and reflections. To meet the project requirements it would be necessary to systematically identify and quantify each aspect of the design process. This had to be done in terms of the effects on the system and its performance at 10 Gbps as well for higher speeds. In addition to the theoretical study there was also going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> practical method developed that would show that the required performance was not only met but exceeded. This was necessary to validate to what extend the theory converged with practice and also to ensure that the final constructed backplane was free from any possible system errors when running under maximum design conditions...|$|E
40|$|Advances in the {{fabrication}} technology {{have been a}} major driving force in the unprecedented increase in computing capabilities over the last several decades. Despite huge reductions in the switching energy of the transistors, two major issues have emerged with decreasing fabrication technology scales. They are: 1) increased impact of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation on transistor performance, and 2) increased susceptibility of transistors to soft errors induced by high energy particles. In presence of PVT variation, as transistor sizes continue to decrease, the design margins used to guarantee correct operation in the presence of worst-case scenarios have been increasing. Systems run at a clock frequency, which is determined by accounting the worst-case timing paths, operating conditions, and process variations. Timing speculation based reliable and aggressive clocking advocates going beyond worst-case limits to achieve best performance while not avoiding, but detecting and correcting a modest number of timing errors. Such design methodology exploits the fact that timing critical paths are rarely exercised in a design, and typical execution happens much faster than the timing requirements dictated by worst-case scenarios. Better-than-worst-case design methodology is advocated by several recent research pursuits, which propose to exploit in-built fault tolerance mechanisms to enhance computer system performance. Recent works have also shown that the performance lose due to over provisioning base on worst-case design margins is upward of 20 % in terms operating frequency and upward of 50 % in terms of power efficiency. The threat of soft error induced system failure in computing systems has become more prominent as we adopt ultra-deep submicron process technologies. With respect to soft error susceptibility, decreasing transistor geometries lower the energy threshold needed by high-energy particles to induce errors. As this trend continues, the need for fault tolerance mechanisms to counteract this effect has moved from a nice <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> requirement in current and future systems. In this dissertation, RAKSHA (meaning to protect and save in Sanskrit), we take a multidimensional look at the challenges of system design built with scaled-technologies using high integrity techniques. In RAKSHA, to mitigate soft errors, we propose lightweight high-integrity mechanisms as basic system building blocks which allow system to offer performance levels comparable to a non-fault tolerant system. In addition, we also propose to effectively exploit and use the availability of fault tolerant mechanisms to allow and tolerate data-dependent failures, thus setting systems to operate at typical case circuit delays and enhance system performance. We also propose the use of novel high-integrity cells for increasing system energy efficiency and also potentially increasing system security by combating power-analysis-based side channel attacks. Such an approach allows balancing of performance, power, and security with no further overhead over the resources needed to incorporate fault tolerance. Using our framework, instead of designing circuits to meet worst-case requirements, circuits can be designed to meet typical-case requirements. In RAKSHA, we propose two efficient soft error mitigation schemes, namely Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) and Soft and Timing Error Mitigation (STEM), using the approach of multiple clocking of data for protecting combinational logic blocks from soft errors. Our first technique, SEM, based on distributed and temporal voting of three registers, unloads the soft error detection overhead from the critical path of the systems. SEM is also capable of ignoring false errors and recovers from soft errors using in-situ fast recovery avoiding recomputation. Our second technique, STEM, while tolerating soft errors, adds timing error detection capability to guarantee reliable execution in aggressively clocked designs that enhance system performance by operating beyond worst-case clock frequency. We also present a specialized low overhead clock phase management scheme that ably supports our proposed techniques. Timing annotated gate level simulations, using 45 nm libraries, of a pipelined adder-multiplier and DLX processor show that both our techniques achieve near 100...|$|E
