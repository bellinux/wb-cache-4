MAS 527 shadowed this group and summoned help, and {{with the arrival of}} MAS 528 attacked with torpedoes, causing the barge train to blow up.On 1 September MAS 529 met two Soviet gunboats while on patrol off Verkkosaari island; she engaged them by gunfire, before retiring unharmed.On 29 September MAS 528 and 529, commanded by Bianchini, encountered a Soviet convoy of a tug and barge train, escorted by a gunboat. They were able to manoeuvre into position to make a torpedo attack, but scored no hits.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>train</b> {{consisted}} <b>of</b> a {{mechanically propelled}} barge carrying 60 tons, towing three dumb <b>barges</b> each <b>of</b> which had 120 tons of goods. The largest <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> could carry 600 tons of cargo.|$|R
50|$|Early tugs used chains in {{the river}} to tow <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> up river.The low steam {{pressure}} and low power of early vessels meant that positive traction by pulling on a chain against a deadman or anchor was much more effective. In the 1830s river travel was considered dangerous, {{so much so that}} insurers would put a 25 percent premium oncargoes and vessels travelling the route.|$|R
5000|$|On August 14, 1927, a tugboat of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, towing two <b>barges</b> <b>of</b> railway rolling stock, {{collided}} with a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> rock <b>barges</b> towed by the Henry F. Wills. [...] The Thomas Willett responded, when one barge was sunk and others damaged, saving their crew.|$|R
50|$|The {{transport}} boxes {{containing the}} locomotive were shipped by the barge van Hees (owned by its captain, van Hees) and pulled upriver by the steamboat Hercules on the Rhine until it reached Cologne. As the waterline in the Rhine was low, Captain van Hees {{had to use}} horses to pull the barge instead of the steamboat, as originally planned. On 7 October, the <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> reached Cologne; the remaining distance to Nuremberg had to be covered by road because the Main was too shallow to be navigable by barge. The transport on land was disrupted by a strike of the freight forwarders in Offenbach am Main, and a different freight forwarder had to be ordered. On 26 October 1835 the transport reached Nuremberg. The steam engine was assembled in the workshops of the Johann Wilhelm Spaeth engineering works, with the assembly being observed by Stephenson's engineer William Wilson, who had travelled with the locomotive to Nuremberg. They used {{the help of the}} technical teacher Bauer and local carpenters.|$|E

40|$|On Saturday, July 28, 1990, a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> {{collided}} with the Greek tanker Shinoussa in Galveston Bay off Red Fish Island near Texas City, Texas. The first barge sank and the second began to leak while the third barge in the chain and the Shinoussa both escaped without damage. The NASA Flight Science Support Office sponsored a graduate student from SUNY - College of Environmental Science and Forestry and a student from Texas, to survey the damage. The purpose of these surveys was to correlate aircraft base data with orbital data obtained during the Space Shuttle Polarization Experiment and existing laboratory data to evaluate the potential for an application such as oil spill monitoring and mapping. NASA has no charter with the local response agencies to support oil spill monitoring and cleanup...|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges,</b> which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to new builds, {{the company also}} took on repair work, as in the late 1920s, both Good Luck, originally launched on 21 March 1904, and Motorman from 24 March 1925 were on stocks on the main slipway at the same time. Motorman, which was a twin-screw tug, fitted with two Gardner diesel engines, each developing , was used to transfer railway carriages from Carlton near Nottingham on the River Trent to Hull in 1927. 160 carriages were built by Cammell Laird for export to India. They could not be transported by rail, because they were built to Indian gauge rather than the British standard gauge, and were therefore too large. Cammell Laird ordered five dumb barges from Watsons shipyard at Gainsborough, and the tug towed <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> two <b>barges,</b> each loaded with one carriage, down the River Trent.|$|R
500|$|The {{navigation}} has {{a number}} of structures which, because of their age, have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register. At Vale Royal, the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s. A swing bridge crosses the chamber. [...] The sluice at the upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers. A swing bridge, made of wood and iron, crosses the small lock, which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s. This has three sets of gates, and could accommodate a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> four <b>barges</b> when the outer gates were used. Again, a swing bridge crosses the lock. The gates are opened by a Pelton water turbine mechanism, and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically. [...] The lock keeper's cottage is also grade II listed. It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by [...] during the 1890 reconstruction.|$|R
2500|$|Trade on {{the upper}} part of the {{navigation}} to Stowmarket was extremely limited, with just an occasional barge carrying manure to Prentice's Manure Works, and returning with guncotton, which was manufactured at an explosives works. There was more traffic between Ipswich and Bramford, as barges regularly worked to Fison's and Packard's factories. The companies paid lower tolls because they helped to maintain the lock gates and clear weeds from the channel. 30-ton barges were worked through the lower four locks in <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> two dumb <b>barges</b> with a steam-powered barge pulling them. By 1917, the undertaking was virtually bankrupt. Income amounted to around £220 per year, with expenditure running at £480, and there was no capital left. The Trustees tried to make economies, but in May 1922, with the current account overdrawn, they resolved to close the navigation from 3 June 1922.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{connection}} of a container terminal to its hinterland {{is a key}} area for competition. Therefore, more and more {{attention is paid to}} the service quality of inland transport modes such as trucks, trains and barges. An efficient allocation of internal material handling resources and the use of new strategies, such as truck appointment systems, can reduce the time vehicles spend at the terminal. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model, based on a network flow representation of the terminal, to determine the number of appointments to accept per time slot and an allocation of internal resources minimizing service times <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> and <b>barges</b> simultaneously. By comparing container terminals with and without appointment systems, we show that a truck appointment system is beneficial for trucks as well as for trains and barges...|$|R

It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by 20 yd during the 1890 reconstruction.Below the locks, a five-arched red sandstone viaduct, constructed in 1837, crosses the valley. It was built by Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again the movement of the gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|R
