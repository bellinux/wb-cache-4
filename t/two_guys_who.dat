500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|E
500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E
500|$|Former showrunners Jean and Reiss {{had left}} to produce their own series, The Critic, along with The Simpsons co-creator Brooks. The Critic was a {{short-lived}} animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would {{be a good way to}} introduce Sherman. In addition, Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ("A Star is Burns" [...] and [...] "'Round Springfield") with the staff of The Critic, to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits. In response, Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al [...] and Mike [...] were <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work.

He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.

[...] Despite his business interests, Smith explained the attraction of returning to baseball:"It's simply that baseball gets in your blood and you can't get it out. Like being a compulsive gambler or something along those lines. [...] You know when you become a manager, that you're going to be fired sooner or later, {{no matter how good}} a job you feel you are doing.

[...] One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, [...] "This is <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable â€“ that scene, it's ugly. My approach, rather than to throw it out, was to make that scene the low point." ...|$|E
