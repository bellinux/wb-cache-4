5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the tongue, {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the wings.

5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on <b>the</b> <b>underside.</b> Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of its cap {{rather than}} gills. These are {{coloured}} white at first, becoming yellow {{with age and}} olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands.

5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts.

5|$|The {{immature}} American goldfinch has a dull brown back, and <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> is pale yellow. The {{shoulders and}} tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with light brown or black.

5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E

5|$|Ventral grooves {{run from}} the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> of the body. These grooves are less {{numerous}} (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.|$|E

50|$|The {{evergreen}} {{leaves are}} leathery and thick. They are bicolored: white and quite woolly on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> and dull gray- or yellow-green and faintly hairy {{on the upper}} surfaces. The wool on <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> of <b>the</b> leaves {{is made up of}} star-shaped leaf hairs that are fused into microscopic plates. The leaf blades are oval with smooth or toothed edges, and measure 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (1.0-1.4 inches) in length.|$|R
