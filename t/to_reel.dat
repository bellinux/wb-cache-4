5|$|John Richard Deacon {{was born}} in Leicester on 19 August 1951, to Arthur Henry and Lilian Molly Deacon. His younger sister, Julie, was born five years later. His father worked at the Norwich Union {{insurance}} company and in 1960 {{the family moved to}} the dormitory town of Oadby. Deacon was known to friends and his bandmates as 'Deaks' or 'Deaky' and attended Linden Junior School in Leicester, Gartree High School and Beauchamp Grammar School in Oadby. He became interested in electronics, reading magazines on the subject and building small devices, including the modification of a reel <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> tape deck to record music directly off the radio. He studied well and achieved 8 GCE O level and 3 A level passes, all at grade A. He also enjoyed soul music in particular.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August. Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills were {{on the receiving end of}} repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> under the sustained pressure. By 4:00pm, the British defenses were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the Hill, spiking their guns as they left.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E
5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming dangerously close to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as he emerged from the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points that put him back in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E

50|$|Permanent and expeditionary {{land based}} systems usually consist of two arresting engines located {{on either side}} of the runway. The arresting engines apply braking force <b>to</b> <b>reels</b> holding the {{purchase}} tapes, which in turn slow the aircraft and bring it to a stop. The two most common methods used by land based arresting engines to apply the braking force are the rotary friction brake and the rotary hydraulic (water twister) systems. The rotary friction brake is simply a hydraulic pump coupled <b>to</b> the <b>reel</b> which applies a graduated pressure to multi-disc brakes mounted on the reel. The rotary hydraulic system is a turbine inside a water/glycol filled housing coupled <b>to</b> the <b>reel.</b> The turbulence generated in the water/glycol mixture by the turbine during the arrestment provides the resistance <b>to</b> slow the <b>reel</b> and stop the aircraft. Once the aircraft is released from the cable, the tapes and cable are retracted by an internal combustion engine or electric motor installed on the arresting engine.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{all these}} {{difficulties}} the Cardinals succeeded in treading {{water for the}} first three weeks of the month, and, after a 12-2 victory against Milwaukee on September 19, stood at 80-69 for the season, seven games ahead of Cincinnati and 8.5 games ahead of Houston. Only twelve games remained in the season. A playoff berth seemed assured. But the Cardinals proceeded <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> off a seven-game losing streak, their third of the season of seven games or longer. Included in the slide was a four-game sweep by the Astros, who won nine in a row from September 20 through September 28.|$|E
25|$|On lap 2, Schumacher took {{second from}} Alesi {{after a couple}} of {{unsuccessful}} earlier attempts. The Frenchman had been holding Schumacher up while Senna pulled out a 4-second lead. Senna and Schumacher pulled away {{from the rest of the}} pack, increasing their lead by over a second a lap. Both pitted on lap 21 but Schumacher was quicker and rejoined ahead. He pulled away to take a 10-second lead but then Senna began <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> him in. By lap 35, Verstappen, Brundle and Eddie Irvine had all got ahead of Wendlinger. As they came up to lap Éric Bernard, Verstappen tried to pass Irvine. Irvine pushed him onto the grass and Verstappen spun off, going over Irvine and tipping it into Bernard's car and then hitting Brundle, being launched into a series of barrel rolls. No-one was hurt, but Irvine was banned initially for one race, later extended to three races by the FIA after an unsuccessful appeal. By now, Alesi, who had stopped twice, was behind Hill who had only stopped once.|$|E

In 2011, George Friedman, a stage manager of the Warehouse, revealed he had a reel <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> recording of the gig secured in a safety deposit box.

500|$|Abbey Road was {{recorded}} on professional eight-track reel <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> tape machines {{rather than the}} four-track machines that were used for earlier Beatles albums such as Sgt Pepper, {{and was the first}} Beatles album not to be issued in mono. The album makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer, and the guitar played through a Leslie speaker. The Moog is not merely as a background effect but sometimes playing a central role, as in [...] "Because" [...] where it is used for the middle eight. It is also prominent on [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" [...] (played using a ribbon strip) and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". The instrument was introduced to the band by Harrison who acquired one in November 1968 and subsequently used it to create his Electronic Sound album. Starr made more prominent use of the tom-toms on Abbey Road, later saying the album was [...] "tom-tom madness ... I went nuts on the toms." ...|$|E

The bootleg sold several {{tens of thousands of}} copies, orders of magnitude more than a typical classical or opera bootleg, and its success resulted in the official release of the live album Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! later in the year.
