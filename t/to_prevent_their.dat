50|$|In the Affaire Des Fiches in France in 1904-1905, it was {{discovered}} that the anticlerical War Minister of the Combes government, General Louis André, was determining promotions based on the French Masonic Grand Orient's huge card index on public officials, detailing which were Catholic and who attended Mass, with a view <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>their</b> promotions.|$|R

5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
40|$|Wines, {{specifically}} {{those in}} which lactic acid bacteria can grow can cause transient toxic effects due {{to the formation of}} biogenic amines such as histamine and tyramine. Some people specifically avoid red wines because they are more often associated with headaches and other discomforts. An understanding of the origin, occurrence and formation of amines in grape and berry wines will lead to developing approaches <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>their</b> formation...|$|R
50|$|L'Affaire des Fiches de délation (“affair of {{the cards}} of denunciation”) was a {{political}} scandal in France in 1904 - 1905 {{in which it was}} discovered that the militantly anticlerical War Minister under Emile Combes, General Louis André, was determining promotions based on religious behavior. Using members of the Freemasons to watch officers, André assembled a huge card index on public officials, detailing which were Catholic and who attended Mass, with a view <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>their</b> promotions.|$|R

5|$|Both ships served during World War I. Moltke {{participated in}} several major battles {{with the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea. At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> seizure by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, Von der Tann, {{along with}} most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a {{decision}} by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end in 1919 when German caretaker crews scuttled their ships <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> division among Allied navies. The wreck was raised in 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1931 to 1934.|$|E
5|$|In World War I, {{the thin}} armor of British battlecruisers {{did not serve}} them well in combat with their better-armored German {{counterparts}} and three were lost at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. SMS Lützow, a German battlecruiser, was also sunk during the battle. Five German battlecruisers were scuttled by their crews in 1919 <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> seizure by the Royal Navy after the First Armistice at Compiègne in 1918.|$|E

In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} ended {{three days}} before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes in their mouths <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> breath showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted on the cable. In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy.

If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|The town escaped heavy bombing {{during the}} Second World War, but the sea front {{incurred}} great damage {{when it was}} fortified against invasion. The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> use by enemy ships. The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines {{at the foot of}} the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.|$|E
5|$|When bin Saud took Medina in 1805, Muhammad's tomb was {{stripped}} of its gold and jewel ornaments. Adherents to Wahhabism, bin Saud's followers destroyed nearly every tomb dome in Medina in order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> veneration, and the one of Muhammad {{is said to have}} narrowly escaped. Similar events took place in 1925 when the Saudi militias retook—and this time managed to keep—the city. In the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, burial is to take place in unmarked graves. Although frowned upon by the Saudis, many pilgrims continue to practice a ziyarat—a ritual visit—to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} most modern units of the High Seas Fleet, Brummer and Bremse were {{included}} in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers. The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 in single file, commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. They were met at sea by a combined fleet of 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet arrived in the Firth of Forth later that day, and between 25 and 27 November, they were escorted to Scapa Flow. Upon arrival, all wireless equipment was removed from the ships and the breech blocks of their heavy guns taken <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> use. Crews were reduced to minimum levels.|$|E
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E
