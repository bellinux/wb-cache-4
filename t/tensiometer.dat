5000|$|A <b>tensiometer</b> in {{soil science}} is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to determine}} the matric water potential (...) (soil moisture tension) in the vadose zone. This device typically consists of a glass or plastic tube with a porous ceramic cup, and is filled with water. The top of the tube has either a built-in vacuum gauge or a rubber cap used with a portable puncture <b>tensiometer</b> instrument, which uses a hypodermic needle to measure the pressure inside the <b>tensiometer.</b> The <b>tensiometer</b> is buried in the soil, and a hand pump is used to pull a partial vacuum. As water is pulled out of the soil by plants and evaporation, the vacuum inside the tube increases. As water is added to the soil, the vacuum inside the tube pulls moisture from the soil and decreases. As the water in <b>tensiometer</b> is considered to be equilibrium with the soil water, the gauge reading of the <b>tensiometer</b> represents the matric potential of the soil.|$|E

In this study, resistance blocks and <b>tensiometers</b> were compared to neutron probe readings to assess how well these devices followed soil moisture and whether the resistance blocks and /or <b>tensiometers</b> {{could be used to}} schedule irrigation in cotton production. The resistance blocks were placed at 6, 18, and 30 inches. <b>Tensiometers</b> were placed at 18 and 30 inches. The readings from the resistance blocks and <b>tensiometers</b> were compared to neutron probe readings taken at 6, 18, and 30 inches. The resistance blocks compared well with the neutron probe readings at the 6 inch and 30 inch depth. At the 18 inch depth, there was much scatter in the data. The <b>tensiometers</b> also showed good comparisons at 30 inches and poor comparisons at 18 inches...|$|R
50|$|In the {{unsaturated}} zone, the {{pore pressure}} {{is determined by}} capillarity and is {{also referred to as}} tension, suction, or matric pressure. Pore water pressures under unsaturated conditions (vadose zone) are measured in with <b>tensiometers.</b> <b>Tensiometers</b> operate by allowing the pore water to come into equilibrium with a reference pressure indicator through a permeable ceramic cup placed in contact with the soil.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tensiometers</b> are {{commonly}} used for measuring soil water matric pressures. Unfortunately, the water-filled reservoir of conventional <b>tensiometers</b> limits their applicability to soil water matric pressures above approximately – 0. 085 MPa. <b>Tensiometers</b> filled with a polymer solution instead of water are able to measure a larger range of soil water matric pressures. We designed and constructed six prototype polymer <b>tensiometers</b> (previously called osmotic <b>tensiometers)</b> consisting of a wide-range pressure transducer with a temperature sensor, a stainless steel casing, and a ceramic plate with a membrane preventing polymer leakage. A polymer chamber (0. 1 – 2. 2 cm 3) was located between the pressure transducer and the plate. We tested the polymer <b>tensiometers</b> for long-term operation, the effects of temperature, response times, and performance in a repacked sandy loam under laboratory conditions. Several months of continuous operation caused a gradual drop in the osmotic pressure, for which we developed a suitable correction. The osmotic potential of polymer solutions is temperature dependent, and requires calibration before installation. The response times to sudden and gradual changes in ambient temperature {{were found to be}} affected by polymer chamber height and polymer type. Practically useful response times (< 0. 2 d) are feasible, particularly for chambers shorter than 0. 20 cm. We demonstrated the ability of the instrument to measure the range of soil water pressures in which plant roots are able to take up water (from 0 to – 1. 6 MPa), to regain pressure without user interference and to function properly for time periods of up to 1 yr...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} design and construction of an artificial rain simulator system and&# 13; the results obtained with regards to suction-rainfall response of a cut slope in unsaturated residual soil&# 13; of weathered sandstone of various weathering grades. From the field measurements, the shallow&# 13; <b>tensiometers</b> are found to record an immediate initial increase in matric suction within the first 20 min&# 13; of the simulated rain before a gradual drop in suction takes place. However no such initial spikes in&# 13; suction readings were recorded by the deeper <b>tensiometers.</b> With constant rainfall for the next 130 min,&# 13; a clear drop in soil suction was observed in all cases illustrating the effect of net infiltration process. &# 13; Positive pore water pressure was even recorded {{by some of the}} deeper <b>tensiometers.</b> The suction&# 13; recorded by the shallow <b>tensiometers</b> was always higher than those of the deeper tensiometers,&# 13; indicating a reduction in suction with depth below the ground surface. In term of weathering grades,&# 13; residual soil of weathered sandstone of weathering grade III has the highest infiltration rate indicating&# 13; the more porous nature of this soil material.

40|$|Measuring {{soil water}} {{potentials}} {{is crucial to}} characterize vadose zone processes. Conventional <b>tensiometers</b> only measure until approximately - 0. 09 MPa, and indirect methods may suffer from the non-uniqueness {{in the relationship between}} matric potential and measured properties. Recently developed polymer <b>tensiometers</b> (POTs) are able to directly measure soil matric potentials until the theoretical wilting point (- 1. 6 MPa). By minimizing the volume of polymer solution inside the POT while maximizing the ceramic area in contact with that polymer solution, response times drop to acceptable ranges for laboratory and field conditions. Contact with the soil is drastically improved with the use of cone-shaped solid ceramics instead of flat ceramics. The comparison between measured potentials by polymer <b>tensiometers</b> and indirectly obtained potentials with time domain reflectometry highlights the risk of using the latter method at low water contents. By combining POT and time domain reflectometry readings in situ moisture retention curves can be measured over the range permitted by the measurement range of both POT and time domain reflectometr...|$|R

5000|$|One of his key {{interests}} was {{the energy}} status of soil water, and {{he led the}} way in developing new and improved methods of measuring soil water potential. Early in his career, Richards recognised the importance of capillary potential to plant-soil relations, and described the principles, construction and operation of the <b>tensiometer.</b> Richards also proposed the tension plate apparatus for determining capillary potential in soil. The <b>tensiometer</b> was developed from the idea of using a semi-permeable, porous ceramic material to balance a pressure potential against a matric potential; once equilibrium had established, the matric potential of the soil could be determined by balancing the pressure potential.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: In {{irrigation}} water management, {{irrigation water}} use represents a&# 13; substantial opportunity for agriculture water savings. Automation of irrigation systems, based on Soil&# 13; Moisture Sensors Systems (SMSS) {{has the potential}} to provide maximum water use efficiency by&# 13; maintaining soil moisture at optimum levels. Approach: The objective of this research was to evaluate&# 13; the performance of soil moisture sensors under field conditions during growing season in two different&# 13; irrigated. This evaluation to be conducted with regard to accuracy; precision; quickness of the response&# 13; to moisture variation. Moreover to quantify the easiness of use, this encompasses installing and&# 13; operating the instrument as well as interpreting the readings. Results: The Watermark resulted in&# 13; higher tension readings than the <b>tensiometers.</b> While Watermark showed a consistent and increasingly&# 13; drier estimate of water content compared to <b>tensiometers.</b> However, the trend of soil water tension&# 13; curves that resulted from both treatments was very similar. The linear relationships of the Soil&# 13; Moisture Content (SMC) obtained from all sensors and gravimetric measurement were observed to be&# 13; best fit. The correlations (R 2) are ranging from 0. 96 - 0. 98 and from 0. 91 - 0. 95 for <b>tensiometers</b> and&# 13; watermarks successively. The statistical analyses indicate that changeability existed between soil water&# 13; contents by the sensors and the gravimetric method. Conclusion: Soil Moisture Sensors Systems&# 13; (SMSS) can be used: To monitor soil moisture sensors under wheat crop cultivation practices using&# 13; intelligent irrigation system. The <b>tensiometers</b> and Watermarks were less responsive to the soil drying&# 13; between irrigations than GM. So, Watermark can operate in a drier range than <b>tensiometers,</b> but with a&# 13; lower resolution at the wet end of soil water tension. Anyhow, watermark remains a good tool for&# 13; automatic irrigation scheduling and be integrated with inelegant irrigation systems even the noted&# 13; drawbacks. </div...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Tensiometer</b> as {{it applies}} to physics is an {{instrument}} used to measure the surface tension (...) of liquids or surfaces.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>tensiometer</b> and pendant drop techniques, the sessile drop technique {{can be used in}} some cases to separate the known total surface energy of a liquid into its components.
