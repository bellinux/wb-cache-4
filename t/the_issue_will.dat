5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Josh {{tries to}} end a deadlock on {{the appointment of a}} 6th Circuit federal court judge. His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could even begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E
25|$|Certain animals, {{including}} {{bats and}} cetaceans, {{have the ability}} to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Cheke {{pointed out}} that some {{descriptions}} after 1662 use the names [...] "Dodo" [...] and [...] "Dodaers" [...] when referring to the red rail, indicating {{that they had been}} transferred to it after the disappearance of the dodo itself. Cheke therefore points to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. A 1668 account by English traveller John Marshall, who used the names [...] "Dodo" [...] and [...] "Red Hen" [...] interchangeably for the red rail, mentioned that the meat was [...] "hard", which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by Errol Fuller, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail. Until this explanation was proposed, a description of [...] "dodos" [...] from 1681 was thought to be the last account, and that date still has proponents. Recently accessible Dutch manuscripts indicate that no dodos were seen by settlers in 1664–1674. It is unlikely <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> ever be resolved, unless late reports mentioning the name alongside a physical description are rediscovered. The IUCN Red List accepts Cheke's rationale for choosing the 1662 date, taking all subsequent reports to refer to red rails. In any case, the dodo was probably extinct by 1700, about a century after its discovery in 1598. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, but by then the dodo and most of the large terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct.|$|E
500|$|Once in Philadelphia, Dennie {{resumed his}} {{editorial}} {{career with the}} Gazette of the United States, a Federalist-friendly newspaper. In 1800 Dennie, along with Philadelphia bookseller Asbury Dickens, began work on the Port Folio. Under the pseudonym Oliver Oldschool, Esq., Dennie wrote, in 1803, a scathing attack on Jeffersonian democracy, {{for which he was}} brought up on charges of seditious libel. Dennie wrote, in part:A democracy is scarcely tolerable at any period of national history. Its omens are always sinister, and its powers are unpropitious. It is on its trial here, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> be civil war, desolation, and anarchy. No wise man but discerns its imperfections, no good man but shudders at its miseries, no honest man but proclaims its fraud, and no brave man but draws his sword against its force. The institution of a scheme of policy so radically contemptible and vicious is a memorable example of what the villany of some men can devise, the folly of others receive, and both establish in spite of reason, reflection, and sensation. This paragraph was reprinted in Federalist newspapers throughout the country. While Dennie was acquitted, the severity of the attacks leveled in Port Folio would henceforth be lessened. However, when Dennie criticized democracy, it was not the republican democracy found in the United States today, but rather the [...] "democracy" [...] found in France under Robespierre and Napoleon. Dennie was invoking Aristotle's argument that [...] "an absolute democracy is not to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. It is the corruption and degeneracy, and not the sound constitution of a republic." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{psychologist}} Kenneth Zucker and {{the psychiatrist}} Susan Bradley called Sexual Preference a [...] "classic study". Zucker and Bradley maintained that its data {{are consistent with}} those of previous clinical research, including Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962), with Bell et al.′s finding that [...] "detached-hostile father" [...] is relatively characteristic of a majority of the white homosexual men in their study and a minority of white heterosexual men being similar to what was reported by Bieber et al. Zucker and Bradley wrote that the psychoanalytic perspective that views homosexuality as a mental disorder and explains it in terms of family dynamics influenced the way in which Bell et al. conducted their inquiry, and that Sexual Preference must be understood in the context of sexual politics. They suggested that because homosexuality had been delisted as a mental disorder for eight years by the time the book was published, Bell et al. faced a problem if their data [...] "showed a departure from an ideal of optimal functioning in homosexual men". Zucker and Bradley argued that, because of their concern for homosexuals, and also influenced by political correctness, Bell et al. deliberately minimized the [...] "observed significant effects" [...] shown by their study, though they noted that this was also in part an objective interpretation of weak effects. Zucker and Bradley wrote that prior to Bell et al.′s study, researchers were aware that phenomena usually interpreted as parents influencing their children could be interpreted instead as the reverse, and that Bell et al. recognized that [...] "the direction of effects" [...] was a [...] "problematic aspect of their research design". In Zucker and Bradley′s view, resolving the [...] "direction-of-effects issue" [...] raised by Bell et al. through retrospective studies comparing homosexual with heterosexual men will be difficult, and that until then <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> remain [...] "a matter of theoretical taste." ...|$|E

Regarding the third requirement of the Karaha Bodas test, the Court did not expressly decide whether a private right was involved as the Attorney-General did not raise this issue.

2500|$|To {{preserve}} that {{institutional memory}} {{and continue to}} attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay. [...] Some have suggested an incentive plan that focuses on employees' internal motivation. [...] Instead of cash bonuses or raises, employees may instead be given discretionary {{time to work on}} creative projects in which they have a personal interest, as has been implemented by companies such as [...] [...] Another alternative to a strictly intrinsically based model may be a hybrid in which monetary rewards and intrinsic incentives are offered, giving the employees of both dispositions the motivation to increase performance. [...] It is unclear what the next step of action will be for the federal government, but since the issue of pay for performance is so politically popular it is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>will</b> go away any time soon.|$|E
