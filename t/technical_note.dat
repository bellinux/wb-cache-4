500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a <b>technical</b> <b>note,</b> GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E
