These include gender, age, occupation, religion, and level of education.

25|$|Woodblock {{printing}} (diaoban yinshua 雕版印刷), {{known as}} xylography today, {{was the first}} method of printing applied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> medium. It became widely used throughout East Asia both as a method for printing on textiles and later, {{under the influence of}} Buddhism, on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to about 220. Ukiyo-e is the best known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term woodcut (see below), except for the block-books produced mainly in the fifteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the critics}} of the views put forward in this book was a Jesuit, Francis Line (1595–1675), and it was while {{answering}} his objections that Boyle made his first mention {{of the law that}} the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name. The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was Henry Power in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to Richard Towneley. In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to Edme Mariotte, although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time.|$|E

500|$|The Soviet {{scientists}} {{had planned to}} euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or {{that she had been}} euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating.

500|$|Although the cyclone's [...] "best track" [...] listings by both Météo-France and the JTWC end at 0600 UTC on January 15, its {{residual}} tropical low remained {{distinct and}} active as it continued generally westward across the southern African continent. Where nearly all landfalling tropical cyclones {{in the area}} recurve toward the south or dissipate quickly on moving ashore, a rare synoptic pattern allowed the remnants of Bonita to persist, moving over northern Zimbabwe on January 16. For the next two days, the weakening storm remained prominent on satellite imagery, ultimately moving {{off the coast of}} Angola and entering the South Atlantic Ocean on January 19. By the next day, the system had succumbed to cold waters and days of land interaction, dissipating completely. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> published by the Zambia Meteorological Department, Bonita was the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South-West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|The large cent was {{replaced}} by a smaller version made of 88% copper and 12% nickel in 1857. In 1861, the Civil War began, and when efforts to finance the war via borrowing failed, the Treasury stopped paying out gold in December 1861. [...] The United States shifted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> money-based economy with little disruption. By June 1862, the price of silver had risen to the point where coins of that metal vanished from circulation, many exported to Canada, where they were both acceptable in circulation, and could be exchanged for gold. This departure of low-value coins was far more disruptive to commerce than the loss of the high-denomination gold coins, and change in transactions was made by a variety of makeshifts. These included currency issues by cities and businesses, encased postage stamps, and federally issued fractional currency—paper notes in denominations as small as three cents. [...] The low-value paper currency, whether issued by government or business, were called shinplasters by the public, which disliked them. On the Pacific Coast, where paper money was not favored, silver and gold continued to circulate.|$|E

500|$|Pluto's {{rotation}} period, its day, {{is equal}} to 6.39 Earth days. Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its [...] "side" [...] in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness. The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from University of Arizona has suggested {{that it may be}} due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called polar wander. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorientate itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to , causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth if the Antarctic ice sheet was several times larger.|$|E
