25|$|My idea {{suggested}} to that gentleman {{was to write}} a story in which the principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the struggles of feeling between the love for his child and his love of money, should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were mixed up in the Rebellion of '45, I suggested that the story should be of that date, in order <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> introduce some scenes and circumstances connected with that great party struggle, and also wishing to let the public of the present day have a peep at the places of public amusement of the period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions of those places which are now copied and produced upon the stage; and I take this opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very excellent and effective manner in which he has dramatised the story.|$|E

He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|In the hospice's {{founding}} charter, {{signed in}} August 1443, Rolin wrote that [...] "disregarding all human concerns {{and in the}} interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital." [...] In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. [...] Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, {{played a major role in}} the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.|$|E
500|$|... "Right Round" [...] {{was written}} by Flo Rida, Dr. Luke, Kool Kojak, DJ Frank E, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and Dead or Alive, the band whose 1984 song, [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] is sampled in the chorus. The track was {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha, (who was not credited on the American release of the single). At the end of 2008, Luke {{was working on a}} track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round" [...] and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals. According to Flo Rida, the song is about [...] "a young lady, she might be in the strip club and she's got my head spinning round, [...] Or any young lady <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> see walking past me that's getting my attention. She got it going on! I'm going crazy over her." ...|$|E

500|$|Agnes and {{her sister}} were virgins of Rome {{in the time of}} the Emperor Constantine, though all figures are shown in {{contemporary}} 14th-century dress. The story begins {{on the inside of the}} bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a chaperon. She holds a book inscribed Miserere mei Deus sancte ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi ("Thy words have I hid in my heart <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not sin against thee". [...] ). [...] The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' martyrdom in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned it down for a more bubblegum-pop voice. The songs on the album reflect this {{and a number of}} instruments were used in the songs to bring out the different moods which the lyrics emphasized. [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992. [...] "At the time we were doing the groove stuff on the True Blue album, it was semi-innovative. There wasn't a precedent that made you gag. God forbid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have contributed to the mess we're in now." ...|$|E

500|$|Coghill told Australian Times {{that the}} final tour is [...] "going to be great fun, but it's {{also going to be}} sad". He {{confirmed}} that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project. Instead he intended to finish his degree, [...] "nce I'm done with <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> put the feelers out and see what's happening. I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just {{to have a chance to}} keep playing. I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore". Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was [...] "These Days". On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, [...] "I'm on Your Side", as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, , containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection, combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena and the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band. Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in the previous October during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.|$|E
500|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} Angela Frandina, who was found strangled in her bed clutching a note reading, [...] "Ed did it", although it proves to be a false lead. Their investigation leads the detectives to discover Angela had several strange boyfriends and worked at an S fashion store and a phone sex hotline. The two detectives visit the Eastern Shores Marketing Phone Sex operation where they speak with the manager, Ed. [...] Ed tells them about a boyfriend of Angela's named Chris Novoselic (Dan Garrett) who used {{to spend time with}} her at an S club called 'The Eve of Destruction' on Fayette Street. [...] Pembleton and Bayliss go to the Eve of Destruction to question Novoselic. [...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you do <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have to kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists everybody has a darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store and ask about leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss a leather jacket as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E

2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999.

You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> praise Thee.

2500|$|After playing five {{first class}} games and taking 17 wickets, Thomson was a {{surprise}} selection in for the second test against Pakistan.
