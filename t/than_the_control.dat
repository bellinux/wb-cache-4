Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret.

5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

500|$|An {{association}} between circumcision and reduced heterosexual HIV infection rates was suggested in 1986. [...] Experimental evidence {{was needed to}} establish a causal relationship, so three randomized controlled trials were commissioned {{as a means to}} reduce the effect of any confounding factors.

All three trials were stopped early by their monitoring boards on ethical grounds because those in the circumcised group had a lower rate of HIV contraction <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> group. Subsequently, the World Health Organization promoted circumcision in high-risk populations as part of an overall program to reduce the spread of HIV, although some have challenged the validity of the African randomized controlled trials, prompting a number of researchers to question the effectiveness of circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy. The Male Circumcision Clearinghouse website was formed in 2009 by WHO, UNAIDS, FHI and AVAC to provide current evidence-based guidance, information, and resources to support the delivery of safe male circumcision services in countries that choose to scale up the procedure as one component of comprehensive HIV prevention services.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Bruton’s {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) is a signaling molecule that plays {{important roles in}} B- 1 B cell development and innate myeloid cell functions and has recently {{been identified as a}} target for therapy of B cell lymphomas. We examined the contribu-tion of B- 1 B cells to resistance to Cryptococcus neoformans infection by utilizing X-linked immunodeficient (XID) mice (CBA-CaHN-XID), which possess a mutation in Btk. XID mice had significantly higher brain fungal burdens <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> 6 weeks after infection with C. neoformans strain 52 D (CN 52 D); however, consistent with the propensity for greater virulence of C. neo-formans strain H 99 (CNH 99), CNH 99 -infected XID mice had higher lung and brain fungal burdens <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> 3 weeks after infection. Further studies in a chronic CN 52 D model revealed markedly lower levels of total and C. neoformans-specific serum IgM in XID mice <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> mice 1 and 6 weeks after infection. Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis was markedly impaired in CN 52 D-infected XID mice compared to <b>the</b> <b>controls,</b> with XID mice exhibiting a disorganized lung inflammatory pattern in which Gomori silver staining revealed significantly more enlarged, extracellular C. neoformans cells <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> Adoptive transfer of B- 1 B cells to XID mice restored peritoneal B- 1 B cells but did not restore IgM levels to those of <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> and had no effect on the brain fungal burden at 6 weeks.
