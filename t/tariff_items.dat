40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying tariff ceilings or harmonization formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower product coverage of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the product coverage of GSP schemes in high <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP product coverage and margins in higher <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high <b>tariff</b> <b>items.</b> Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs.  Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between foreign policy and domestic policy, through an assessment of the Brazilian plea for change of Mercosur’s Common External Tariff (CET) of dairy products. Since 1995, Brazil has adopted an exception tariff level for a set of <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> of milk and dairy products. In total, currently there are 11 tariff codes of dairy products in the Brazilian List of Exceptions to the CET, with a tariff level of 27 %, in contrast with a CET established between 14 % and 16 %. The analysis that is done is that such tariff level that is applied by Brazil has been presenting itself as being an equilibrium level, which, combined with a set of public policies, has been enabling the development of the sector, with important results along the past years. In this sense, and taking into account that the extinction of the National Lists of Exceptions to the CET is defined by a Mercosur decision, we evaluate as relevant that the country undertake efforts for consolidating the tariff level that it has been practicing (so far, as an exception measure) as the level of the Common External Tariff of the regional bloc...|$|E

40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Although average tariffs in Quad {{markets are}} very low, tariff peaks and tariff {{escalation}} have a disproportional effect on exports from {{least developed countries}} (LDCs).

Thirdly, to establish North-East Asian Agro-valley is needed. After forming food production belt that connects Korea, Hokkaido in Japan, and the three north-eastern provinces in China, it is possible to realize high value-added agriculture with producing and processing of complementary food for partner country.

2500|$|Law's {{chance to}} make his mark came {{with the issue of}} tariff reform. To cover the costs of the Second Boer War, Lord Salisbury's Chancellor of the Exchequer (Michael Hicks Beach) {{suggested}} introducing import taxes or tariffs on foreign metal, flour and grain coming into Britain. Such tariffs had previously existed in Britain, but the last of these had been abolished in the 1870s because of the free trade movement. A duty was now introduced on imported corn. The issue became [...] "explosive", dividing the British political world, and continued even after Salisbury retired and was replaced as Prime Minister by his nephew, Arthur Balfour. Law took advantage of this, making his first major speech on 22 April 1902, in which he argued that while he felt a general tariff was unnecessary, an imperial customs union (which would put <b>tariffs</b> on <b>items</b> from outside the British Empire, instead of on every nation but Britain) was a good idea, particularly since other nations such as Germany and the United States had increasingly high tariffs. Using his business experience, he made a [...] "plausible case" [...] that there was no proof that tariffs led to increases in the cost of living, as the Liberals had argued. Again his memory came into good use– when William Harcourt accused Law of misquoting him, Law was able to precisely give the place in Hansard where Harcourt's speech was to be found.|$|R
40|$|Although theory {{suggests}} that the real exchange rate should depreciate after a credible trade liberalization but could appreciate temporarily with a noncredible one, little empirical evidence exists. Unlike existing studies that use either indirect tests or unreliable openness measures, this paper uses an event study based on carefully documented trade liberalization in 45 countries. The result shows that real exchange rates depreciate after countries open their economies to trade. In countries with multiple liberalization episodes, however, real exchange rates appreciate during early episodes, suggesting that partial or noncredible trade liberalizations are associated with real appreciation.

40|$|Objective: To estimate, {{from the}} {{hospital}} perspective in Germany, the cost effectiveness of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium 40 mg once daily (ENOX) relative to no pharmacological prophylaxis (NPP) and relative to subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 IU three times daily (low-dose UFH [LDUFH]). Each is used in addition to elastic bandages/compression stockings and physiotherapy {{in the prevention of}} venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in immobilised acutely ill medical inpatients without impaired renal function or extremes of body weight. Methods: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the `additional cost for ENOX per clinical VTE avoided versus NPP' and `additional cost for ENOX per episode of major bleeding avoided versus LDUFH' were chosen as target variables. The target variables were quantified using a modelling approach based on the decision-tree technique. Resource use during thromboprophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTEs, episode of major bleeding and secondary pneumonia after pulmonary embolism (PE) was collected from a hospital survey. Costs were exclusively those to hospitals incurred by staff expenses, drugs, devices, disposables, laboratory tests and equipment for diagnostic procedures. These costs were determined by multiplying utilised resource items by the price or <b>tariff</b> of each <b>item</b> as of the first quarter of 2003. Safety and efficacy values of the comparators were taken from the MEDENOX (prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin) and the THE-PRINCE (THromboEmbolism-PRevention IN Cardiac or respiratory disease with Enoxaparin) trials and from a meta-analysis. The evaluation encompassed 8 (6 - 14) days of thromboprophylaxis plus time to treat VTE and episode of major bleeding in hospital. Point estimates of all model parameters were applied exclusively in the base-case analysis. Results: There were incremental costs of _ 1106 for ENOX per clinical VTE avoided versus NPP (_ 1 _ ~=_$US 1. 07; average of the first quarter of 2003). ENOX dominated LDUFH: cost savings of _ 55 _ 825 were obtained and 7. 7 episodes of major bleeding were avoided by ENOX compared with LDUFH, each per 1000 patients. In comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the robustness of the model and its results was shown. Conclusions: Results of this evaluation suggest that, in immobilised acutely ill medical inpatients, ENOX may offer hospitals in Germany a very cost-effective option for thromboprophylaxis compared with NPP and a cost-saving alternative compared with LDUFH.
