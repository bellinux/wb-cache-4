5000|$|In {{addition}} to the conventional [...] "Temperature Scan" [...] DLTS, in which the temperature is swept while pulsing the device at a constant frequency, one can keep the temperature constant and sweep the pulsing frequency. This technique is called the Frequency Scan DLTS. In theory the frequency and <b>temperature</b> <b>scan</b> DLTS should yield same results. Frequency scan DLTS is specifically useful when an aggressive change in temperature might damage the device. An example when frequency scan is shown to be useful is for studying modern MOS devices with thin and sensitive gate oxides.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conventional}} DLTS {{the capacitance}} transients are investigated {{by using a}} lock-in amplifier [...] or double box-car averaging technique when the sample temperature is slowly varied (usually in a range from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature 300 K or above). The equipment reference frequency is the voltage pulse repetition rate. In the conventional DLTS method this frequency multiplied by some constant (depending on the hardware used) is called the [...] "rate window". During the <b>temperature</b> <b>scan,</b> peaks appear when the emission rate of carriers from some defect equals the rate window. By setting up different rate windows in subsequent DLTS spectra measurements one obtains different temperatures at which some particular peak appears. Having a set of the emission rate and corresponding temperature pairs one can make an Arrhenius plot, which allows for the deduction of defect activation energy for the thermal emission process. Usually this energy (sometimes called the defect energy level) together with the plot intercept value are defect parameters used for its identification or analysis.On samples with low free carrier density conductance transients have also been used for a DLTS analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanism}} of the lamellar/inverted cubic (QII) phase transition is related to that of membrane fusion in lipid systems. N-Monomethyl-ated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE-Me) exhibits this transition and is commonly used to in-vestigate the effects of exogenous substances, such as viral fusion peptides, on the {{mechanism of}} membrane fusion. We studied DOPE-Me phase behavior {{as a first step}} in evaluating the effects of membrane-spanning peptides on inverted phase formation and membrane fusion. These measurements show that: a) the onset temperatures for QII and inverted hexago-nal (HII) phase formation both are <b>temperature</b> <b>scan</b> rate-dependent; b) longer pre-incubation times at low temperature and lower <b>temperature</b> <b>scan</b> rates favor formation of the QII phase; and c) in temperature-jump experiments between 61 and 65 C, the meta-stableHII phase forms initially, and disappears slowly while the QII phase develops. These observations are rationalized {{in the context of a}} mechanism for both the lamellar/non-lamellar phase transition and the related process of membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|Cold-induced {{precipitation}} of a monoclonal IgM cryoglobulin {{isolated from}} a patient with Waldenström 2 ̆ 7 s macroglobulinemia was observed to have a negative activation enthalpy. The rate of the reaction increased, as the temperature decreased. Differential scanning calorimetry of the monoclonal IgM showed precipitation as an inverted peak during a downward <b>temperature</b> <b>scan.</b> The transition temperature was between 14 and 15 °C and was possibly concentration dependent. At temperatures below the transition the precipitation was best described by second-order kinetics. The difference in change in enthalpy between precipitation and disassociation suggests that cold-induced precipitation had a fast precipitation stage followed by a slower consolidation reaction. Negligible curvature of the Eyring plot suggested the precipitation reaction was dominated by van der Waal forces and hydrogen bonding. Conversely, during an upward <b>temperature</b> <b>scan,</b> disassociation was observed as a positive enthalpy peak.

The cure {{kinetics}} of an {{epoxy resin}} with surface modified silica filler (Nanopox F 400 resin) and without silica filler (DGEBA resin), cured with an amine curing agent, DDS at an N-H/epoxy molar ratio of 1. 1 : 1 was studied by Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry in two basic modes; Dynamic <b>temperature</b> <b>scanning</b> and Isothermal <b>temperature</b> <b>scanning.</b> Dynamic <b>temperature</b> <b>scanning</b> analysis {{suggests that the}} addition of surface modified silica nanoparticles in the epoxy resin increases the rate of reaction by acting as a catalyst. The hydroxyl groups in silica nanoparticles catalyze the cure reaction by shifting the exothermic peak towards the lower temperature. Under dynamic <b>temperature</b> <b>scanning,</b> the glass transition temperature (Tg) was lower for the Nanopox F 400 system than the unfilled control system. The glass transition temperature {{and changes in the}} Tg found in DSC analysis were in line with TMA analysis and DMA analysis. Isothermal scanning analysis shows that the control system follows the Kamal autocatalytic model whereas Nanopox F 400 system follows the modified Kamal autocatalytic model. The model parameters were determined by a nonlinear multiple regression method. The mechanical properties of Nanopox F 400 resin and control resin both cured with DDS at an N-H/epoxy molar ratio of 1. 1 : 1 were examined by tensile testing.

40|$|The {{saturation}} transfer {{electron spin}} resonance (STESR) spectra of 10 different positional isomers of phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled in the sn- 2 chain have been investigated in the low temperature phases of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. The results of continuous wave saturation and of saturation recovery measurements on the conventional ESR spectra were used to define the saturation properties necessary for interpreting the STESR results {{in terms of the}} chain dynamics. Spin labels with the nitroxide group located {{in the center of the}} chain tended to segregate preferentially from the DPPC host lipids in the more ordered phases, causing spin-spin interactions which produced spectral broadening and had a very pronounced effect on the saturation characteristics of the labels. This was accompanied by a large decrease in the STESR spectral intensities and diagnostic line height ratios relative to those of spin labels that exhibited a higher degree of saturation at the same microwave power. The temperature dependence of the STESR spectra of the different spin label isomers revealed a sharp increase in the rate of rotation about the long axis of the lipid chains at approximately 25 degrees C, correlating with the pretransition of gel phase DPPC bilayers, and a progressive increase in the segmental motion towards the terminal methyl end of the chains in all phases. Prolonged incubation at low temperatures led to an increase in the diagnostic STESR line height ratios in all regions of the spectrum, reflecting the decrease in chain mobility accompanying formation of the subgel phase. Continuous recording of the central diagnostic peak height of the STESR spectra while scanning the temperature revealed a discontinuity at approximately 14 - 17 degrees C, corresponding to the DPPC subtransition which occurred only on the initial upward <b>temperature</b> <b>scan,</b> in addition to the discontinuity at 29 - 31 degrees C corresponding to the pretransition which displayed hysteresis on the downward <b>temperature</b> <b>scan...</b>|$|E
