5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E

25|$|Computational {{complexity}} theory is {{a branch of}} the theory of computation that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.|$|E

25|$|At {{right is}} pictured the {{national}} flower of Bhutan (Meconopsis gakyidiana), commonly called the blue poppy (though taxonomically {{it is not}} of the poppy Genus or species, but only poppy-like; thus it cannot produce opiom or its derivatives). The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) was the source of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its misclassification as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce viable seeds, causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E
25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E
25|$|While {{concrete}} {{figures are}} difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that {{there are at least}} 600,000 children involved in forced begging. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though {{there is no way of}} knowing whether it was through forced means.|$|E

500|$|As {{supply ship}} losses mounted, the RCN {{struggled}} {{to catch up}} to the better-equipped British and American navies. Macdonald himself lacked military expertise and often depended on senior naval staff who kept him in the dark about equipment shortages and other problems. [...] "Macdonald's administration of Naval Affairs did not rise to brilliance", Henderson writes, [...] " [...] <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> have lain more with the senior naval staff than with Macdonald". Macdonald's conflict with high ranking naval officers, particularly Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles, led to the effective dismissal of the latter in 1944. Yet, as the war progressed, the RCN, led by Macdonald, gradually became more effective in protecting the huge cargoes of materials on which Allied victory depended.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers. The {{television}} miniseries {{is based}} on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose. Although Band of Brothers was met with largely positive reception, Schwimmer's performance was criticized; the BBC News concluded, [...] "Part of <b>the</b> <b>problem...</b> <b>may</b> have been the ridiculous fact that Friends favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel. The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful". Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama Uprising, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.|$|E

500|$|... {{consider}} another VLSI design problem: {{the question}} of whether or not to mirror-reverse each module in a circuit design. This mirror reversal leaves the module's operations unchanged, but it changes the order of the points at which the input and output signals of the module connect to it, possibly changing how well the module fits into the rest of the design. Boros et al. consider a simplified version of the problem in which the modules have already been placed along a single linear channel, in which the wires between modules must be routed, and there is a fixed bound on the density of the channel (the maximum number of signals that must pass through any cross-section of the channel). They observe that this version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance, in which the constraints relate the orientations of pairs of modules that are directly across the channel from each other. As a consequence, the optimal density may also be calculated efficiently, by performing a binary search in which each step involves the solution of a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E

2500|$|Despite similar neural {{areas and}} {{evidence}} from experiments, some scholars remain cautious about comparisons to human episodic memory (Suddendorf & Busby, 2003). Purported episodic-like memory often seems fixed {{to a particular}} domain or could be {{explained in terms of}} procedural or semantic memory. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> be better tractable by studying episodic memory's adaptive counterpart: the capacity to flexibly imagine future events. However, a recent experiment addressed one of Suddendorf and Busby (2003)'s specific criticisms (the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis, which states that nonhuman animals can only take actions based on immediate needs, as opposed to future needs). Correia and colleagues demonstrated [...] that western scrub-jays can selectively cache different types of foods depending on which type of food they will desire at a future time, offering strong evidence against the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis by demonstrating that scrub-jays can flexibly adjust their behavior based on past experience of desiring a particular food. Similarities and differences between humans and other animals are currently much debated.|$|E
