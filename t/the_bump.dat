25|$|Speed bumps vary in length, but it {{is typical}} to leave space between <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> and either edge of an {{enclosed}} road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage. Spaces on either side may also allow more expedient passage for emergency vehicles, though effectiveness {{will depend on the}} type of vehicle and specific road design.|$|E
25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} relief valve that determines {{the speed of a}} vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large bump in the ear; <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E

40|$|Formation of {{bumps in}} chalcogenide phase change thin films during the laser writing process is {{theoretically}} and experimentally investigated. The process involves basically fast heating and quenching stages. Circular bumps are formed after cooling, {{and the shape}} and size of <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> depend on various parameters such as temperatures, laser power, beam size, laser pulse duration, etc. In extreme cases, holes are formed {{at the apex of}} <b>the</b> <b>bumps.</b> To understand <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> and their formation is of great interest for data storage. In the present work, a theoretical model is established for the formation process, and the geometric characters of <b>the</b> formed <b>bumps</b> can be analytically and quantitatively evaluated from various parameters involved in the formation. Simulations based on the analytic solution are carried out taking Ag 8 In 14 Sb 55 Te 23 as an example. The results are verified with experimental observations of <b>the</b> <b>bumps.</b> (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Brandt {{was already}} {{familiar}} with the legend of a unicorn among the Tatars of Siberia with a horn so large it required a sledge for transport, and made the connection in interpreting <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> as {{the base of a}} horn. He also interpreted the rostrum of the upper mandible as the basis of a nasal horn, a hypothesis now rejected in favour of the cropping labia. In any case, the non-circular base indicates a section through the horn would not have been circular. This possibility is supported by another fossil with a non-circular partially healed puncture wound in the base, chiefly interpreted as the result of dueling other males with the horn.|$|E
25|$|The {{other basic}} {{defensive}} play is called <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> or ride-off. It's {{similar to a}} body check in hockey. In a ride-off, a player rides his pony alongside an opponent's mount {{in order to move}} an opponent away from the ball or to take him out of a play. It must be executed properly so that it does not endanger the horses or the players. The angle of contact must be safe and can not knock the horses off balance, or harm the horses in any way. Two players following the line of the ball and riding one another off have the right of way over a single man coming from any direction.|$|E
40|$|Coal {{mines in}} {{southern}} West Virginia, south-western Virginia and eastern Kentucky have experienced coal bumps {{at least since}} 1933. Most of <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> have occurred due to high cover, strong roof and floor strata and stress concentrations due to the mining sequence. A longwall mine in eastern Kentucky first experienced coal <b>bumps</b> on <b>the</b> tailgate side of the longwall face in 1989. <b>The</b> <b>bumps</b> continued until 1996. <b>The</b> <b>bumps</b> were <b>the</b> result of: • thick overburden up to 670 m. • strong roof and floor (strata strengths up to 177 MPa UCS and elasticity modulus up to 33. 1 MPa • previous over-mining in places • sandstone channels Not all characteristics occurred simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>bumps</b> produced seismic events recorded up to 4. 3 (Richter scale magnitude), and damaged pillars that were up to 45 by 46 m in size. During the eight years that <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> occurred, a large quantity of data was obtained {{in an effort to}} develop methods to predict an event, and reduce or eliminate <b>the</b> <b>bumps.</b> • In-situ strength properties of floor, coal and roof strata • Lab testing of floor, coal and roof samples • Monitoring gate road pillar response with stress metres, extensometers and convergence stations • Shield leg response • Monitoring in an effort to determine precursors was conducted using a digital microseismic monitoring system. • Back calculation of gate road pillar strength A number of different remedies were trialled in an effort to eliminate or decrease the severity of <b>the</b> <b>bumps.</b> • <b>The</b> gate road longwall design was varied • Pillar size and shape • 3 and 4 entry gate road designs • water infusion in longwall panels, • hydraulic induced face bumps, • disruption of the roof strata A yield-abutment-yield pillar design was the most effective method in reducing <b>the</b> affect of <b>bumps</b> by moving <b>the</b> events onto the abutment pillars, but <b>the</b> <b>bumps</b> were never eliminated and adequate precursors and advanced warnings were never achieved...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of Oxford college rowing, these two colleges were the only crews competing, and were joined shortly {{thereafter}} by Christ Church and Exeter. Students would row to the inn at Sandford-on-Thames, a few miles south of Oxford, and race each other on the way back. The races would start at Iffley Lock and finish at King's Barge, off Christ Church Meadow. Flags hoisted on the barge would indicate the finishing order of the crews. Crews would set off one behind the other, the trailing boat(s) trying to catch, or [...] "bump", the boat ahead. <b>The</b> <b>bumped</b> boat and <b>the</b> <b>bumping</b> boat would then drop out and <b>the</b> <b>bumping</b> boat would start the next day's race ahead of <b>the</b> <b>bumped</b> boat. <b>The</b> aim was to become the lead boat, known as Head of the River.|$|R
25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within <b>the</b> <b>bump.</b> Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are encouraged to develop a sense of self that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have memories that cast the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E

25|$|Although speed bumps are {{effective}} in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial—as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle (often found in private car parks) can be disruptive for drivers, and {{may be difficult to}} navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost $50–200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.|$|E

25|$|Disco is {{a musical}} style {{originating}} in the early 1970s that remained urban and largely underground {{until the middle of}} the decade when it began to emerge from America's urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques, and began making regular appearances mainstream, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco {{can be seen as a}} reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Disco was popular with both men and women from many different backgrounds, with dances including <b>the</b> <b>Bump</b> and the Hustle.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound {{is the size of}} a small horse and appears from the depths of Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was in the sitting room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from <b>the</b> <b>Bump.</b>|$|E
25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, {{there is a}} way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E

500|$|The current {{formulation}} of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus. The vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution. The needle {{is used to}} prick the skin (usually the upper arm) {{a number of times}} in a few seconds. If successful, a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days. In the first week, <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> becomes a large blister (called a [...] "Jennerian vesicle") which fills with pus, and begins to drain. During the second week, the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms. The scab falls off in the third week, leaving a small scar.|$|E
500|$|The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the {{director}} of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust.
