25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which {{take into account the}} rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E

Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel (David Boreanaz), the heroic vampire from America's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that [...] "Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of <b>the</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two characters." [...] Jack has also been compared to the title character of America's , which featured lesbian subtext between Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her close friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). Polina Skibinskaya, writing for AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, notes both are [...] "complex characters" [...] haunted by their past misdeeds. Furthermore, like Xena, Jack is [...] "a gay basher’s worst nightmare: a queer weapon-wielding, ass-kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes". One academic article refers to Jack as [...] "an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure". In a comparative contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within Doctor Who as [...] " [...] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan". [...] Whereas in the classic series the female [...] "companions" [...] were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to [...] "look at good looking men". John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this.|$|E
