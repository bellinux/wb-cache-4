50|$|Crash to desktop bugs are {{considered}} particularly problematic for users. Since they frequently display no error message, {{it can be}} very difficult to <b>track</b> <b>down</b> the source of the problem, especially if the times they occur and the actions taking place right before the crash do not appear to have any pattern or common ground. One way to <b>track</b> <b>down</b> the source of the problem for games is to run them in windowed-mode. Windows Vista has a feature that can help <b>track</b> <b>down</b> the cause of a CTD problem when it occurs on any program. Windows XP included a similar feature as well.|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey.

They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E

5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover <b>tracking</b> <b>down</b> the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, <b>tracking</b> <b>down</b> remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
