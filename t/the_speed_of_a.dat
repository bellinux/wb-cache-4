5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , which is about <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human sprinter.

5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the stress condition in elements of steel structures with the method of acoustic tensometry is discussed in the paper. The paper examines {{the establishment of the}} dependence of the influence of the stress condition on the relative variation in <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic wave applied to the elements of steel beam structures. It was offered to use a new approach to the implementation of acoustic nondestructive testing for the diagnosis of the stress condition of supporting structures of plant facilities. The impact of external conditions on variations in <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic signal was evaluated. Analytical dependence of the effect of the stress condition of the metal on the relative variation in <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic signal for elements of steel beam structures working in bending was derived. The acoustoelastic coupling coefficient for the relative variation in <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic wave from the stress condition of the metal in elements of steel structures have been derived from the experiments. The devised method was implemented using an angular scanning test for shelves and <b>a</b> wall <b>of</b> the element <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steel beam structure. This method allows to determine the actual stress in the elements of beam steel structures of plant facilities without relieving a structure. ? ????? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????????????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ??? ????????????. ? ????????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??? ????? ???????????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ???????????. ????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ?? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????. ? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????????? ?? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ? ????? ???????????. ? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ????????????? ?? ??????????? ????? ??????? ?????. ????????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ???????????...|$|R
