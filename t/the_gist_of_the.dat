The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E

This study used fine-grained content analysis to investigate <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> recall of two central story elements: <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> and detail <b>of</b> socially-relevant stories. Younger (M age = 28. 06) and older (M age = 75. 03) American men and women (N = 63) recalled fictional stories that were coded for (i) accuracy <b>of</b> overall <b>gist</b> and specific gist categories and (ii) accuracy of overall detail and specific detail categories. Findings showed no age group differences in accuracy <b>of</b> overall <b>gist</b> or detail, but differences emerged for specific categories. Older adults more accurately recalled <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> when <b>the</b> event occurred whereas younger adults more accurately recalled <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> why <b>the</b> event occurred. These differences were related to episodic memory ability and education. For accuracy in recalling details, there were some age differences, but gender differences were more robust. Overall, women remembered details of these social stories more accurately than men, particularly time and perceptual details. Women {{were also more likely}} to accurately remember <b>the</b> <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> when <b>the</b> event occurred.
