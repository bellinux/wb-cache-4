5|$|Kershaw pitched 18 innings {{during his}} second trip to Jacksonville (two starts and one seven inning relief appearance), winning two games. During <b>this</b> <b>stretch,</b> he allowed only two earned runs, {{lowering}} his ERA to 1.91. He was recalled on July 22.|$|E
5|$|As the Interstate was completed, the {{highways}} that it replaced {{were removed from}} the state highway system. In 1973, the SR84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US80 designation was removed from <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> in favor of I-8.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the technique of}} conserving energy in 3 G cellular systems by allowing calls between a mobile and the base station to be forwarded by some other mobile in the cell. <b>This</b> <b>stretched</b> call has the benefit of reducing overall energy cost for the call {{in cases where the}} calling mobile is NLOS (Non Line of Sight) to the base station but is LOS to the intermediary and the intermediary is LOS to the base station. The main contributions of the paper are twofold: first, we show how <b>this</b> <b>stretched</b> call model can be implemented in UMTS and CDMA 2000; second, we show that <b>this</b> <b>stretched</b> call model results in overall energy savings in a cell of between 2 x and 7 x. # I...|$|R

5|$|Cain went 4â€“1 {{over his}} next five starts. <b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> was bolstered {{in part by}} a power surge at the plate by Cain himself. He hit his first and second career home runs in these starts, off Tim Redding of the Washington Nationals and Cubs' ace Carlos Zambrano. In September, he had an 03 record.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns sharply {{west and}} then back south, then shortly after, is forced into a concrete-lined box culvert that carries it through {{downtown}} Laguna Beach (<b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> {{is also known as}} Broadway Creek.) It then is diverted completely underground and its channel winds to an outfall at Main Beach, {{one of the most popular}} beaches in Laguna Beach.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} eastward, serving residential developments, commercial outlets, and John Paul Stevens High School. It intersects with SH151, where development {{once again}} becomes patchy. The most notable development along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> of Potranco is a National Security Agency data center. State maintenance ends at an intersection with FM3487 (Culebra Road), slightly west of Interstate410 (I-410). Potranco Road continues {{as a city}} street until Ingram Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Woolhampton and the canal {{settlement}} of Aldermaston Wharf {{are the only}} significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> is Garston Lock, the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{traffic lights}} on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, which are used to {{indicate}} {{the state of the}} river in times of flood. Green indicates that flows are low or normal, and boats can proceed along <b>this</b> <b>stretch.</b> Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates that flows are very high and boats must not use the section.|$|E
5|$|A large {{interchange}} {{near the}} Naval Weapons Station Earle serves Industrial Way West, County Route 547 (Wyckoff Road), New Jersey Route 36, Hope Road, the Garden State Parkway, the Tinton Falls interchange (exit 105), and County Route 38 (Wayside Road). The route continues northwestward into Colts Neck. The freeway continues {{to the northwest}} through wooded land for several miles, crossing over Normandy Road and {{to the south of}} the Pebble Creek Golf Club. Exits along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> include New Jersey Route 34, County Route 537 (Colts Neck Road), New Jersey Route 79 (South Main Street), County Route 520, and County Route 3 (Tennent Road), which connects to Freehold Borough and Marlboro.|$|E

5|$|A leat from <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> {{was created}} at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along <b>this</b> <b>stretch.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

5|$|Although most of NY37 in {{the town}} of Bombay is {{contained}} within the reservation, a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits. Within <b>this</b> <b>stretch,</b> NY37 meets both the eastern end of NY37C and the northern terminus of NY95. East of the reservation, NY37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY970T), a connector to Quebec Route132 on the northern side of the Canadian border.|$|E
5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Downtown, {{maintenance}} of NY10 shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the village}} at Mohawk Street. The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to Incinerator Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During <b>this</b> <b>stretch,</b> NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of Incinerator Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at {{the midpoint of the}} Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into the largely rural town of Palatine.|$|E

5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road numbers that {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length of}} DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road numbers that reflect former route designations; an example is the section of US 9 between Laurel and Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> of road.|$|E
5|$|NY286 {{begins at}} the ramp {{connecting}} NY590 southbound to Browncroft Boulevard just inside the Rochester city limits. It heads east through residential surroundings as a four-lane highway, proceeding through the remainder of NY590 exit7 as it enters the northernmost portion {{of the town of}} Brighton. East of NY590, NY286 widens to become a divided highway. It passes into Penfield upon crossing Irondequoit Creek and curves southeast as it straddles the northern boundary of Ellison Park. During <b>this</b> <b>stretch,</b> it intersects with Old Browncroft Boulevard, the pre-divided highway alignment of Browncroft Boulevard which is now discontinuous near its midpoint.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY352 (Denison Parkway) in the Steuben County city of Corning. It initially heads north on Cedar Street, following it past two largely commercial blocks {{that make up}} part of the Market Street Historic District. Past the district, the route changes names to Centerway and crosses over the Chemung River, which flows eastâ€“west {{through the center of}} Corning. Across the river, the route traverses more commercial neighborhoods to reach Pulteney Street, designated as NY415 west of this point. Along <b>this</b> <b>stretch,</b> NY414 passes the former Corning Armory and the Corning Museum of Glass, the latter located on the southwest corner of the junction with NY415.|$|E
