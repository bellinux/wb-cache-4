40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of activated carbon in decreasing the peroxide levels and purification colors on used <b>cooking</b> oil. <b>The</b> need of <b>cooking</b> oil is increase. Because of <b>the</b> price of <b>cooking</b> oil is relative expensive and {{the urgency of}} economic, unwittingly, people often consume <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil that contains high levels of peroxide continuously. Activated carbon is an adsorbent {{that is used to}} process <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil. <b>The</b> purpose of this research is to determine {{effectiveness of}} activated carbon in decreasing peroxide levels in <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil. <b>The</b> type of research is Quasy Experiment with Pre and Post Test Design. <b>The</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil as control was not given the activated carbon and the other mixed 1 gr, 2 gr and 3 gr of the activated carbon into every 100 grams used cooking oil. Each done three times. The result of research showed that peroxide levels of <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil without being mixed the activated carbon is 12, 0 meq/kg with the yellow brown color. Peroxide levels of each activated carbon 1 gr, 2 gr, and 3 gr were 5, 4 meq/kg, 1, 1 meq/kg, and 1, 2 meq/kg with the yellow golden color, while according to Departemen Perindustrian SNI 3741 - 1995, the peroxide levels that permitted is 2 meq/kg. Based of Anova One-Way, the result showed there were significant differences between various treatment of the activated carbon to decrease peroxide levels in <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil. BNT test result showed that 2 gr activated carbon is the most effective to decrease peroxide levels in <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil. Suggested to the people especially to fried merchant or for another food that is processed using cooking oil as an intermediary, to use 2 gr activated carbon to every 100 grams <b>the</b> used <b>cooking</b> oil...|$|R

5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and <b>the</b> <b>cooking</b> pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and <b>the</b> <b>cooking</b> was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor rooms of the Jewel Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E

The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering <b>the</b> <b>cooking</b> temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through <b>the</b> <b>cooking</b> procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
