5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> a child's to its knees. The tunics {{of poor people}} and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
60|$|She laughed scornfully. She {{had risen}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> now, <b>and</b> he was perforce {{compelled}} <b>to</b> follow <b>her</b> example.|$|R
60|$|She rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Smaller <b>and</b> frailer {{than ever}} she seemed, {{as she stood}} before Ray, dark and massive.|$|R
60|$|She shuddered. Then {{she rose}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{straight}} <b>and</b> splendid, {{with all the}} grace of her beautiful young womanhood.|$|R
500|$|Running {{for nearly}} twelve minutes, the video {{features}} four songs from Artpop and features the central video for [...] "G.U.Y." [...] The video opens with corporate business men {{fighting each other}} over money. Nearby, a fallen angel (played by Gaga) has been {{shot out of the}} sky with an arrow. The instrumental of her song [...] "Artpop" [...] plays in the background. The men run off and Gaga crawls to safety, removing the arrow from her chest. Gaga makes it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> travels to a palace, where she collapses at the front door and is scraped up by the guards. [...] "Venus" [...] begins as she is carried down to the pool, where people cover her in flowers and put her into the water in order to heal her.|$|E
2500|$|Kane helps {{his bride}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> they embrace. [...] As the townspeople emerge and cluster around him, Kane surveys them with bitter contempt, wordlessly throws his marshal's {{star in the}} dirt, and departs with Amy on their wagon.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{few moments}} she would swoon, having no strength. [...] Then she would be {{instantly}} filled with superhuman strength, sometimes rising <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> walking about the room. She frequently moved hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, {{it could not be}} hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person. [...] In 1845, the 80-pound White held her parents' 18.5-pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour.|$|E
6000|$|O Arthur's ta'en a bugle-horn, [...] And blawn a blast sae shrill; [...] Sweet Willie started <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> [...] <b>And</b> ran {{him quickly}} till.|$|R
60|$|Katharine rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> tone <b>and</b> {{expression}} were impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|The girl rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> submissively, <b>and</b> he now saw her face, which, in the {{dim light}} that burnt in the corridor, he had not {{hitherto}} noticed.|$|R

2500|$|The quartet’s {{configuration}} was unusual, {{particularly for}} its day. Being, {{in the words}} of one 1917 article, [...] "about the only string quartet in existence" [...] to [...] "honor" [...] a female with the first violinist's chair in an otherwise entirely male ensemble, it drew public attention, as when, after a concert in Quebec, a suffragette leapt <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> cried, [...] "I never thought I'd live to see it, but it comes to pass—one woman leading three men. Votes for women!" [...] Moreover, the founder and most senior member, both by age and experience, served as violist. All three of the quartet's junior members studied first with their father before continuing studies in Brussels.|$|E
2500|$|Fergus {{tried to}} get the 'Maol' cow to rise and walk but she refused to get up. [...] His men {{believed}} that the Maol was in grief and sorrow due to the death of her Master. [...] Fergus lost his temper then and prodded the Maol with his sword. [...] When she still refused to get up, he beat her nine rhythmic blows across her back. [...] She bellowed and lowed so loudly that her agonies could be heard for many miles around. [...] Still the cow did not get up on her feet. [...] Bricne came then and said that he could make the 'Maol' get up if he got enough gifts and payment in return for that favour. [...] Fergus agreed to that and the Maol rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> led the captured herds away from Erris on the long journey towards Cruachan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Half-breed, {{have you}} even {{forgotten}} how to shoot?" [...] she called, springing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> again <b>and</b> mocking him. Then the voice of Sigwe broke in, for his anger was deep.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{had risen}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> now, <b>and</b> was looking earnestly at Chebron, then <b>her</b> eyes turned <b>to</b> {{the faces of}} Amuba and Jethro, and then slowly went back again to Chebron.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come in,' {{said the}} Groac'h, rising <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> 'Strangers <b>and</b> {{handsome}} youths are always welcome here. Do not be shy, {{but tell me}} how you found your way, and what you want.' ...|$|R
2500|$|After Lucheni struck her, the empress collapsed. A coach driver {{helped her}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> alerted the Austrian {{concierge}} of the Beau-Rivage, {{a man named}} Planner, who had been watching the empress's progress toward the Genève. The two women walked roughly [...] to the gangway and boarded, at which point Sztáray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth's arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Sztáray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat’s captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth's identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Sztáray opened her gown, cut Elisabeth's corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and Sztáray {{asked her if she}} was in pain, and she replied, [...] "No". She then asked, [...] "What has happened?" [...] and lost consciousness again.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, he lured 21-year-old Theresa Wait Ferguson {{away from}} the Merritt Square Mall in Merritt Island, Florida and murdered her, dumping her body at Canaveral Groves, where it was {{discovered}} on March 23. His next victim was 19-year-old Linda Grover from Florida State University, whom he abducted from the Governor's Square Mall in Tallahassee, Florida, and transported to Bainbridge, Georgia, on March 20. She had declined his offer to photograph her for a modeling agency, after which he assaulted her in the mall parking lot, bound her hands, wrapped her in a blanket, {{and put her in}} the trunk of his car. That night, in room 30 of the Glen Oaks Motel, he raped her, and then used a blow dryer and super glue to blind her. He [...] tortured her further by applying copper wires <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> passing an electric current through them. When she tried to get away, he beat her, but she escaped and locked herself in the bathroom where she began pounding on the walls. Wilder fled in his car, taking all of her belongings with him.|$|E
60|$|She started <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> {{stared at}} him with bewildered eyes.|$|E
60|$|As she spoke, very slowly, {{so slowly}} {{that they could}} {{scarcely}} see her move, she glided from the throne, and standing before them, began <b>to</b> move <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> body, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> chant a song.|$|R
60|$|Now Rachel rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> again <b>and</b> laughed, {{but it was}} not the mad {{laughter}} {{that had}} scared Ishmael and the Zulus; it was her own laughter, that of a healthy, cultured woman.|$|R
60|$|Con. Then go-- Entangled in the Magdalen's tresses lie; Dream {{hours before}} her picture, till thy lips Dare <b>to</b> {{approach}} <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> thou shalt start To find the canvas warm with life, and matter A moment transubstantiate to heaven.|$|R
60|$|Marie {{had risen}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> {{gazed at him}} with frightened eyes.|$|E

60|$|She rose at once <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> {{swept her}} cloak haughtily around her.|$|E
6000|$|Just then a visitor's knock sounded loud at the door, <b>and</b> {{she started}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> white <b>and</b> {{trembling}} with agitation. [...] "Oh, my God! he has come-- he has guessed!" [...] she exclaimed, pressing {{her hand on}} her throbbing breast.|$|R
6000|$|... [He goes hastily. MRS. GWYN sits drawing {{circles on}} the ground [...] with her charming parasol. Suddenly she springs <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> [...] <b>and</b> stands waiting like an animal at bay. The COLONEL and MRS. [...] HOPE {{approach}} her talking.] ...|$|R

60|$|She {{had risen}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> was looking {{straight}} {{into my eyes}} with level gaze.|$|E
60|$|But {{eventually}} {{she was able}} <b>to</b> gain <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> stagger a few steps by supporting herself with one hand upon the wall. Her captors now watched her with increasing interest. The day was approaching, and the victim was gaining in strength.|$|R
60|$|The flower on {{her bosom}} {{rose and fell}} {{somewhat}} more than usual as she added, 'I am going away now--I will leave you here.' Without waiting for a reply she adroitly swept back <b>her</b> skirts <b>to</b> free <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> {{went out of the}} church blushing.|$|R
