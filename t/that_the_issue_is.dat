5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, there is no indication <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such {{a small percentage of the}} electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
25|$|Howard (1919) {{ended his}} review by stating, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} beclouded {{by reason of}} the {{different points of view}} involved. The cost accountant wishes, among other things, to furnish the selling department adequate data upon which to base a price policy. The general accountant has in mind the preparation of correct, unpadded statements of condition and of operation. For the purposes of the one certain information is needed, which by the other should be discarded. Reconciliation of the opposing ideas ought to be possible, perhaps along the lines suggested by Messrs. Nicholson and Rohrbach.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{and studies}} {{find that there}} are no {{differences}} in the parenting of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children. These conclusions have been accepted, adopted and ratified by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatry Association, the American Pediatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America and the National Association of Social Workers. As a result, based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, this Court is satisfied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.|$|E
50|$|In September 1997, {{the talks}} broke {{down over the}} {{structure}} of {{how to deal with}} <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of Kashmir, and peace and security. Pakistan advocated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>be</b> treated by separate working groups. India responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two <b>issues</b> <b>be</b> taken up along with six others on a simultaneous basis.|$|R
25|$|Following the vote, Harper {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> now {{settled and}} that his government would not revisit the matter even if it won a majority government in the next election, held October 14, 2008.|$|R

25|$|On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) {{decided that}} the Commonwealth could not deny {{marriage}} rights to gay couples under the state constitution. On February 4, 2004, the SJC followed that ruling with {{a statement saying that}} allegedly separate but equal civil unions, implemented as of late in Vermont, would not pass constitutional muster and that only full gay marriage rights met constitutional guarantees. On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents of gay marriage subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to gay couples. It was necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, and to receive majority support in a popular referendum. It passed the first legislative session, but was defeated in the second session, receiving less than 1/4 of the votes of the legislators present. As public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> settled in Massachusetts.|$|E

500|$|Defenders of {{the current}} usage often state their {{intention}} to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders {{of the status quo}} also state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than [...] "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Although there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.|$|E
2500|$|However, on June 7, 2015, Tory {{called for}} an end to the {{practice}} of carding, stating it had [...] "eroded the public trust" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> among [...] "the most personally agonizing" [...] during his tenure as mayor.|$|R
50|$|Douglas wrote {{separately}} {{to explain}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> degree of injury to Sherbert, but South Carolina's denial of unemployment {{on the basis}} of her beliefs. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> not individual action, but government action, and under what basis government could deny someone benefits.|$|R
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about {{the omission of}} the father's name from the birth certificate, Hunter's attorney stated, [...] "A lot of women do that", and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a personal matter" [...] between Hunter and Young, before declining to comment further.|$|R
2500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Douglas Trumbull {{stated that he}} doesn't know Deckard's true nature and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> an enigma; similarly, Villeneuve also noted that in 2049, [...] "Deckard [...] is unsure, as we are, of what his identity is".|$|E
2500|$|Harper {{has said}} that he {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "niche topic", and that [...] "ordinary Canadians" [...] are not particularly concerned with the issue. A group of Canadian performers, which included Art Hindle, Wendy Crewson and Gordon Pinsent, held a press conference on September 24, saying the cuts would cripple the Canadian arts industry.|$|E
2500|$|Philippines (Vote: For): In {{the days}} before the vote, the Philippines' {{representative}} General Carlos P. Romulo stated [...] "We hold <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> primarily moral. The issue is whether the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine. The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility". After a phone call from Washington, the representative was recalled and the Philippines' vote changed.|$|E
50|$|H. F. Helmolt argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> not so {{much the}} debt per se, but the way the debt was refracted through the lens of Enlightenment {{principles}} and the increasing power of third-estate creditors, that is, commoners who held the government's paper.|$|R

2500|$|Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Death Penalty Information Center, Reprieve, {{and other}} antideath-penalty groups have not {{proposed}} a lethal-injection protocol which {{they believe is}} less painful. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that the lack of an alternative proposed protocol is testament {{to the fact that the}} painfulness of the lethal injection protocol is not the issue. Instead, supporters [...] argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the continued existence of the death penalty, since if the only issue [...] the painfulness of the procedure, then Amnesty International, HRW, or the DPIC should have already proposed a less painful method.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} a Federal Cabinet minister, Prentice {{received}} criticism that he was sidestepping the issue of Canada's net neutrality laws by not providing clear answers regarding the government's position on internet throttling practices by national Internet Service Providers (ISPs). New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus raised the issue to Prentice in the House of Commons and said the government's [...] "hands off" [...] approach was bad for Canadian innovation. [...] Prentice said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> being appropriately handled by the Federal government agency the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which invited the general public to an open debate on net neutrality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} reform {{met with}} opposition {{not because it}} would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, {{but because of the}} impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much {{power in the hands of}} the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. [...] Lord Patten of Barnes has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance it will be more difficult to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "whether there has to be change, but what kind of change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Official Turkish {{response}} was highly critical with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stating, “We regard the statement concerning the 1914* events as {{an interpretation of}} history that {{does not reflect the}} truth and is thus unacceptable. We are saddened <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> being persistently exploited and many politicians are trying to win votes out of the controversy over the 1915 events. Turkey is not a country that can be flattered and then fooled.” Whilst Turkish President Abdullah Gül claimed, “Hundreds of thousand of Turks and Muslims also died in 1915. Everyone’s pain must be shared.” Although no official complaint was lodged US Ambassador to Turkey James Jeffrey was summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry the day after the statement, where officials expressed “views, comments, assessments, as well as the reaction.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{does not}} believe the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks were a {{government}} conspiracy and has explicitly denied being a 9/11 [...] "truther", arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not a conspiracy but a failure of bureaucracy. He believes the 9/11 Commission Report's main goal was [...] "to protect the government and to protect their ineptness—not [...] to do this so they can use this {{as an excuse to}} spread the war [...] Some who did want to spread the war would use it as an opportunity. But, it wasn't something that was deliberately done." [...] He does not think the government would have staged such an attack. When asked whether [...] "9/11 was orchestrated by the government", Paul responded, [...] "Absolutely not." [...] Paul has stated that he is concerned that someone might create a [...] "contrived Gulf of Tonkin-type incident" [...] to justify the invasion of Iran or suspend the democratic process, adding, [...] "Let's hope I'm wrong about this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{same-sex}} marriage advocates declared that {{same-sex marriage}} would pass the Senate {{by the end}} of June 2009, the bill was not debated and voted upon until December of that year. On December 2, 2009, same-sex marriage legislation was defeated {{on the floor of the}} New York State Senate by a vote of 24 to 38; no Republican voted yes, eight Democrats voted no. The Daily News described the defeat as a [...] "major blow", while The New York Times stated that the defeat [...] "all but ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> dead in New York until at least 2011, when a new Legislature will be installed." [...] Elected officials and observers opined that the results of a 2009 special election in New York's 23rd Congressional District — in which a Republican candidate who had voted for same-sex marriage withdrew her candidacy in the face of a challenge from a Conservative Party candidate — affected the marriage vote in the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Forrest also {{rejected}} the US government's position that federal courts should provide habeas corpus, rather than judicial, review to military detainees as [...] "without merit" [...] and [...] "dangerous". The government argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not the court's business and that courts could consider individual habeas corpus petitions from prisoners {{who have been}} detained. [...] "That argument is without merit and, indeed, dangerous," [...] wrote Judge Forrest. [...] "Habeas petitions (which take years to be resolved following initial detention) are reviewed under a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard (versus the criminal standard of `beyond a reasonable doubt') by a single judge in a civil proceeding, not a jury of twelve citizens in a criminal proceeding which can only return a guilty verdict if unanimous." [...] "If only habeas review is available to those detained…even U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, core constitutional rights available in criminal matters would simply be eliminated," [...] she wrote. [...] "No court can accept this proposition and adhere truthfully to its oath." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, [...] "right-wing" [...] is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} laissez-faire capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism {{can be traced to}} the late 19th century. The so-called neoliberal Right, popularized by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity. Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralized economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked. Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism [...] "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations". Gregory holds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> not right or left, but [...] "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal".|$|E
