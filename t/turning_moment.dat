25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger <b>turning</b> <b>moment</b> arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E

Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: [...] Simplifying slightly, [...] the quantity [...] is the particle's moment of inertia, sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.|$|E

2500|$|With a [...] engine, Pearse's design had an {{adequate}} power-to-weight ratio to become airborne (even without an aerofoil). He continued {{to develop the}} ability to achieve fully controlled flight. Pearse incorporated small [...] "ailerons". Diagrams and eyewitness recollections agree that Pearse placed controls for pitch and yaw at {{the trailing edge of}} the low-aspect-ratio kite-type permanently stalled wing. This control placement (located in turbulent air-flow, and close to the centre of gravity) would have had minimal, possibly inadequate, <b>turning</b> <b>moment</b> to control the pitch or yaw of the aircraft. The Wright brothers, in comparison, successfully applied the principles of airfoil wing-profile and three-axis control to produce fully controlled flight.|$|E

[...] "This weapon was {{the prototype of}} all successful automatic rifles. Characteristically (and unlike previous rifles and the M-14) it had a straight stock with the barrel under the gas cylinder to reduce the <b>turning</b> <b>moment</b> of recoil of the rifle in the shoulder and thus help reduce the tendency of shots to climb in automatic fire. The barrel and overall length were shorter than a traditional rifle {{and it had a}} pistol grip to hold the weapon more securely in automatic fire. The principle of this weapon—the reduction of muzzle impulse to get usable automatic fire within the actual ranges of combat—was probably the most important advance in small arms since the invention of smokeless powder." ...|$|E

50|$|The gearbox of the {{yaw drive}} {{is a very}} crucial {{component}} since it is required to handle very large moments while requiring the minimal amount of maintenance and perform reliably for the whole life-span of the wind turbine (approx. 20 years).

50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (<b>turning)</b> <b>moment.</b> In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles <b>turning</b> <b>moment,</b> in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E

50|$|However, if {{the center}} of gravity is high {{relative}} to the width of the vessel, and the pontoons on one side are unable to bear the vessel's complete weight, the lateral movement of {{the center of}} buoyancy will be restricted.

At this point, the righting force will disappear, replaced by a <b>turning</b> <b>moment</b> in the opposite direction. This can capsize the vessel at the point at which one pontoon is completely submerged.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve the railcar/rail truck interface by developing a low maintenance bearing interface with a favorable friction coefficient. Friction and wear at the center bowl/center plate bearing interface cause high <b>turning</b> <b>moments</b> around curved track, wear of truck components, and increased detrimental dynamic effects. The recommended improvement of the rail truck interface is a set of two steel inserts, one concave and one convex, that can be retrofit to center bowls/center plates. The insert geometry addresses concerns about maintaining favorable pressure distribution on existing components, minimizing overall height increase to accommodate existing infrastructure, and retaining railcar stability. The stability of the railcar upon the design inserts has been ensured when the instantaneous center of rotation of the railcar body is above the railcar center of gravity. The damping ratio provided by the frictional moment within center bowl is 240 and eliminates the possibility of dynamic amplification. Using a 90 inch radius of curvature ensures stability and requires a 0. 5 inch diameter reduction of the existing center plate for a gap of 1 / 16 inch. The increase in railcar height for the specific design is 0. 71 inches which can be absorbed by either grinding of the center plate or new manufacturing dimensions. The design is feasible for small travel values corresponding to small vertical gaps at the side bearings. In addition to geometry alterations, the bearing surfaces are coated with a protective metallic layer. The literature suggests that optimum friction coefficients between bearing elements in the center bowl/center plate interface may reduce <b>turning</b> <b>moments</b> of the truck, wear of truck components, and detrimental dynamic effects such as hunting. Axial-torsional tests determined friction coefficient estimates and wear properties for a matrix of various metallic protective coatings and steel. Tungsten carbide-cobalt-chrome has a favorable coefficient of 0. 3 under standard center bowl/center plate contact conditions...|$|R
