5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment, as <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E

5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on the {{recommendation}} of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> are valuable today.|$|E
50|$|Following this incident, <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> toss {{rules were}} changed.

50|$|At first, <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was minted with a {{layer of}} silver alloy. During the reign of King William III of <b>the</b> Netherlands <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> became smaller from 1877 onwards.

5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> by the government.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels {{supplied}} the bullion for <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> {{at a cost}} of about $850,000. He paid $17,500 as the Mint's fee for striking <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> $2,500 for designs, and $250 for dies. A final change reduced the total value in dimes to $25,000 (250,000 coins) while increasing the value in half dollars to $350,000 (700,000 coins).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coins</b> met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency {{in a time of}} recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as backing for paper currency, and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E

25|$|They tested {{this concept}} under three {{different}} conditions. The first was person focused, where {{the person who}} tossed <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> mentioned that she was tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a <b>coin</b> focus, where <b>the</b> person who tossed <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> mentioned that <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was {{coming up with a}} lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> <b>The</b> participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> changed and <b>the</b> other where the person remained the same.|$|R
5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised the beauty of <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US coins of like value, since this meant <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> would be easier for the Mint to strike. Preston sent <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, {{to be sent to}} the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012 a hoard of 30,000 silver Roman coins, one of {{the largest}} {{discovered}} in Britain, was unearthed in an archaeological dig. <b>The</b> <b>coins,</b> believed to date from the 3rd century, were found about 150m (450ft) from the Roman baths.|$|E
5|$|In total, 757,813,744 dollars dated 1979 {{were struck}} for {{circulation}} at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints. Demand remained low through 1980, and the circulation strikes {{for that year}} totaled 89,660,708. Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage {{marked the end of}} production. At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a surplus of 520,000,000 coins in 1981. Melting <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents, and the 98 cents earned from seignorage was applied to the national debt. Had <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> been melted, their seignorage would {{have been added to the}} debt. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed.|$|E

5|$|No {{further action}} was taken until the summer of 1834, when {{officials}} suggested that proof coin sets be prepared as gifts for Asian dignitaries. After examining Mint records, personnel incorrectly concluded that the last Draped Bust dollars minted were dated 1804, so they chose that date for <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b> It is unknown why the current date was not used, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were predated to prevent coin collectors from becoming angered when they {{would be unable to}} obtain the newly dated coins, which were struck in very small numbers. It is unknown precisely how many 1804 dollars were struck, though eight are known to be extant.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E
