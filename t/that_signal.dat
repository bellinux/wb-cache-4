25|$|It is also {{possible}} to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a feed off the loop {{it would have been}} associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a center tap in the tuning inductor, and then feeding <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with aperiodic windings, the sense circuit has to be wired into the receiver side, along with the tuning capacitor.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} solitary until the mating season, which occurs {{during the rainy}} season, and can last for several months, usually from April to May. During this time, males must find females. Typically, female snakes will lay down a trail of pheromones for the males to follow, {{but it is still}} unclear how the males of this species track a female's scent. Another {{possibility}} is that the female releases an airborne stimulant. This theory is supported by the observation of females that remain motionless while many males move towards them from all directions. Male anacondas also frequently flick their tongues to sense chemicals <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> the presence of the female.|$|E

Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso, upper arms and legs; progressing over 10–12 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs.|$|E
25|$|Prairie dog {{copulation}} {{occurs in}} the burrows, and this {{reduces the risk of}} interruption by a competing male. They are also at less risk of predation. Behaviors <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> that a female is in estrus include underground consorting, self-licking of genitals, dust-bathing, and late entrances into the burrow at night. The licking of genitals may protect against sexually transmitted diseases and genital infections, while dust-bathing may protect against fleas and other parasites. Prairie dogs also have a mating call which consists of a set of 2 to 25 barks with a 3- to 15-second pause between each one. Females may try to increase their reproduction success by mating with males outside their family groups. When copulation is over, the male is no longer interested in the female sexually, but will prevent other males from mating with her by inserting copulatory plugs.|$|E

25|$|Matters {{continued}} to simmer. German {{accounts of the}} battle were published, which went some way to credit Evan-Thomas' ships {{with most of the}} success against Hipper during the battle cruiser action. Then in 1927, Winston Churchill published his own account of the war, coming down heavily on Beatty's side in the argument. This prompted Evan-Thomas, now somewhat recovered from his illness, to write to The Times, publicly stating his case. A number of newspapers carried articles criticising Beatty's connection with the official report, and its contents. In March, a staged question about Evan-Thomas' failure to close up his ships with Beatty's was asked in the House of Commons, and answered with a statement <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> logs from Barham indicated signals to change course had indeed been received, {{at least as far as}} her accompanying destroyers were concerned. Harper had now retired from the navy, and published a new version of his account (The Truth about Jutland). Beatty was coming to the end of his appointment as First Sea Lord and was due to be replaced by Jellicoe's brother in law, Sir Charles Madden, and found his last few months a time of considerable criticism. The original Harper Record was now also published. A further rebuttal against Harper, The Truth about Harper, also appeared, and many other books have been published since.|$|E
25|$|In {{multicellular}} animals {{the same}} principle has been put {{in the service of}} gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.|$|E
25|$|Assimilation of diet into tissue has a tissue-specific {{fractionation}} {{known as}} the trophic discrimination factor. Diet sources can be tracked through a food web via deuterium isotope profiles, although this is complicated by deuterium having two potential sources - water and food. Food more strongly impacts δD than does exchange with surrounding water, and <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> is seen across trophic levels. However, different organisms derive organic hydrogen in varying ratios of water to food: for example, in quail, 20-30% of organic hydrogen was from water and the remainder from food. The precise percentage of hydrogen from water was dependent on tissue source and metabolic activity. In chironomids, 31-47% of biomass hydrogen derived from water, and in microbes as much as 100% of fatty acid hydrogen {{can be derived from}} water depending on substrate. In caterpillars, diet δD from organic matter correlates linearly with tissue δD. The same relationship does not appear to hold consistently for diet δD from water, however - water derived from either the caterpillar or its prey plant is more deuterium enriched than their organic material. Going up trophic levels from prey (plant) to predator (caterpillar) results in an isotopic enrichment. This same trend of enrichment is seen in many other animals - carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores - and appears to follow 15N relative abundances. Carnivores at the same trophic level tend to exhibit the same level of 2H enrichment. Because, as mentioned earlier, the amount of organic hydrogen produced from water varies between species, a model of trophic level related to absolute fractionation is difficult to make if the participating species are not known. Consistency in measuring the same tissues is also important, as different tissues fractionate deuterium differently. In aquatic systems, tracking trophic interactions is valuable for not only understanding the ecology of the system, but also for determining the degree of terrestrial input. The patterns of deuterium enrichment consistent within trophic levels is a useful tool for assessing the nature of these interactions in the environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} Compressive Sensing (CS) theory indicates <b>that</b> robust <b>signals</b> recovery can {{be obtained}} from just a few collection of incoherent projections. To further decrease the necessary measurements, an alternative to the generic CS framework assumes <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> lie on a union of subspaces (UoS). However, UoS model is limited to the specific type of signal regularity. This paper considers a more general and adaptive model which presumes <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> lie on a union of data-driven subspaces (UoDS). The UoDS model inherits the merit from UoS <b>that</b> <b>signals</b> have structural sparse representation. Meanwhile, it allows to recover signals using fewer degrees of freedom for a desirable recovery quality than UoS. To construct the UoDS model, a subspace clustering method is utilized to form an adaptive group set. The corresponding adaptive basis is learned by applying a linear subspace learning (LSL) method to each group. A corresponding recovery algorithm with provable performance is also given. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model for video sampling is valid and applicable. ...|$|R

Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes <b>that</b> <b>signal</b> competitive breeding situations. Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual’s fitness.
