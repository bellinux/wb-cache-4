5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but <b>that</b> <b>special</b> esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the mall}} {{underwent}} some cosmetic renovation and was renamed from simply The Mall to University Mall, probably to diversify {{it from the}} new McCain Mall Simon was planning for North Little Rock. The mall's reopening was held in March of that year. News accounts say <b>that</b> <b>special</b> {{emphasis was placed on}} a security program. University Mall drew thousands of shoppers yearly and was known for its holiday displays and programs. It also became a favorite place for many walkers, including retirees and heart patients from St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center, located just across University Avenue.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact <b>that</b> <b>special</b> needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question <b>that</b> <b>special</b> publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little published on {{or in the}} Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to {{an article on the}} Kulango language containing a German-Nafaanra (Nafana-Sprache) word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing <b>that</b> <b>special</b> attention was paid to the marking of the tones.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for the West India Company, {{the infant}} colony of New Netherland languished, the {{cautious}} Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands {{in which no}} substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s {{could be considered a}} relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized <b>that</b> <b>special</b> measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable.|$|E
5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in which}} their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria <b>that</b> <b>special</b> balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
5|$|The US Department of Defense {{issued its}} Quadrennial Defense Review on 6 February 2006. In this report, the {{department}} announced <b>that</b> <b>Special</b> Operations Forces would increase {{in all areas}} across all branches of the US military. To support this, the department announced that psychological operations and civil affairs units would be increased by 3,700 soldiers to support units throughout the Army. This would include a large increase of the active component civil affairs, {{which at the time}} consisted of only the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, commanding six company sized units assigned to the major regional commands of the US Army. The decision was made to form a brigade-sized civil affairs unit to act as a command element for the only four active duty battalion sized civil affairs units operating for the active duty US Army. This move would allow the brigade to more quickly prepare its subordinate units for rapid deployment in support of Army contingencies in order to provide tactical support to other Army units. It was decided shortly thereafter that the 95th Civil Affairs Group would be reactivated.|$|E

5|$|While in {{law school}} in the late 1960s, an era of {{escalation}} in the Vietnam War, Burke received a draft deferment as a full-time student. After his marriage {{and the death of}} his father, he applied for and was granted a hardship deferment (3-A), as the sole support of his wife, mother, and two younger brothers. In June 1969, the Illinois Selective Service board of appeals reclassified him 1-A ("available for unrestricted military service"). At the same time, he was accepted into a Chicago-based United States Army Reserve unit, the 363rd civil affairs group, as a private. Political rivals expressed concern <b>that</b> <b>special</b> consideration allowed Burke to join the Reserve unit ahead of others, but an Army investigation found no evidence of manipulation in his favor.|$|E

The New Syrian Army captured the village in that month and faced regular ISIL attacks. British forces also helped rebuild the base following a suicide attack. The New Syrian Army acknowledged <b>that</b> British <b>special</b> forces had provided training, weapons and other equipment; an independent source confirmed <b>that</b> UK <b>special</b> forces are operating against Isis in Syria, Iraq and Libya.|$|R

25|$|Some criticized Special Relativity {{for various}} reasons, such {{as lack of}} {{empirical}} evidence, internal inconsistencies, rejection of mathematical physics per se, or philosophical reasons.
