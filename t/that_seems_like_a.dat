500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E

In April 2011, she {{appeared}} in a commercial for the American Red Cross asking people to pledge $10 to help those affected by the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. In the same year Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the first Annual Global Action Awards Gala for her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children in schools, and her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated: [...] "I want (kids) to do something they love. Not something <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chore because someone tells them that's {{the right thing to}} do or what their parents want or what's important to people around them, but what's in their heart." [...] In December 2011, {{she appeared in}} a commercial for the charity J/P Haitian Relief Organization, and teamed up with her elder brother Trace Cyrus to design a limited edition T-shirt and hoodie for charity. All proceeds from the sale of these items went to her charity, Get Ur Good On, which supports education for under-privileged children. In the same month, she performed her song [...] "The Climb" [...] at the CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E

60|$|Granny Fox and Reddy {{were out}} too. They didn't need to hurry because, as you know, they could hunt all night, {{but they were}} so hungry that they just had {{to be looking for}} {{something}} to eat. They knew, of course, that everybody else would be out, and they hoped that some of these little people would be so weak that they could easily be caught. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dreadful hope, doesn't it? But one of the first laws of Old Mother Nature is self-preservation. That means to save your own life first. So perhaps Granny and Reddy are not to be blamed for hoping that some of their neighbors might be caught easily because of the great storm. They were very hungry indeed, and they could not eat bark like Peter Rabbit, or buds like Mrs. Grouse, or seeds like Whitefoot the Woodmouse. Their teeth and stomachs are not made for such food.|$|E
6000|$|But when, as I have said, our {{impartiality}} {{has made}} all those qualifications and deductions against which even the greatest poet may not plead his privilege, {{what is left}} to Wordsworth is enough to justify his fame. Even where his genius is wrapped in clouds, the unconquerable lightning of imagination struggles through, flashing out unexpected vistas, and illuminating the humdrum pathway of our daily thought with a radiance of momentary consciousness <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> revelation. If it be the most delightful function of the poet to set our lives to music, yet perhaps he {{will be even more}} sure of our maturer gratitude if he do his part also as moralist and philosopher to purify and enlighten; if he define and encourage our vacillating perceptions of duty; if he piece together our fragmentary apprehensions of our own life and that larger life whose unconscious instruments we are, making of the jumbled bits of our dissected map of experience a coherent chart. In the great poets there is an exquisite sensibility both of soul and sense that sympathizes like gossamer sea-moss with every movement of the element in which it floats, but which is rooted on the solid rock of our common sympathies. Wordsworth shows less of this finer feminine fibre of organization than one or two of his contemporaries, notably than Coleridge or Shelley; but he was a masculine thinker, and in his more characteristic poems there is always a kernel of firm conclusion from far-reaching principles that stimulates thought and challenges meditation. Groping in the dark passages of life, we come upon some axiom of his, as it were a wall that gives us our bearings and enables us to find an outlet. Compared with Goethe we feel that he lacks that serene impartiality of mind which results from breadth of culture; nay, he seems narrow, insular, almost provincial. He reminds us of those saints of Dante who gather brightness by revolving on their own axis. But through this very limitation of range he gains perhaps in intensity and the impressiveness which results from eagerness of personal conviction. If we read Wordsworth through, as I have just done, we find ourselves changing our mind about him at every other page, so uneven is he. If we read our favorite poems or passages only, he will seem uniformly great. And even as regards [...] "The Excursion" [...] we should remember how few long poems will bear consecutive reading. For my part I know of but one,--the Odyssey.|$|E
