Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E

30|$|In a word, {{the current}} studies on <b>the</b> carrier <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> HG/h-BN heterobilayer {{are still not}} enough. The main factors which affect <b>the</b> carrier <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> HG/h-BN heterobilayer, namely {{hydrogen}} coverage, hydrogenation pattern and the stacking pattern between HG and h-BN, should be clarified. In this paper, <b>the</b> carrier <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> HG/h-BN heterobilayer structures were investigated based on the first-principles calculations. Firstly, {{the effect of the}} h-BN substrate on <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> HG was investigated. Secondly, the electronic properties of HG with different hydrogen coverage were compared. Finally, different hydrogenation patterns were applied in 25 % and 6.25 % HG to reveal the influence of hydrogenation pattern.|$|R

This article discusses the basic steps for development of suitable electrolytes, based on fundamental knowledge {{of the nature of the}} analytes and the proposed background electrolyte. Consideration is given to the choice of the absorbing probe used for indirect detection, based on <b>the</b> relative <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe and the analytes, and the desired limits of detection. Choice of the electro-osmotic flow modifier and correct buffering protocols are also discussed.

5|$|Frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and {{threatened}} the minesweepers sent {{to clear the}} Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet's efforts. Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Constantinople within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, {{was placed on the}} sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach {{themselves to a}} suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E

In the west, forces advanced north from Sattelberg following its capture, while in the east, an advance was made from North Hill on the coast, north of Scarlet Beach, where the Australians had landed earlier in the campaign. A smaller drive {{was made in the}} centre from Nongora, which lay in between the two, although this was limited and subsequently linked up with the coastal drive. Although possessing significant forces, the Australian advance proved slow. Heavy rain and harsh terrain slowed the Australian resupply efforts and reduced <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> their manoeuvre elements. Disease and fatigue also heavily depleted their infantry, with more casualties being suffered from illnesses than combat.|$|E
30|$|The CWAG process claims an {{improvement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WAG <b>mobility</b> ratio, M. It affects both the areal and vertical sweeps, with sweep increasing as M decreases {{for a given}} volume of fluid injected. In a CWAG process, {{there is more than}} one displacement front due to the injection of multiple slugs of different fluids such as ASP, CO 2, and water. The flow behavior of any specific displacement front is affected by <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluids immediately ahead of and behind that front and also by <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluids in the regions around the other fronts.|$|R

5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake. In addition the forest shielded both sides from visual observation. Both of these factors greatly hindered <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> artillery and vehicles in the area, providing a considerable advantage to the defending forces. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights which were some 150 metres higher than the surrounding flat terrain, which {{were some of the}} few dry and clear areas, and in addition provided good observation. Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire. The Neva River and marshes were partially frozen in winter which allowed infantry to cross it, but not heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Manco Inca had {{gathered}} more than 30,000troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, {{a large number}} of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and quilted cloth armor. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor; slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> horses.|$|E

5|$|The 1601 Act {{sought to}} deal with 'settled' poor who had found {{themselves}} temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method of relief was {{at this time in}} history seen as harsh. The act was supposed {{to deal with}} beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The Act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty made people work. In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and 'vagrants'. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately the laws reduced <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> labour and discouraged paupers from leaving their parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) so that an employee could not become eligible for poor relief.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> water in living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
