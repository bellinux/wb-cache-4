50|$|The {{original}} Evans balance {{was described}} by Dennis F. Evans in 1973 based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Evans used Ticonal bars with cadmium plated mild steel yokes as the magnets, a Johnson-Matthey gold alloy (hence the other name of the balance)for the suspension strip, all glued together with epoxy resin onto a phosphor brown spacer. The tubes were made from NMR tubes and the current came from CdS photocells. This original was modified {{with help from the}} Johnson-Matthey company Two pairs of magnets were glued between the arms of an H-frame. The sample was placed into the gap between one pair of magnets and a small coil in the gap between the second pair of magnets. This entire construction pivoted horizontally around a <b>torsion</b> <b>strip.</b> When a sample tube was placed between the first pair of magnets, the torsional force was restored by the current passed through the coil between the second pair of magnets, giving a reading on a display instead of a Helipot (as was used in the original).|$|E

While this review contains no new results, it includes more detailed descriptions of certain key parameters that enter into the determination of G. Following a description of the overall method and the two versions of the experiment, we discuss the properties of the <b>torsion</b> <b>strip,</b> including the effects of anelasticity, then the electrostatic torque transducer, the source and test masses, dimensional metrology, angle measurement, the calculation and measurement of the moment of inertia, calculation of the torque, possible magnetic interactions and finally we discuss uncertainties and correlations in the derivation of a value for G.

40|$|The {{safe and}} {{efficient}} construction of reinforced concrete flat plate systems requires an accurate, reliable and universally applicable procedure for the punching shear strength design. A nonlinear layered {{finite element method}} (LFEM) capable of analysing the punching shear strength of such system has been developed. Based on the LFEM, a parametric study is undertaken to evaluate some of the factors influencing punching shear strength of reinforced concrete flat palate with spandrel beams. This is done by varying the depth and {{the width of the}} spandrel beam while keeping other variables constant. The numerical results obtained by the LFEM are also compared with those predicted by the recommendations of the Australian Standard (AS 3600 - 2009) and the Wollongong-Griffith semi-empirical method. The results confirm that the Australian Standard is inadequate in predicting the punching shear strength at the corner and edge column connections of flat plates with spandrel beams or <b>torsion</b> <b>strips.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a two-way rotary shape memory alloy thin strip actuator, the {{torsional}} deformation and fatigue properties of a TiNi SMA thin strip were investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows. (1) In the SMA thin <b>strip</b> subjected to <b>torsion,</b> the MT appears {{along the edge of}} the strip due to elongation of the edge of the strip and grows to the central part. (2) The number of cycles to failure decreases with an increase in the maximum angle of twist in torsion fatigue. The fatigue life in pulsating torsion is longer than that in alternating torsion by five times. The fatigue limit exists in a certain value of dissipated work of the strip in each cycle. (3) Based on the two-way motion of a lifting actuator model driven by two kinds of SMA thin strip, it is confirmed that the two-way rotary actuator with a small and simple mechanism can be developed by using the SMA thin strips.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{reinforced}} or prestressed concrete tlat plates with spandrel beams, {{one of the most}} critical aspects that needs to be considered is the punching shear strength, Vu of the slab-column-spandrel connections. Research on this behaviour has been carried out in recent years by various engineering academics and professionals. One of the more encompassing analytical approach in determining Vu, is the procedure developed by Loo and Falamaki for reinforced concrete slab-column-spandrel connections at the edgeand corner-column positions. In th,e case of prestressed concrete tlat plates, there is as yet no reliable procedure for the determination of Vu 2 ̆ 7 particularly for the above stated slab-column-spandrel connections. Thus, the main objective of the present study is to develop an analytical procedure for the prediction of Vu, for these types of structural connections. This procedure is an extension of the analytical approach developed by Loo and Falamaki* whereby the effect of prestress is taken into account and incorporated into the appropriate equilibrium equations. The development albeit an extension of a reliable analytical method requires accurate test results from large-scale models with proper boundary conditions. Tests up to failure were carried out on four prestressed post-tensioned concrete flat plate models, two with spandrel beams of different widths and depths, while the other two have a <b>torsion</b> <b>strip</b> and a free edge respectively. These half-scale models, each weighing approximately 5 tonnes, represent two adjacent panels at the corner of a typical flat plate structure and were tested under simulated unifonnly distributed loads. For ease of construction, each of the flat plate models was supported on six concrete column sections, which were cast and rigidly connected onto prefabricated steel sections at the bottom instead of having concrete columns. Specially designed load cells were used to measure the three reaction components at the hinged base of each of the column supports. Strain gauges were also attached to the reinforcing bars and prestressed tendons of the slab. The strains and other electrical signals were logged using a Hewlett Packard 3054 A data acquisition control system via a Hewlett Packard 9826 computer. Besides the experimental work, three concurrent studies were also carried out. The first was a comparative study of the various methods of punching shear strength analysis of reinforced concrete flat plates with spandrel beams. It was found that the Wollongong Approach developed by Loo and Falamaki [1992] was superior to alternative methods including that recommended by the Australian Standard for Concrete Structures (AS 3600 - 1988). The second was a parametric study of the effect of spandrel beam on the punching shear strength analysis, using the Wollongong Approach. From this study, a range of parametric limitations were identified within which the Wollongong Approach may be applied. Finally, based on the experimental results, a theoretical study was undertaken which led to the development of a prediction procedure for the punching shear strength, Vu of post-tensioned concrete flat plates with spandrel beams, the details of which are presented herein. As with the Wollongong Approach, the proposed procedure (referred to in this thesis as the 2 ̆ 2 Modified Wollongong Approach 2 ̆ 2) is applicable to the analysis of failures at the comer- and edge-column positions. In addition to the consideration of parameters such as the overall geometry of the connection, the concrete strength and the slab restraint on the spandrel, the procedure also takes into account the following parameters: (1) the size and location of the prestressed tendons, (2) the magnitude of the applied prestress, and (3) the profiles of the draped tendons. In comparing the accuracy and reliability of the proposed analytical procedure with the Australian Standard approach, the latter was found to be less reliable in that it consistently overestimates the value of Vu 2 ̆ 7 especially at the corner-column positions. This is also consistent with the compared results of the comparative study on reinforced concrete flat plates with spandrel beams...|$|E
