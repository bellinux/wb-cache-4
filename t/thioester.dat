25|$|The {{alternative}} pathway is continuously activated {{at a low}} level, analogous to a car engine at idle, {{as a result of}} spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal <b>thioester</b> bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The {{alternative pathway}} does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal <b>thioester.</b> In contrast, when the internal <b>thioester</b> of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.|$|E
25|$|The NEDD4 protein has a modular {{structure}} that is shared among the NEDD4 family, consisting of an amino-terminal C2 calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain, 3-4 WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic HECT ubiquitin ligase domain. The C2 domain targets proteins to the phospholipid membrane, {{and can also}} be involved in targeting substrates. The WW domains interact with proline rich PPxY motifs in target proteins to mediate interactions with substrates and adaptors. The catalytic HECT domain forms a <b>thioester</b> bond with activated ubiquitin transferred from an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, before transferring ubiquitin directly to a specific substrate.|$|E

2500|$|GAPDH uses {{covalent}} catalysis {{and general}} base catalysis {{to decrease the}} very large and positive activation energy of the second step of this reaction. [...] First, a cysteine residue in the active site of GAPDH attacks the carbonyl group of GAP, creating a hemithioacetal intermediate (covalent catalysis). [...] Next, an adjacent, tightly bound molecule of NAD+ accepts a hydride ion from GAP, forming NADH; GAP is concomitantly oxidized to a <b>thioester</b> intermediate using a molecule of water. [...] This <b>thioester</b> species is much higher in energy than the carboxylic acid species {{that would result in}} the absence of GAPDH (the carboxylic acid species is so low in energy that the energy barrier for the second step of the reaction (phosphorylation) would be too high, and the reaction, therefore, too slow and equilibrium too unfavorable for a living organism). [...] Donation of the hydride ion by the hemithioacetal is facilitated by its deprotonation by a histidine residue in the enzyme's active site (general base catalysis). [...] Deprotonation encourages the reformation of the carbonyl group in the <b>thioester</b> intermediate and ejection of the hydride ion. [...] NADH leaves the active site and is replaced by another molecule of NAD+, the positive charge of which stabilizes the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen in the transition state of the next and ultimate step. [...] Finally, a molecule of inorganic phosphate attacks the <b>thioester</b> and forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses to release 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and the thiol group of the enzyme's cysteine residue.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{event in}} DXR {{synthesis}} is {{the selection of}} the propionyl-CoA starter unit and its decarboxylative addition to a two carbon ketide unit, derived from malonyl-CoA to produce the five carbon B-ketovaleryl ACP. [...] The five carbon diketide is delivered by the ACP to the cysteine sulfhydryl group at the KS active site, by <b>thioester</b> exchange, and the ACP is released from the chain. [...] The free ACP picks up another malonate group from malonyl-CoA, also by <b>thioester</b> exchange, with release of the CoA. [...] The ACP brings the new malonate to the active site of the KS where is it decarboxylated, possibly {{with the help of the}} CLF subunit, and joined to produce a 7 carbon triketide, now anchored to the ACP (see top of Figure 1). [...] Again the ACP hands the chain off to the KS subunit and the process is repeated iteratively until the decaketide is completed.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin has {{an unusual}} {{structure}} (see above figure), with two rings fused together via {{one of their}} sides. The two rings are ureido and thiophene moieties. [...] Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing monocarboxylic acid. It is made from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA via three enzymes. [...] 8-Amino-7-oxopelargonic acid synthase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzyme. The pimeloyl-CoA, could be produced by a modified fatty acid pathway involving a malonyl <b>thioester</b> as the starter. 7,8Diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) aminotransferase is unusual in using S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the NH2 donor. Dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes {{the formation of the}} ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP. Biotin synthase reductively cleaves SAM into a deoxyadenosyl radical—a first radical formed on dethiobiotin is trapped by the sulfur donor, which was found to be the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) center contained in the enzyme.|$|E

[...] It is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life. For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the [...] "open" [...] acetyl-CoA pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. There are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic thiolated and <b>Thioester</b> compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents).|$|E
2500|$|Cyclosporin is {{synthesized}} by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. The enzyme {{contains an}} adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain {{is responsible for}} substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. Cyclosporin synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a <b>thioester</b> linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine indicate cyclosporin synthetase requires the action of other enzymes such as a D-alanine racemase. The racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a butenyl-methyl-L-threonine polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material.|$|E

The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the <b>thioester</b> into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
