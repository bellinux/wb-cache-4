50|$|This {{business}} unit carries out research into friction and wear. <b>Tribological</b> systems are optimized and solutions are developed that reduce friction and protect against wear {{with the aid}} of technical ceramics, innovative lubricants, <b>tribological</b> layer systems and tribo-materials conditioned for manufacturing technology. Friction, abrasion, running-in and wear mechanisms are investigated as they affect the tribo-chemistry of machine elements such as roller and slide bearings, cutting and forming tools or motor and gear elements. Experimental techniques, multi-scale modeling and numerical simulations as well as microstructure analysis are employed.|$|E
50|$|The SFA {{has more}} {{recently}} {{been extended to}} perform dynamic measurements, thereby determining viscous and viscoelastic properties of fluids, frictional and <b>tribological</b> properties of surfaces, and the time-dependent interaction between biological structures.|$|E
50|$|As {{metal matrix}} {{composite}} (MMC) materials have become to be used more often due to their better physical, mechanical and <b>tribological</b> properties compared to matrix materials {{it is necessary to}} adjust the equation.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface is}} similar to the typical honing crosshatch, this leads to good <b>tribological</b> {{properties}} and fine roughness. The low sub surface damage will {{have a positive impact on}} subsequent polishing processes (CMP, etching).|$|E
5000|$|A tribometer is an {{instrument}} that measures <b>tribological</b> quantities, such as coefficient of friction, friction force, and wear volume, between two surfaces in contact. It was invented by the 18th century Dutch scientist Musschenbroek ...|$|E
5000|$|Finally, at the {{microscopic}} and nano-scales, contact mechanics {{is used to}} increase our understanding of <b>tribological</b> systems, e.g. investigate the origin of friction, and for the engineering of advanced devices like atomic force microscopes and MEMS devices.|$|E
50|$|Chameleon coating, {{also known}} as nano {{composite}} <b>tribological</b> coating, is an adaptive adhesive that uses nanotechnology to adjust to environmental fluctuations to make living conditions more suitable to the object that the coat has been applied to.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} high Young's moduli, their use in {{mechanically}} enhancing composites is being investigated. Because nanowires appear in bundles, they {{may be used as}} <b>tribological</b> additives to improve friction characteristics and reliability of electronic transducers and actuators.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their production, Micromy also conducts research in the Täby facility. One of the applications of their research results is a new surface layer called micronite. Compared to conventional PVD coatings, micronite has outstanding <b>tribological</b> and corrosive properties.|$|E
50|$|At high temperatures, {{the more}} rapid {{generation}} of oxide {{due to a}} combination of temperature and <b>tribological</b> action during sliding wear can generate potentially wear resistant oxide layers known as 'glazes'. Under such circumstances, tribocorrosion can be used potentially in a beneficial way.|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} {{proof of this}} was {{obtained}} using a UHV-STM to measure. If lattices are incommensurable, friction was not observed, however, if the surfaces are commensurable, friction force is present. At the atomic level, these <b>tribological</b> properties are directly connected with superlubricity.|$|E
50|$|Space {{tribology}} is {{a subset}} of the lubrication field dealing with the reliable performance of satellites and spacecraft (including the space station). It encompasses the entire gamut of <b>tribological</b> regimes, including elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), parched EHL, transient EHL, boundary lubrication, and mixed lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Because of the <b>tribological</b> {{characteristics}} of the material, it tends to harden with increasing deformation (see ductility), increasing its potential to crack. To avoid cracking, an extremely even deformation was necessary. Additionally, the material had to be softened by repeatedly heating it to a temperature of at least 750 C.|$|E
50|$|Most {{technical}} {{universities have}} researchers working on tribology, often {{as part of}} mechanical engineering departments. The limitations in <b>tribological</b> interactions are, however, no longer mainly determined by mechanical designs, but by material limitations. So the discipline of tribology now counts at least as many materials engineers, physicists and chemists as it does mechanical engineers.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to consider as many variables as possible when evaluating an ENP coating for <b>tribological</b> applications. Factors such as hardness, phosphorus content, the presence of corrosive liqiuids or gases, the temperature, the nature of the mating surface, the degree of lubrication and the characteristics of the substrate are critical to optimum performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{commercial}} {{graphitic carbon}} nitride is available under {{the brand name}} Nicanite. In its micron-sized graphitic form, {{it can be used}} for <b>tribological</b> coatings, biocompatible medical coatings, chemically inert coatings, insulators and for energy-storage solutions. Graphitc carbon nitride is reported {{as one of the best}} hydrogen storage materials. It can also be used as a support for catalytic nanoparticles.|$|E
50|$|Any product {{where one}} {{material}} slides or rubs over another {{is affected by}} complex <b>tribological</b> interactions, whether lubricated like hip implants and other artificial prostheses, or unlubricated as in high temperature sliding wear in which conventional lubricants cannot be used but in which the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes have been observed to protect against wear.|$|E
50|$|Deposit {{hardness}} {{is one of}} the key <b>tribological</b> {{properties of}} ENP coating technology. Factors that affect hardness are the film composition (%P), the heat treatment temperature and the heat treatment time. Typical microhardness values for the as plated ENP deposits range from 500 to 720 VHN (Figure 8.) This is in contrast to electrolytically deposited nickel, which have typical values of 150-400VHN.|$|E
5000|$|Biotribocorrosion {{covers the}} science of surface transformations {{resulting}} from the interactions of mechanical loading and chemical/electrochemical reactions that occur between elements of a <b>tribological</b> system exposed to biological environments. [...] It has been studied for aritificial joint prostheses. It {{is important to understand}} material degradation processes for joint implants to achieve longer service life and better safety issues for such devices.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{favorable}} <b>tribological</b> properties of DLC {{it must be}} used with caution on ferrous metals. If it is used at higher temperatures, the substrate or counter face may carburize, {{which could lead to}} loss of function due to a change in hardness. The final, end use temperature of a coated component should be kept below the temperature at which a PVC DLC coating is applied.|$|E
50|$|Like halogen treatment, vacuum {{decomposition}} is a conformal process. The resulting carbon structures are, as {{a result}} of the higher temperatures, more ordered, and carbon nanotubes and graphene can be obtained. In particular, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes films of high tube density have been reported for vacuum decomposition of SiC. The high tube density translates into a high elastic modulus and high buckling resistance which is of particular interest for mechanical and <b>tribological</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|Polyimide powder {{can be used}} {{to produce}} parts and shapes by {{sintering}} technologies (hot compression molding, direct forming, and isostatic pressing). Because of their high mechanical stability even at elevated temperatures they are used as bushings, bearings, sockets or constructive parts in demanding applications. To improve <b>tribological</b> properties compounds with solid lubricants like graphite, PTFE or molybdenum sulfide are common. Polyimide parts and shapes include P84 NT, VTEC PI, Meldin, Vespel and Plavis.|$|E
50|$|Kinetic energy {{metamorphosis}} {{products are}} <b>tribological</b> phenomena, caused by very focused, localized {{cumulative effect of}} kinetic energy on the syntaxial silica (and the voids it contains) that forms the cement of such rocks as sandstones and quartzites. The conversion to tectonite {{does not appear to}} be reversible, and the high resistance of that product to weathering processes protects the parent rock it conceals from both granular and mass exfoliation. Its susceptibility to dating techniques needs to be explored.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tribological</b> {{interactions}} {{of a solid}} surface's exposed face with interfacing materials and environment may result in loss of material from the surface. The process leading to loss of material is known as [...] "wear". Major types of wear include abrasion, friction (adhesion and cohesion), erosion, and corrosion. Wear can be minimized by modifying the surface properties of solids {{by one or more}} [...] "surface engineering" [...] processes (also called surface finishing) or by use of lubricants (for frictional or adhesive wear).|$|E
50|$|DLC {{coatings}} {{are often}} used to prevent wear due to their excellent <b>tribological</b> properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC {{is often used to}} prevent wear on razor blades and metal cutting tools, including lathe inserts and milling cutters. DLC is used in bearings, cams, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{carried out}} by Li et al. looked into {{different}} properties, such as the fracture toughness and wear resistance of Bioglass 45S5. The authors loaded graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) into the glass structure through a spark plasma sintering method. Graphene was chosen because of its high specific surface area and strength, {{as well as its}} cytocompatibility and lack of interference with Bioglass 45S5’s bioactivity. The composites that were created in this experiment achieved a fracture toughness of more than double the control. In addition, the <b>tribological</b> properties of the material were greatly improved.|$|E
