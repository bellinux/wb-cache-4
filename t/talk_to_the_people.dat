Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech.

[...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?'

There were some people who said that he had taken the position of toll-gate keeper because of the house, and there were others who believed that he had bought the house on account of the toll-gate. But no matter what people thought or said, the good captain was very well satisfied with his home and his official position.
