5|$|In total, {{there have}} been 61 {{occasions}} on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first-class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket. The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first-class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016, when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction. Brodribb {{suggests that it is}} likely that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a significant number more dismissals than {{there have been}} for handling the ball: in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission, there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal. On one such instance, the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed, saying that he thought the appeal was not serious.|$|E
5|$|Just before midday on 11March, the USAF {{turned their}} {{attention}} (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, {{along with all the}} documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12–18March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the old facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also had the effect of obliterating the bodies of U.S. personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that U.S. technicians operating <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> evacuated on 10March, when it became amply clear the North Vietnamese were preparing to launch an assault.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} in a soy sauce shop long ago, in Totsuka-juku of the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), it {{sometimes}} happened that napkins would disappear in the night one by one. One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from a place where <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no people around. When he looked, there were several cats gathered, {{and there in the}} center was a strange sight: the shopkeeper's pet cat, wearing a napkin on its head and dancing. That explained why his napkins had been going missing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{amendment}} related merely to {{the manner in which}} it was proposed. Some argued that the amendment had been rushed through without proper debate and consultation. Because the constitutional right to citizenship had been introduced as part of the Good Friday Agreement it was argued that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consultation with Northern Ireland political parties. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the Good Friday Agreement). The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.|$|E

There were many variants, which <b>there</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> according to the single-author conviction.

25|$|Recent {{models have}} shown that, {{even with a}} dense CO2 atmosphere, early Mars was colder than Earth has ever been. However, transiently warm {{conditions}} related to impacts or volcanism could have produced conditions favoring {{the formation of the}} late Noachian valley networks, even though the mid–late Noachian global conditions were probably icy. Local warming of the environment by volcanism and impacts would have been sporadic, but <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> many events of water flowing at the surface of Mars. Both the mineralogical and the morphological evidence indicates a degradation of habitability from the mid Hesperian onward. The exact causes are not well understood but may be related to a combination of processes including loss of early atmosphere, or impact erosion, or both.|$|E
25|$|Errors in the {{original}} body and coffins counts quickly became apparent. Father John P. Chidwick, the Roman Catholic chaplain aboard the Maine {{at the time of}} its destruction, had overseen {{the original}} interments in February and March 1898. He now also oversaw the disinterment. Chidwick's records showed that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> 154 coffins, but only 151 were recovered. Additionally, Chidwick's list of the dead showed two unidentified bodies were unaccounted for. Several reasons for the discrepancies were offered: Clerical errors, errors made by the overburdened Chidwick, and more than one body in the same casket. Chidwick, Colon Cemetery officials, and Cuban authorities were convinced, however, that no bodies had been lost. Disinterment also revealed a new problem: At the time of burial, identified remains had a number painted on the exterior of the coffin that corresponded with a name on Chidwick's list of dead. But by the time of disinterment, the numbers on many of these coffins were unreadable. Identified remains thus became unidentified. Another problem was the way the dead were buried. As bodies were buried at Colon Cemetery, the row and grave number was supposed to be noted for each casket. Unfortunately, the cemetery superintendent only noted which row each identified body was in—not the actual grave number. This, too, made it sometimes impossible to determine in which grave identified remains laid. Some casket numbers were readable, however. Those bodies which still could be identified had their names painted on the exterior of the new coffin. The old coffins were burned.|$|E

500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none of us really being <b>there...</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called Wish We Were Here".|$|E

Brett Mallec from E! shared this view {{but added that}} the duos [...] "dancing skills aren't half bad". Louis Virtel from HitFix made 10 observations about the video, but concluded that <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more dance sequences to liven up the visuals, and hence could {{not live up to}} other [...] "all-time great" [...] Madonna releases. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone complimented the visual, saying that the [...] "better part of the video is a mostly harrowing scene for the pop star" [...] and compared it to the TV series The Last Man on Earth. James Elliot from Complex found the video to be [...] "captivating" [...] and keeping one [...] "surprised" [...] in spite of feeling it to be long.|$|E

She said that the story is more minor in the pack and that it was less funny than the main game. Petit was frustrated by the labyrinth-like design of some of the Genki Apocalypse levels, and was uninterested in Super Ethical PR Opportunity by the time the activity ended. Rock Paper Shotgun John Walker wanted something more expansive for the first pack, and expected something more original and strange along the lines of Saints Row 2 [...] "shit spraying" [...] activity.

500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash.
