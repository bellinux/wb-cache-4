40|$|A median {{mortality}} of 120 ± 30 days occurred among juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), fed dry fish food containing 2. 7, 5. 7, 2. 8, and 9. 1 uMg/g wet weight of 2, 8 di-, tri-, tetra-, and octachlorodibenzofuran, respectively (1). Only octachlorodibenzofuranx was {{detected in the}} dead fish, and the level was 0. 03 ug/g in the muscle and 0. 21,Ag/g in the gut (both values on wet weight basis). The fate of the lower chlorinated dibenzofurans was not known and additional experiments, described in this paper, were carried out with immature brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), fed relatively high levels of 2, 8 -dichlorodibenzofuran. Experimental The preparation of 2, 8 -dichlorodibenzofuran was carried out as described (2).

40|$|The {{procedure}} used {{to determine}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs), chlorinated dibenzodioxins, and chlorinated dibenzofurans is outlined in Table 1. It {{is based on the}} cleanup-chromatography of Holden and Marsden (1), modified as described (2). Most PCBs are eluted in fraction I. Fraction II contains some PCBs, p, p'-DDE, and PCTs, whereas heptachlor exposide, dieldrin, endrin, p,p'-DDD, and p, p'-DDT are eluted in fraction III. Fractions I and II are further chromatographed on alumina, essentially according to Porter and Burke (3), to determine chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. PCTs, hexa- and octachlorodibenzodioxin, and octachlorodibenzofuran were quantified by gas chromatography on 3 % OV- 210 on Chromosorb WAW 60 / 80 in a 6 ft X 4 mm column at 200 °C. A 4 % SE- 30 column was used to quantify PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, di-, tri-, and <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran.</b> Recovery of PCBs and chlorinated hydrocarbo...|$|E
40|$|Senior thesis {{written for}} Oceanography 445 [author abstract] The {{production}} of pulp, a paper product, involves {{a combination of}} chemical washes and combustion processes that are known sources of many persistent organic pollutants that can bio-accumulate in the environment with deadly effects. This paper investigates sediments collected from Nootka Sound, BC for traces of pulp mill effluent, specifically 2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2, 3, 7, 8 <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran,</b> potentially deposited there from a pulp mill that operated in the area from 1964 - 1998. 1. 305 ng/g of dioxins were detected at one depth in sediment that likely settled in 1988. Despite the positive detection of dioxins during a time the mill was in operation, further sediment analysis was not possible due to a high quantity of hydrocarbons, that restricted the remaining samples from complete analysis. Further investigation into these sediments requires a more reliable method to consistently analyze samples, but is warranted by the alarming amounts detected.

40|$|The cytochromes P 450 (CYPs), {{particularly}} the CYP 1 A family and CYP 1 A 1, {{have been used}} as biomarkers of exposure to certain classes of contaminants in both aquatic and terrestrial species. The types of chemical contaminants that cause induction of the CYP 1 A family are those that bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The classes of compounds that typically cause environmental induction of CYP 1 A are therefore coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), tetrachlorodibenzodioxins (TCDDs) and <b>tetrachlorodibenzofurans</b> (TCDFs). Non-coplanar PCBs induce the CYP 2 B family. The CYPs are thus biomarkers for environmental exposure to these classes of compounds. Because all organisms appear to be capable of the CYP 1 A induction response, the possible applications of this technique are widespread. It has been used in both the aquatic and the terrestrial areas and it can be used in regard to questions about contamination in a species or in a habitat. There are many approaches to evaluating the CYP status of organisms. They vary both in the techniques used to assess CYPs and in the sampling required to perform the assessment. At the most basic level the sampling methods can be divided into lethal and non-lethal. This includes both the development and validation procedures and the utilization of the proven methodology in the field. In some cases the species to be studied are abundant, such as carp (Cyprinus carpio) ...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{toxicological}} responses {{have been}} associated with certain chlorodibenzodioxins. One of these responses is chloracne, a folliculosis first associated with skin contamination by chlorohydrocarbons in 1899 (1)). Serious outbreaks of chloracne-like lesions associated with runaway reactions in the production of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol occurred in Germany in the early 1950 's (2). 2, 4, 5 -Trichlorophenol itself does not cause acne (3), but the contaminants which may be formed in the uncontrolled production of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol are extremely potent acnegens (2). 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin and tri- and <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran</b> were isolated from the contaminants formed in 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol production and were demonstrated to be strongly positive acnegens when applied to rabbit ears (3). By using the rabbit ear test, the acnegenic potency of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD) was confirmed in 1962 (4). In addition, 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD is extremely toxic in the chick embryo assay (5) and is highly embryotoxic in rats (6). Another chlorodibenzodioxin, hexachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (HCDD), is known to be positive for the chick edema factor, a condition characterized by hydropericardium, ascites, an...|$|E
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates many of the biological and toxic effects of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other structurally diverse ligands. While HAHs are several orders of magnitude more potent in producing AhR-dependent biochemical effects than PAHs or other AhR agonists, only the HAHs have been observed to produce AhR-dependent toxicity in vivo. Here we have characterized the dissociation of a prototypical HAH ligand ([3 H] 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD]) and PAH-like ligand ([3 H] b-naphthoflavone [bNF]) from the guinea pig, hamster, mouse, and rat hepatic cytosolic AhR in order to elucidate {{the relationship between the}} apparent ligand-binding affinities and the divergent potency of these chemicals. Both compounds dissociated very slowly from the AhR with the amount of specific binding remaining at 96 h ranging from 53 % to 70 % for [3 H]TCDD and 26 % to 85 % for [3 H] bNF, depending upon the species examined. The rate of ligand dissociation was unaffected by protein concentration or incubation temperature. Preincubation of cytosol with 2, 3, 7, 8 <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran,</b> carbaryl, or primaquine, prior to the addition of [3 H]TCDD, shifted the apparent IC 50 of these compounds as competitive AhR ligands by ~ 10 - to 50 -fold. Our results support the need for reassessment of previous AhR ligandbinding affinity calculations and competitive binding analysis since these measurements are not carried out at equilibrium binding conditions. Our studies suggest that AhR binding affinity/ occupancy has little effect on the observed differences in the persistence of gene expression by HAHs and PAHs...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a mitogenic {{polypeptide}} that induces {{proliferation and}} activation of kinase pathways in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. The role of estrogen receptor ? (ER?) in mediating responses induced by IGF-I {{was investigated in}} cells transfected with small inhibitory RNA for ER? (iER?) or cotreated with the pure antiestrogen ICI 182780. The results showed that IGF-I-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK, induction of G 1 ?S-phase progression and enhanced expression of cyclin D 1 and cyclin E were dependent on ER?. Moreover, these IGF-I-induced responses were also inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182780, suggesting {{that the effects of}} ICI 182780 as an inhibitor of IGF-I induced responses in breast cancer cells are primarily related to downregulation of ER?. Chemoprotective phytochemicals exhibit multiple activities and interact with several cellular receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We investigated the AhR agonist/antagonist activities of the following flavonoids: chrysin, phloretin, kaempferol, galangin, naringenin, genistein, quercetin, myricetin, luteolin, baicalein, daidzein, apigenin, and diosmin, in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, HepG 2 human liver cells and mouse Hepa- 1 cells. The dietary phytochemicals exhibited substantial cell context?dependent AhR agonist as well as antagonist activities, and these are factors that must be considered in risk assessment of overall exposures to AhR agonists. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 - pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), 3, 3 ?, 4, 4 ?, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (PCBP), 2, 3, 7, 8 - <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran</b> (TCDF) and 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) bind and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been assumed that these compounds only differ in their potencies. The SAhRM-like activity of the 5 HAHs was investigated by determining ligand structure dependent differences in their induction of CYP 1 A 1 and interactions of the AhR with a series of coactivators in a mammalian two-hybrid assay in three AhR-responsive cell lines, including mouse Hepa- 1, Human HEK 293 and human Panc 1 cells. There were multiple structure-dependent differences in activation of luciferase activity in these cell lines transfected with VP-AhR and six different GAL 4 -coactivator chimeras and a GAL 4 -response element-luciferase promoter construct. The results show that HAHs selectively interact with coactivators and these interactions are dependent on cell-context, and even among HAHs, these compounds exhibit selective receptor modulator activity...|$|E
40|$|For {{a better}} {{understanding}} of species-specific relative effect potencies (REPs), responses of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) were assessed. REPs were calculated using chemical-activated luciferase gene expression assays (CALUX) derived from guinea pig, rat, and mouse cell lines. Almost all 20 congeners tested in the rodent cell lines were partial agonists and less efficacious than 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). For this reason, REPs were calculated for each congener using concentrations at which 20 % of the maximal TCDD response was reached (REP 20 TCDD). REP 20 TCDD values obtained for PCDD/Fs were comparable with their toxic equivalency factors assigned by the World Health Organization (WHO-TEF), while those for PCBs were in general lower than the WHO-TEF values. Moreover, the guinea pig cell line was the most sensitive as indicated by the 20 % effect concentrations of TCDD of 1. 5, 5. 6, and 11. 0 pM for guinea pig, rat, and mouse cells, respectively. A similar response pattern was observed using multivariate statistical analysis between the three CALUX assays and the WHO-TEFs. The mouse assay showed minor deviation due to higher relative induction potential for 2, 3, 7, 8 - <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran</b> and 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexachlorodibenzofuran and lower for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzofuran and 3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′, 5 - pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachlorodibenzofuran was more than two times more potent in the mouse assay as compared with that of rat and guinea pig cells, while measured REP 20 TCDD for PCB 126 was lower in mouse cells (0. 05) as compared with that of the guinea pig (0. 2) and rat (0. 07). In order to provide REP 20 TCDD values for all WHO-TEF assigned compounds, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed. The QSAR models showed that specific electronic properties and molecular surface characteristics play important roles in the AhR-mediated response. In silico derived REP 20 TCDD values were generally consistent with the WHO-TEFs with a few exceptions. The QSAR models indicated that, e. g., 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 -hexachlorodibenzofuran were more potent than given by their assigned WHO-TEF values, and the non-ortho PCB 81 was predicted, based on the guinea-pig model, to be 1 order of magnitude above its WHO-TEF value. By combining in vitro and in silico approaches, REPs were established for all WHO-TEF assigned compounds (except OCDD), which will provide future guidance in testing AhR-mediated responses of DLCs and to increase our understanding of species variation in AhR-mediated effects. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To find whether {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in serum increased in workers at municipal incinerators that burn continuously.  METHODS— 30 Workers employed at three municipal {{waste incineration plants}} (incinerator workers) and 30  control workers were studied. The incinerator workers had worn dust masks or airline masks during the periodic repair work inside the incinerators. Previous job, dietary habit, smoking habit, distance from residence to the incineration plant, and body weight and height were obtained from a questionnaire survey. Concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were measured in the serum of the workers and the dust deposited in the plants. The influence of various factors on serum {{concentrations of}} PCDDs/PCDFs was examined by multiple regression analysis.  RESULTS—Dust analysis showed {{the greatest amount of}} octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF), and octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). The toxicity equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs and PCDFs in the deposited dust were 4. 8,  1. 0, and 6. 4  ng TEQs/g, respectively, for plants A, B, and C.  The mean serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs in the incinerator workers and control workers were 19. 2  and 22. 9  pg TEQs/g lipid, respectively, for area A, 28. 8  and 24. 5  pg TEQs/g lipid for area B, and 23. 4  and 23. 6  pg TEQs/g lipid for area C.  No {{significant differences were found between}} the incinerator workers and the controls for TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs separately, and TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs together. However, the serum 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF concentration was significantly higher in the incinerator workers than in the controls for all the three areas. When the exposure index to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF is defined as the product of the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in the deposited dust and duration of employment, the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in serum increased as the exposure index increased. Multivariate analysis suggested that the serum concentration of HpCDF increased with duration of employment at the incineration plants and OCDF increased with employment of ⩾ 21 years. The other significant variables (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 001) were area for hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) and <b>tetrachlorodibenzofuran</b> (TCDF), Brinkman index for HpCDD, and body mass index (BMI) for tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), HpCDD, and TEQs of PCDDs.  CONCLUSION—The serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs was not significantly higher among the incinerator workers, but the serum concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF was. This suggests that the incinerator workers had inhaled dust containing PCDDs and PCDFs while working in plants equipped with incinerators that burn continuously.    Keywords: serum dioxins; municipal waste incinerators; continuous burning; heptachlorodibenzofura...|$|E
