Stability of the <b>trapped</b> <b>particle</b> mode is sensitive to the electron connection between the stabilizer and the end plug. It is found that the stability condition for the <b>trapped</b> <b>particle</b> mode is more constraining than the stability condition for the MHD mode, and it is challenging to satisfy the required power constraint.
