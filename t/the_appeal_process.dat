Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>process</b> in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>process</b> forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> is {{employed}} in many organizations including administrative agencies, regulatory authorities, sports organizations, and private companies. This paper examines the dual role of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> in enhancing fairness and inducing performance in principal-agent {{relationships in the}} presence of imperfect performance evaluation. Some surprising results emerge. For example, the merit of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> depends on <b>the</b> agent's aversion to unfairness, and appeals may be optimally denied even if <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> is more accurate than the initial evaluation and is costless. An increase in the accuracy of the initial evaluation may reduce the principal's welfare. Furthermore, the principal's welfare can increase as the cost of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> increases. <b>Appeals</b> Fairness Principal-agent relationship...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>process</b> in <b>the</b> Department of Veterans Affairs (VA of the Department) is a complex, {{non-linear}} process, {{which is}} set in law and is unique from other standard <b>appeals</b> <b>processes</b> across <b>the</b> Federal and judicial systems.

Each time arguments are presented and evidence is added/ obtained, VA generally must issue another decision considering that evidence, which protracts the timeline for appellate resolution.|$|R

5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>process</b> does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E
