5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{is a popular}} species for game shooting because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led <b>to</b> <b>population</b> declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E

5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution <b>to</b> <b>population</b> decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers <b>to</b> <b>population</b> mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according <b>to</b> <b>population</b> density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional <b>to</b> <b>population</b> than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led <b>to</b> <b>population</b> decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed <b>to</b> <b>population</b> decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible <b>to</b> <b>population</b> depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population <b>to</b> <b>population</b> in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

Because of the potential hazards it poses <b>to</b> <b>population</b> centers, Mauna Loa is part of the Decade Volcanoes program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory since 1912. Observations of the atmosphere are undertaken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, and of the Sun at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, both located near the mountain's summit. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers the summit and the southeastern flank of the volcano, and also incorporates Kīlauea, a separate volcano.|$|E

5|$|Often {{encountered}} {{resting on}} the bottom during daytime, the reticulate whipray is a predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished at first by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females bear litters of up to five pups in summer, following a gestation period of a year. The reticulate whipray is fished in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean for meat, skin, cartilage, and other purposes. It is highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>population</b> depletion because of its large size, inshore habits, and low reproductive rate, and is additionally threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Consequently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, {{but in the case}} of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population <b>to</b> <b>population.</b> In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data <b>to</b> infer <b>population</b> structure and assign individuals <b>to</b> <b>populations.</b> We assume {{a model in}} which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) <b>to</b> <b>populations,</b> or jointly <b>to</b> two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals <b>to</b> <b>populations,</b> studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e. g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

40|$|Structurama is {{a program}} for {{inferring}} population structure. Specifically, the program calculates the posterior probability of assigning individuals <b>to</b> different <b>populations.</b> The program takes as input a file containing the allelic information at some number of loci sampled from a collection of individuals. After reading a data file into computer memory, Structurama uses a Gibbs algorithm to sample assignments of individuals <b>to</b> <b>populations.</b> The program implements four different models: The number of populations can be considered fixed or a random variable with a Dirichlet process prior; moreover, the genotypes of the individuals in the analysis can be considered {{to come from a}} single population (no admixture) or as coming from several different populations (admixture). The output is a file of partitions of individuals <b>to</b> <b>populations</b> that were sampled by the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The partitions are sampled in proportion to their posterior probabilities. The program implements a number of ways to summarize the sampled partitions, including calculation of the ‘mean’ partition—a partition of the individuals <b>to</b> <b>populations</b> that minimizes the squared distance to the sampled partitions...|$|R
