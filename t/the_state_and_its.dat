5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual needs of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> diverse citizenry. She {{writes that the}} intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E
5|$|The sole {{provider}} {{of higher education}} in Wagga Wagga is the local campus of the multi-campus Charles Sturt University, located {{on the outskirts of the}} suburb of Estella. The university was established on 1 July 1989 following the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 and involved the merger of several existing separately-administered Colleges of Advanced Education including the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga. At the time of its establishment it became the ninth university in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> inaugural vice-chancellor was C.D. Blake AO who at the time was the principal of the Riverina College.|$|E
5|$|Indiana, a {{state in}} the Midwest, played an {{important}} role in supporting the Union during the American Civil War. Despite anti-war activity within the state, and southern Indiana's ancestral ties to the South, Indiana was a strong supporter of the Union. Indiana contributed approximately 210,000 Union soldiers, sailors, and marines. Indiana's soldiers served in 308 military engagements during the war; the majority of them in the western theater, between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains. Indiana's war-related deaths reached 25,028 (7,243 from battle and 17,785 from disease). Its state government provided funds to purchase equipment, food, and supplies for troops in the field. Indiana, an agriculturally rich state containing the fifth-highest population in the Union, was critical to the North's success due to its geographical location, large population, and agricultural production. Indiana residents, also known as Hoosiers, supplied the Union with manpower for the war effort, a railroad network and access to the Ohio River and the Great Lakes, and agricultural products such as grain and livestock. The state experienced two minor raids by Confederate forces, and one major raid in 1863, which caused a brief panic in southern portions of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> capital city, Indianapolis.|$|E

The state and the party were generally successful, establishing unprecedented degrees of political and ideological integration of villages into the state and of village-level awareness of state policies and political goals.|$|E
25|$|While {{recognition}} of a special bond of mutual obligations between <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> Armed Forces dates back more than 400 years, {{it was not until}} 2000 that the Army published 'Soldiering – the Military Covenant' setting out the obligations on the soldier to make personal sacrifices {{in the service of the}} nation, and stated that the armed forces must be sustained by the nation. The code had been drafted over the course of three years by senior officers led by a Brigadier. The main author was Major-General Sebastian Roberts.|$|E

However, like some other American states, Delaware's capital is not its largest city. Consequently, Wilmington, {{in the northern part}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> largest city, has many state offices and employees one would normally expect to find in the state capital, including the headquarters of the Office of the Attorney General, especially as many large American corporations maintain nominal offices in that city to register their Delaware corporation.|$|E

25|$|Poor {{whites and}} landless former slaves {{suffered}} {{the most from}} the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes. It took years {{for the state to}} rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.|$|E

25|$|In Vergil's Aeneid, Aeneas {{brought the}} Trojan {{cult of the}} lares and penates from Troy, along with the Palladium which was later {{installed}} in the temple of Vesta. When Augustus became pontifex maximus in 12 BC he gave the Vestals his own house on the Palatine. His penates remained there as its domestic deities, and were soon joined by his lares. His gift therefore tied his domestic cult to the sanctified Vestals and Rome's sacred hearth and symbolically extended his domus to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> inhabitants. He also co-opted and promoted the traditional and predominantly plebeian Compitalia shrines and extended their festivals, whose Lares were known thereafter as Augusti.|$|E
25|$|Ahmad Bey (1837–1855) {{assumed the}} throne during this complex situation. Following the {{examples}} of the Ottoman Empire under sultan Mahmud II, and of Egypt under Muhammad Ali, he moved to intensify a program to update and upgrade the Tunisian armed forces. In pursuit of this policy, he instituted a military school and started industries in order to supply its more modern army and navy. In a major step, he initiated the recruitment and conscription of native Tunisians {{to serve in the}} army and navy, a step which would reduce the long division between <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> citizens. Yet the resulting tax increases were not popular.|$|E
25|$|The {{army was}} {{intrinsically}} {{linked to the}} very existence of the Bulgarian state. Its success under Tsar Simeon I marked the creation of a wide-ranging empire, and its defeat in a prolonged war of attrition in the early 11th century meant the end of Bulgarian independence. When the Bulgarian state was reestablished in 1185, a series of capable emperors achieved a remarkable string of victories over the Byzantines and the Western Crusaders, but as <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> army fragmented in the 13th and 14th centuries, it proved unable to halt the Ottoman advance, which resulted in the conquest of all of Bulgaria by 1422. It would not be until 1878, with the Liberation of Bulgaria, that a Bulgarian military would be restored.|$|E
