5|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} by Edward Lorenz (the Lorenz Energy Cycle), extratropical cyclones (so-called atmospheric transients) {{acts as a}} mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy. In the process, the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced (i.e. energy is transported poleward <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> the higher latitudes).|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Victory Test, {{again at}} Lord's, Miller {{came in at}} 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark before being removed for 118. He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. <b>To</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E

5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. <b>To</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{years after}} Sarah's death, Joel {{works as a}} {{smuggler}} in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point at the Massachusetts State House. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy {{in order to continue}} the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement in Jackson County, Colorado, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that he was telling the truth.|$|E
