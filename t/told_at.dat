5|$|With {{the plans}} for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be {{attempted}} across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story <b>told</b> <b>at</b> the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. In {{the view of the}} historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was <b>told</b> <b>at</b> Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan is said to have prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E

The pilot of the family was named Ray and there had been a prewritten letter about him to be <b>told</b> <b>at</b> the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Early on 13 March an {{official}} of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) <b>told</b> <b>at</b> a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core. At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power. Work to restore power and to vent excessive pressure continued. At one point, the top three meters of the uranium/mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were not covered by coolant.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of March 28, 1865, Grant {{modified}} his order, telling Sheridan to lead his troopers around the Confederate right flank and to fight the Confederates, with infantry support, if the Confederates came out of their trenches. Otherwise, Sheridan was to wreck the railroads {{as much as possible}} and again was <b>told,</b> <b>at</b> his discretion, that he could return to the Petersburg lines or join Sherman in North Carolina. Sheridan was told to move first {{to the rear of the}} V Corps and around their left flank to Dinwiddie Court House in an effort to outflank the Confederates and cut the Boydton Plank Road.|$|E

She collected {{a few of her}} many adult tales into volumes, Miss Eyre of Boston and Some Women's Hearts. It is in Boston that she did the greater part of her work, including her books of travel, Random Rambles and Lazy Tours, published her four volumes of poetry, and edited and prefaced biographies, A Last Harvest and Garden Secrets, and the Collected Poems of Philip Bourke Marston, as well as a selection from Arthur O'Shaughnessy's verses.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of the twelve books of La Fontaine's Fables extended from 1668 to 1694. The stories {{in the first six}} of these derive for the most part from Aesop and Horace and are pithily told in free verse. Those in the later editions are often taken from more recent sources or from translations of Eastern stories and are <b>told</b> <b>at</b> greater length. The deceptively simple verses are easily memorised, yet display deep insights into human nature. Many of the lines have entered the French language as standard phrases, often proverbial. The fables are also distinguished by their occasionally ironical ambivalence. The fable of “The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter” (IX.6), for example, reads like a satire on superstition, but its moralising conclusion that “All men, as far as in them lies,/Create realities of dreams” might equally be applied to religion as a whole.|$|E
25|$|During {{a sumptuous}} feast on the Isle of Love, Tethys, {{who is now}} the lover of da Gama, prophecies the future of Portuguese {{exploration}} and conquest. She tells of Duarte Pacheco Pereira's defense of Cochin (Battle of Cochin); the Battle of Diu fought by Francisco de Almeida and his son Lourenço de Almeida against combined Gujarati-Egyptian fleets; the deeds of Tristão da Cunha, Pedro de Mascarenhas, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio and Nuno da Cunha; and battles fought by Martim Afonso de Sousa and João de Castro. Tethys then guides da Gama to a summit and reveals to him a vision of how the (Ptolemaic) universe operates. The tour continues with glimpses of the lands of Africa and Asia. The legend of the martyrdom of the apostle St. Thomas in India is <b>told</b> <b>at</b> this point. Finally, Tethys relates the voyage of Magellan. The epic concludes with more advice to young King Sebastião.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} forms of headgear, in the Commonwealth, {{academic}} caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried. In some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to women, who do wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends {{in a number of}} universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland which have as a common theme that idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. This story is <b>told</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cambridge, Durham University, the University of Bristol, the University of St Andrews and Trinity College, Dublin among others. Indeed Newcastle University shares a similar legend as to why undergraduate academic dress do not contain a mortarboard; it is stated that the first cohort of independent Newcastle graduates from Durham University threw their hats into the River Tyne.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he <b>told</b> <b>at</b> least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|The Doomsday Scenario is the {{collective}} {{name of a}} series of Judge Dredd comic stories published in 2000 AD (progs 1141-1164) and the Judge Dredd Megazine (vol. 3 #52-59) in 1999. Written by John Wagner, it was the third such crossover story between those two publications, but was the first in which it was possible to read a complete and coherent tale by reading only those episodes which appeared in one comic or the other without having to buy both magazines. It was reprinted as two trade paperbacks, each collecting the episodes from one comic. When first published it was the longest Judge Dredd story arc ever <b>told,</b> <b>at</b> a total of 32 episodes and 279 pages, as well as several prequels and epilogues. The story tells of the Second Robot War in the year 2121, but its epilogues wrapped up two story arcs that had been developing for several years: former judge Galen DeMarco's unrequited love for Judge Dredd, and Dredd's bitter rivalry with Judge Edgar. The story is also notable for leading to the promotion of Judge Hershey, Dredd's sidekick and one of the strip's longest-running supporting characters, to the office of chief judge.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Kenshin was {{suddenly}} contacted by Usami Sadamitsu {{and a number of}} other acquaintances of his late father. They urged the young Nagao son to go to Echigo and contest his older brother's rule. It would seem that Harukage hadn't proven the most effective or inspiring leader (probably due to ill health), and his failure to exert control and gain support of the powerful kokujin families had resulted in a situation which was nearly to the point of tearing the province apart. As the story is <b>told,</b> <b>at</b> first Kenshin was reluctant to take the field against his own brother, but was eventually convinced that it was necessary to the survival of Echigo. At the age of 15 he was placed in joint command of Tochio castle, making a reputation for himself by successfully defending it against the rebels who were plotting against the Uesugi, and Kenshin succeeded in wresting control of the clan from Harukage in 1548. He stepped down from the lead of the clan and provincial government, and gave the titles to his younger brother. Harukage died five years later in 1553. At the age of 19 he became the head of the family and entered the Kasugayama Castle, but still as the retainer of the Uesugi clan.|$|E
