5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by <b>the</b> <b>clerics.</b>|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> set up base camp, River accesses {{footage of}} the Angel from the Byzantium to verify its secure. She and the Doctor leave to study a text written about Angels, {{learning}} that even an image of an Angel can become an Angel itself. They are unaware that Amy stayed to watch the footage, and when she blinks, the Angel appears to move. The Doctor helps her stop the video feed, and believes Amy is safe, but she feels something in her eye.|$|E

5|$|Baba is Amir's {{father and}} a wealthy {{businessman}} who aids the community by creating businesses for others and building a new orphanage. He is the biological father of Hassan, a fact he hides from both of his children, and seems to favor him over Amir. Similar to Hosseini's father, Baba does not endorse the religiosity demanded by <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> in the religion classes attended by Amir in school. In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E
5|$|Gotoh then arrives {{to inform}} Marth that Gharnef has kidnapped several female clerics, {{including}} Princess Nyna {{and his own}} sister Elice, to serve as sacrifices for the revival of Medeus. Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing <b>the</b> <b>clerics,</b> Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken {{the form of an}} enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I {{gave the}} chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, {{creating}} a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended {{with the onset of}} the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> were reduced to performing menial tasks.|$|E
5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries were {{a period}} of huge {{economic}} growth in England. The population of England rose from around 1.5million in 1086 to around 4or 5million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for {{the years of the}} Anarchy, most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, those who worked, in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or <b>the</b> <b>clerics.</b> Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified {{at the start of the}} period, although they were increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They {{may have been}} carved under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth at the behest of <b>the</b> <b>clerics,</b> however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the Head {{was kept}} in a special {{portable}} reliquary in Pechersky Ascension Monastery in Nizhny Novgorod, which <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> can reverently take with them {{on a visit to}} a nursing home or to celebrate Feast of Venerable Macarius at his other, Zheltovodsky Monastery.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempted}} {{conversion of}} the Irish to Protestantism also had few successes; at first <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> sent to Ireland were all English speakers, whereas the native population were usually monoglot speakers of Irish Gaelic.

25|$|The 20th century ruler, Reza Shah, banned all {{variations}} of face veil in 1936, as incompatible with his modernistic ambitions.

Many women gathered at the Goharshad Mosque in Mashhad with their faces covered to show their objection to the niqab ban.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s {{critics of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{increasingly}} used charges of spying, and of connections to foreign powers rather than simply labelling Bahá'ís as heretics. These new charges helped define a new 'other' and reaffirmed a threatened Shi'i self. This new attitude towards the Bahá'ís was now not confined to <b>the</b> <b>clerics,</b> but was also rampant among the secular Iranian middle-class. In the 1970s accusations of Bahá'ís being numerous in the Shah's regime surfaced, as well as there being a perception that Bahá'ís were generally better off {{than the rest of}} the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} monastery {{was probably}} established during the Second Bulgarian Empire (12th–14th centuries). The monastery {{had to endure}} torching and plundering raids in the 14th–18th centuries, {{the period of the}} early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. In the following decades, the support of the nearby Chiprovtsi Monastery meant that the Lopushna Monastery consolidated financially. In the 1840s, Archimandrite Dionysius and the hieromonks Gerasimus and Gideon of the Chiprovtsi Monastery joined the Lopushna Monastery, Dionysius as its hegumen (abbot). Having collected funds, <b>the</b> <b>clerics</b> sought to reconstruct the ill-maintained monastery buildings.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few days}} of the {{declaration}} of martial law and the violent suppression of the Fasci, Colajanni broke with Crispi and wrote the book Gli avvenimenti di Sicilia e le loro cause on the events in Sicily, which put the main blame on Crispi.
