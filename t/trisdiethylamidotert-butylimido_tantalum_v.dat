[66] has reported {{the synthesis of}} TaC by using reactants <b>tantalum</b> (<b>V)</b> chloride and carbon mixed under an argon-filled glove box via thermal technique and later transformed to TaC nanoparticles via chemical technique. CVD {{is one of the}} most useful methods to prepare monolayer graphene of high structural quality for use in different devices for catalytic activities [67]. Wang and group [26, 32] obtained CN푥 films on Ni substrate by using HFCVD method firstly. Because the preparation of these films is more likely to produce C–H and N–H linkage under the CVD conditions, most of the CN푥 films are amorphous. From previous studies, CVD procedures are used to prepare carbon nitrides, the choice of substrate materials is very critical to be considered. Large area samples can be prepared by exposing a metal to different hydrocarbon precursors at high temperatures. There are different types of CVD methods available such as plasma-enhanced CVD, thermal CVD, and hot/cold wall CVD. CVD methods mainly consist of electron cyclotron resonance, hot filament-assisted, DC glow discharge, radiofrequency discharge, and microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition. Bias of auxiliary hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) is one of the local tools used in the deposition of diamond films and others. The exact mechanism of the formation of graphene depends on the growth substrate but typically initiates with the growth of carbon atoms that nucleate on the metal after decomposition of the hydrocarbons, and the nuclei grow then into large domains [68]. Recently, produced high-quality monolayer graphene by using resistive heating cold wall CVD was also 100 times faster than conventional CVD.|$|R

The structures and purity of these complexes were confirmed by NMR, infrared and mass spectroscopies and elemental analysis. They show good solubility in most common solvents especially non-viscous solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) showed reversible to quasi reversible behavior for all the reduction couples and the oxidation peaks were irreversible. Spectroelectrochemistry of the complexes confirmed metal and ring redox processes for TaPc and TiPc derivatives and ring based processes only for VPc complexes. The synthesis of gold nanoparticles and their conjugation with the new phthalocyanines was carried out. Similarly, single walled carbon nanotubes were conjugated to selected tantalum complexes and the characterization of all the nanomaterials and their conjugates using different techniques that include TEM, XRD and AFM is also presented in this work. The photophysical and photochemical properties and photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexene properties of the newly synthesised {{in the presence of}} gold nanoparticles were investigated. The compounds were stable, well within the stability range for phthalocyanines. The singlet oxygen quantum yield values increased drastically in the presence of gold nanoparticles. The photocatalytic products obtained from the reaction were cyclohexene oxide, 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -ol, 2 -cyclohexene- 1 -one and 1, 4 -cyclohexanediol. The percentage conversion values, yields and selectivity values improved significantly in the presence of AuNPs. Singlet oxygen was determined to be the main agent involved in the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexene. The electrocatalytic oxidation of bisphenol A and p-nitrophenol was carried out using nickel tetraamino phthalocyanine and all the newly synthesised metallophthalocyanine in the presence of gold nanoparticles and single walled carbon nanotubes.

40|$|Some of the unirradiated High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) control {{elements}} discharged {{during the late}} 1990 s were observed to have cladding damage [...] local swelling or blistering. The cladding damage {{was limited to the}} tantalum/europium interface of the element and is thought to result from interaction of hydrogen and europium to form a compound of lower density than europium oxide, thus leading to a ''blistering'' of the control plate cladding. Reducing the tantalum loading in the control plates should help preclude this phenomena. The impact of the change to the control plates on the operation of the reactor was assessed. Regarding nominal, steady-state reactor operation, the impact of the change in the power distribution in the core due to reduced tantalum content was calculated and found to be insignificant. The magnitude and impact of the change in differential control element worth was calculated, and the differential worths of reduced <b>tantalum</b> elements <b>vs</b> the current elements from equivalent-burnup critical configurations were determined to be unchanged within the accuracy of the computational method and relevant experimental measurements.

40|$|Texto en español y resumen en inglésThis section {{describes}} {{our latest}} results concerning mononuclear tert-butilimido niobium and <b>tantalum</b> (<b>V)</b> compounds. Complexes containing metal-ligand multiple bonds, particularly early transition metal-imido species, constitute an interesting subject {{because they are}} implicated as reagents or catalysts in oxidation and metathesis processes. The 1990 ºs have witnessed the spectacular {{development of a new}} generation of "non-metallocene" catalysts, a lot of examples show that this is a scientific area of constant activity. 4 - 8 In recent years, many neutral groups imido complexes have been synthesized, 9 although their functionalities were used as ancillary groups 10 - 11 to support high-oxidation state metal centers in some cases. The imido ligand is a reactive group that participates in transformations such as imine and carbodiimide metathesis, imido-to-oxo ligand exchange and the activation C-H bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons. 13, 15, 17 - 19, 223, 237 More recently the synthesis of neutral and cationic imido tantalum compounds and their behavior in migratory insertion reactions with small unsaturated molecules have been reported. In these processes, the resulting [M{C(R) }E] (E = O, NR?; R, R? =alkyl, aryl) moieties are a powerful key for C-C bond formation under mild reaction conditions and simultaneously, are versatile intermediates in transition metal promoted transformations. 13, 15, 17, 223, 237 In this context, our research group completed a study about the insertion of isocyanide Ar-NC (Ar = 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3) into the M-Me bond of [MCp*Cl 4 -xMex] (M = Nb, 18 Ta, 19 - 20, 260 Cp*= ? 5 -C 5 Me 5; x= 1 - 4) complexes, in which a series of iminoacyl (x= 1), azametalacyclopropane (x= 2, 3) and alkenylamido imido (x= 3, 4) derivatives were synthesized. In addition, new iminoacyl compounds [MLX(NAr) {C(R) NAr} (M= Nb, L = ? 5 -C 5 H 4 SiMe 3; M = Ta, L = ? 5 -C 5 Me 5; X= Cl,R; Ar = 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3) were obtained via insertion of isocyanide into M-Calkyl bond of alkyl chlorides or dialkyl imido complexes [MLXR(NAr) ]; in contrast with previous results the insertion into alkyl methyl imido species implied the migration of the alkyliminoacyl and alkyl methyliminoacyl complexes, respectively. 16 In view of these precedents and as an extension inside the research line of our group the main target of this Ph. D. work has been: The synthesis, reactivity and non-rigidity stereochemical studies of new imido niobium and tantalum complexes, using the high resolution Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance, particularly 15 N. Conclusions: 1) New imido niobium and tantalum (M= Nb, Ta) imido complexes, trichlorido [MCl 3 (NtBu) Lx] (M=Nb, Ta; L=py, x = 2; L=tmeda, x= 1), dichlorido hydridotris(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazolyl) borate [MTp*Cl 2 (NtBu) ] (M=Nb, Ta; L=BH(3, 5 -Me 2 C 3 HN 2) 3 =Tp*), trialkyl [MR 3 (NtBu) ] (M=Nb,Ta; R=Me, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 tBu, CH 2 CMe 2 Ph, CH 2 SiMe 3; M=Ta, R=CH 2 CMeCH 2) alkyl chlorido and dimethyl [MTp*XR(NtBu) ] (M=Nb, Ta; X=Cl, R=Me, CH 2 CH 3, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 tBu, CH 2 SiMe 3, CH 2 CMe 2 Ph; X=R=Me) and amido [MTp*X(NMe 2) (NtBu) ] (M=Nb, Ta; X=Cl, Me, NMe 2) have been prepared. 2) NMR spectroscopic data support a cis,mer-pseudooctaedral geometry of the trichlorido compounds. The bis-pyridine species show an exchange process between pyaxial and pyfree, whereas in the tmeda derivatives the bidentate ligand maintains a rigid axial/equatorial disposition. Trialkyl complexes exhibit a characteristic three-legged piano-stool geometry with three alkyl groups ? bonded to metal atom, except in the tris- 2 -methylallyl tantalum derivative in which the ligands are ? 3 -CH 2 CMeCH 2 coordinated. Alkyl chlorido compounds [MTp*ClR(NtBu) ] are fac-pseudooctahedral with two different conformational states of alkyl ligand (gauche-syn gauche-anti), observed in solution and solid state. 3) The insertion of 2, 6 -dimethylphenyl isocyanide into the M-C bond of alkyl imido complexes takes place with the formation of alkyl bis-iminoacyl and chlorido methyl iminoacyl compounds from trialkyl and alkyl chlorido species, respectively. In the last case, for M= Nb when the insertion is followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy we can observe an irreversible endo- [...] > exo- isomerization process whose rate is dependent of volume of the alkyl group, whereas for M=Ta only the direct formation of exo- isomers was observed. The amido complexes [MTp*X(NMe 2) (NtBu) ] reactivity was tested against trispentafluorophenylborane, resulting in: i- amido chloride derivatives are inert, ii-methyl species result in "cation like" amido compounds [MTp*(NMe 2) (NtBu) ]+ [BMe(C 6 F 5) 3]- (M = Nb, Ta), in which the exchange takes place between two enantiomers through a cationic transition state and iii- bis-amido complexes, Lewis acid H-abstracting a ligand dimethylamido methyl group, as the mechanism that we proposed, forming a cationic species containing an imine ligand-K 2 N [MTp*(NMe 2) (NtBu) {NMe(CH 2) -K 2 N}]+ [BH(C 6 F 5) 3]- (M = Nb, Ta). 4) In amido imido complexes [MTp*X(NMe 2) (NtBu) ] the rotation about M-Namido bonded is restricted and its speed depends on the inductive effect (I) substituent NMe 2 > Me > Cl, being slightly faster for niobium. However, cationic species [MTp*NMe 2 (NtBu) ]+ [BMe (C 6 F 5) 3]- and [MTp*(NMe 2) {NMe(CH 2) -K 2 N) (NtBu) ]+ [BH(C 6 F 5) 3]- the speed of rotation is much greater than in neutral species. Furthermore, the process of ligand pseudorotation vector Tp* B-M around the carbocationic species [MTp*(NMe 2) (NtBu) {NMe(CH 2) - K 2 N) (NtBu) ]+ was observed and characterized. 5) In all the isoestructural compounds the chemical shifts 15 Nimido-Nb are greater than 15 Nimido-Ta due to the diamagnetic component of the shielding magnetic constant. However, the ligand resonances iminoacyl as much 15 N and 13 C are more shielded by niobium complexes and do not depend on the atomic number of the metal (M = Nb, Ta), but rather on its electronegativity...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) techniques enable {{fabrication of}} bone-mimicking meta-biomaterials with unprecedented combinations of topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties. The mechanical performance of AM meta-biomaterials {{is a direct}} function of their topological design. It is, however, not clear {{to what extent the}} material type is important in determining the fatigue behavior of such biomaterials. We therefore aimed to determine the isolated and modulated effects of topological design and material type on the fatigue response of metallic meta-biomaterials fabricated with selective laser melting. Towards that end, we designed and additively manufactured Co-Cr meta-biomaterials with three types of repeating unit cells and three to four porosities per type of repeating unit cell. The AM meta-biomaterials were then mechanically tested to obtain their normalized S-N curves. The obtained S-N curves of Co-Cr meta-biomaterials were compared to those of meta-biomaterials with same topological designs but made from other materials, i. e. Ti- 6 Al- 4 <b>V,</b> <b>tantalum,</b> and pure titanium, available from our previous studies. We found the material type to be far more important than the topological design in determining the normalized fatigue strength of our AM metallic meta-biomaterials. This is the opposite of what we have found for the quasi-static mechanical properties of the same meta-biomaterials. The effects of material type, manufacturing imperfections, and topological design were different in the high and low cycle fatigue regions. That is likely because the cyclic response of meta-biomaterials depends not only on the static and fatigue strengths of the bulk material but also on other factors that may include strut roughness, distribution of the micro-pores created inside the struts during the AM process, and plasticity. Statement of significance: Meta-biomaterials are a special class of metamaterials with unusual or unprecedented combinations of mechanical, physical (e. g. mass transport), and biological properties. Topologically complex and additively manufactured meta-biomaterials have been shown to improve bone regeneration and osseointegration. The mechanical properties of such biomaterials are directly related to their topological design and material type. However, previous studies of such biomaterials have largely neglected the effects of material type, instead focusing on topological design. We show here that neglecting the effects of material type is unjustified. We studied the isolated and combined effects of topological design and material type on the normalized S-N curves of metallic bone-mimicking biomaterials and found them to be more strongly dependent on the material type than topological design.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{orthopedic}} surgeries is increasing, so {{is the need for}} implants that not only can reconstruct a mechanical stable joint, but also serve as bone replacement material since the availability of transplant bone is rather limited. Already more than two decades porous metal implants have been a solution to address this need since they can exhibit mechanical properties close to human bone and thus provide sufficient implant strength and stability {{while at the same time}} they allow for bone to grow inside the pores, ensuring a long-term implant fixation. Only now, with the introduction of additive manufacturing or 3 D printing techniques like selective laser melting it has become possible to manufacture on an industrial scale porous metallic structures in a controlled and reproducible manner. In this dissertation three types of porous metallic implants made by selective laser melting have been evaluated: porous implants made from Ti 6 Al 4 <b>V,</b> <b>tantalum</b> and pure titanium. Today, Ti 6 Al 4 V is still the material of choice since it is a mechanically strong material with a proven clinical track record. But in order to select the right implant design and processing steps, it is important to identify all the variables that influence the final result. This dissertation presents and discusses probably the largest experimental data set on the influence of geometrical variables (structure relative density and unit cell geometry) and processing variables (build orientation, heat treatment, bio-functionalizing surface treatments) on the mechanical and biological implant performance. Tantalum, on the other hand, is an interesting metal since it has a very good biocompatibility, but because of its high price and difficulty to process, the use of tantalum for porous implants is not that obvious. In this dissertation it is shown for the first time that selective laser melting can be successfully used to manufacture porous tantalum implants with interesting mechanical properties and promising in vivo performance. Since porous pure titanium implants showed very similar mechanical behavior, this could potentially lead to a revival of the use of pure titanium for dynamically loaded porous implants. But in the end, the manufacturing cost is also important for the acceptance of this new technology to produce porous metallic implants on a commercially suitable level. Therefore significant productivity improvements have been achieved to lower the production costs of porous implants made by selective laser melting. nrpages: 120 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Polyoxometalates are {{a rapidly}} growing class of {{discrete}} metal oxide clusters {{with a wide range}} of applications including functional materials. These anionic clusters of the group V and VI transition metals are inexpensive and non-toxic. Within group V polyoxometalates, niobium and tantalum chemistry has been underdeveloped owing to their unique solubility and speciation in alkaline conditions compared to the acidic group VI polyoxometalates. This thesis compares the solution behavior of analogous hexacoltanate structures [Ta₆O₁₉]⁸⁻ and [Nb₆O₁₉]⁸⁻, their association with counterions, and their potential as thin film precursors. Tetramethylammonium hexametalate salts, [(CH₃) ₄N](₈₋ₓ) HₓM₆O₁₉, have been synthesized in an effort to provide a metal-oxide thin film precursor without incorporating counterions into the final film composition. These structurally identical analogues differ only by a single proton, which affects the behavior of these clusters in solution and in turn, the quality of the thin films that are obtained. Furthermore, these tetramethylammonium hexametalates react with hydrogen peroxide, exchanging terminal multiply bound oxygens with peroxide which yields [(CH₃) ₄N](₈₋ₓ) [HₓM₆(O₂) ₆O₁₃]. Small and wide angle x-ray scattering is utilized to analyze the hexametalates in solution and determine any interactions between these highly charged species. Polyoxometalates are ideal to study with x-ray scattering since the high Z metals in the cluster provide excellent electron density contrast with low Z solvents such as water. We observe differences in the solution behavior, indicating that hexatantalate and hexaniobate are not as similar as originally expected. Density functional theory calculations have determined the energetics of peroxide addition as well as preferred sites for substitution. This thesis also compares the ion association of the alkali salts of niobium and tantalum hexametalates. The association of clusters with their counterions precedes crystallization and is therefore an important step in structure elucidation. Hexacoltanates exhibit increased solubility with increased ion association, making them an ideal study to understand the fundamentals of ion pairing. Small and wide angle x-ray scattering as well as conductivity are utilized to investigate ion association as a function of counterion, concentration, solvent polarity, and niobium <b>vs.</b> <b>tantalum.</b> Overall, we observe increased ion association with decreasing solvent polarity. While the increasing ion association with increasing alkali size is expected for hexaniobate, there are some discrepancies with hexatantalate which we attribute to the concomitant effects of protonated clusters. This thesis provides evidence that structurally identical species do not necessarily exhibit the same behavior in solution. Differences in stability, protonation, and electrostatic interactions with counterions provide some insight into the anomalous solubility of niobium and tantalum polyoxometalates...|$|R
