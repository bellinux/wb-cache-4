30|$|The {{processing}} flow of FD-ISFA is as follows.

5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by <b>the</b> <b>ambiguity</b> of its message.
