50|$|On the trial, {{evidence}} was introduced tending {{to show that}} Seagram had fixed maximum prices above which the wholesalers could not resell. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner, and damages were awarded. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed (182 F.2d 228). It held that an agreement among respondents to fix maximum resale prices did not violate the Sherman Act, because such prices promoted, rather than restrained, competition. It also held the <b>evidence</b> <b>insufficient</b> to <b>show</b> that respondents had acted in concert. Doubt as to the correctness of the decision on questions important in antitrust litigation prompted the Supreme Court to grant certiorari.|$|R

50|$|The Arizona District Court {{found that}} no pygmy owl had been {{detected}} anywhere {{within the school}} site, and that the <b>evidence</b> was <b>insufficient</b> to <b>show</b> that a pygmy owl had used any portion of the 60 acre parcel. The court also concluded that while the evidence supported an inference that a pygmy owl used the 30 acre parcel, the allegation that the construction would harm the owl lacked such support, and was weakened by inconsistent facts. As to harassment of the pygmy owl, the court determined that the evidence did not show that the bird's behavioral patterns would be adversely affected by construction of the school. In the court's view, only speculation supporting the assertion that human activity associated with the school would harass the owl.|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, <b>evidence</b> is <b>insufficient</b> to <b>show</b> aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|R
50|$|In March 2009, {{after an}} {{abortion}} on a nine-year-old girl raped by her stepfather and pregnant with twins had been performed {{to save her}} life, Archbishop José Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife stated that automatic excommunication had been incurred by the girl's mother and the medical team. President Lula da Silva and Health Minister José Gomes Temporão decried his statement, and the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil disowned it, saying that the mother was certainly not excommunicated and there was <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> to <b>show</b> that {{any member of the}} medical team was. The statement was criticized also on the Vatican newspaper by the President of the Pontifical Academy for Life.

5000|$|His {{views about}} the {{effectiveness}} of influenza vaccines and his outspokenness about them are also controversial; at a 2007 meeting on pandemic preparedness he was shunned by other vaccine researchers and ate alone.

He has said that the studies claiming large reductions in mortality rates {{as a result of the}} influenza vaccine are [...] "rubbish", and that [...] "influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science". [...] He has called repeatedly for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials to prove the efficacy of flu vaccines, a position that most in the field hold as unethical.

40|$|Thiopurines are {{commonly}} used drugs in inflammatory bowel disease. Intracellular levels of thiopurine metabolites [i. e. 6 -thioguaninenucleotides (6 -TGN) ] are associated with efficacy and toxicity. Because 6 -TGN measurement is not globally available, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) has been proposed as a surrogate marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. To analyze the relationship between MCV and efficacy of thiopurines, defined as either response to therapy or 6 -TGN levels. A systematic search on PubMed was performed. Fifteen studies were included. In six studies, a positive association was found between ΔMCV and 6 -TGN. In four studies, {{it was suggested that}} ΔMCV can be used to predict clinical remission. In five articles, no association was found. In the majority of articles, it was reported that ΔMCV is useful in guiding intracellular metabolite levels.

40|$|The {{excretion}} in {{the urine}} of 58 Co after an oral dose of 58 Co vitamin B 12 given together with intrinsic factor {{has been found to}} be reduced in a number of patients with psoriasis, eczema, and other less common dermatoses. There is a correlation between the abnormality and the extent of the rash. A reduced glomerular filtration rate was found in a few of the patients in whom it was measured, and this must have been responsible, at least in part, for the reduced excretion of vitamin B 12 in these patients, but abnormal vitamin B 12 excretion also occurred in the absence of impaired renal function. Our <b>evidence</b> is <b>insufficient</b> to <b>show</b> whether malabsorption or increased tissue utilization of vitamin B 12 was the explanation in other cases. Certainly a number of patients had steatorrhoea, and in these it is most likely that malabsorption was the major factor. In patients without steatorrhoea a lone malabsorption of vitamin B 12 cannot be excluded. A decreased serum concentration of vitamin B 12 was found in only one of the patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{capillary}} counterdiffusion {{method is}} a very efficient crystallization technique for obtaining high-quality protein crystals. This technique requires a convection-free environment, which can be achieved using either gelled solutions, very thin capillaries, or microgravity conditions. To study {{the influence of a}} convection-free environment on protein crystal quality and to evaluate two different experimental implementations to achieve it, we have made a comparative analysis of crystals grown by capillary counterdiffusion in agarose, a convective-free environment on Earth, and crystals grown in microgravity at the International Space Station. Thermotoga maritima triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) was chosen as a model for this study. The statistical analysis reveals a significant improvement for the crystals grown in microgravity in terms of their R-merge, B-value, and mosaicity, but the statistical <b>evidence</b> is <b>insufficient</b> to <b>show</b> a similar benefit for the resolution and mean intensity parameters. These results are quite surprising because it is known that, unlike gels, the noisy microgravity scenario offered by the ISS cannot sustain a convection-free environment on the time scale of days required for protein crystallization experiments.
