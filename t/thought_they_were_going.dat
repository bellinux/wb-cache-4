500|$|In the November 6, 2012, general election, Mitt Romney lost as President Obama was re-elected. [...] The couple, {{along with}} the senior {{campaign}} staff, had <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to win up until polls closed that evening and returns started coming in. Ann cried as her husband concluded their chances were over, then appeared stricken as she went on stage with him following his concession speech.|$|E
500|$|William Petit {{had been}} able to free himself, escape his confines, and call to a {{neighbor}} for help. The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes." [...] Petit then told the jury, [...] "I thought, it's now or never because in my mind at that moment, I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to shoot all of us." ...|$|E

[...] He went on to call the defeat his [...] "lowest moment in football." [...] Wrexham midfielder Davies accused Arsenal of underestimating their opponents and felt their unrest at having conceded the equaliser worked to the home side's advantage: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to be a lot}} more professional when they were leading and tighten it up. They treated it as a training match. We've got a team of youngsters and two old men and perhaps our desire to win was greater than theirs." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawson {{added that}} Darren is [...] "totally {{in love with}} Nancy. Nancy has really calmed Darren down". Fox added, {{regarding}} {{the beginning of their}} relationship, [...] "It was a relationship that came out of nowhere, but the writers and the audience were so charmed by Nancy and Darren together that it's kept going". When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, [...] "Yes, i was. The scene in which they got together was absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up and there she was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox later explained that the pairing [...] "was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'"

5000|$|In Episode 7, [...] "Deep Woods, Part 2," [...] {{both teams}} started out at {{relatively}} {{the same spot}} (see map, right). Each team was told to head east, pass through the swamp, and arrive in the meadow. Neither team was told that a lake lay in their path. The shortest course for each team would be to pass between the lakes. Team One navigated east correctly, but then took the long way (north) around the lake. Their five-hour hike turned into a 10-hour trek. Team One arrived at the meadow, however. Team Two's navigation was errant, and the team traveled east for {{only a short time}} before drifting east-southeast. When Team Two reached the lake, they became lost and turned north when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> south. Team Two then mistakenly doubled back to its starting point and never made it to the meadow.|$|R

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as player and journalist, Fingleton {{persistently}} came into personal conflict with Don Bradman, one of the captains under whom Fingleton played, damaging the reputations of both. Bradman characteristically held his silence during Fingleton's lifetime. Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, he gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with those of Irish descent such as Fingleton being Catholic and Anglo-Australians such as Bradman being predominantly Protestant, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. During the 1936–37 Ashes series in Australia, four Catholics, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, leading batsman and vice-captain Stan McCabe along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. When Bradman was dismissed in his final Test innings in 1948 for a duck, Fingleton and O'Reilly were reported to be laughing hysterically in the pressbox. E W Swanton said that [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have stroke". Bradman later wrote after both had died: [...] "With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, a {{diplomatic}} {{source close to}} the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union entailing much closer fiscal, economic and political convergence. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which [...] "could force them to stage new referendums" [...] on euro adoption.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson). Fox commented that the relationship [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] but because the writers and audience were [...] "charmed" [...] it was kept long term. Fox told Laura-Jane Tyler of Inside Soap that she [...] "never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox added that she was initially surprised {{when she heard the}} about the pairing. She explained that [...] "it was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".

50|$|Whilst at Thetford, the {{division}} had formed part of First Army in Central Force. In June 1916 it moved to Harrogate {{as part of}} Local Forces in Northern Command.

2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to shut us down, and I thought I was {{going to be out of}} a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Texan {{officials}} {{began the}} treaty talks with demands that were unacceptable or impossible to fulfill for the Comanches, {{such as the}} Comanche return all white captives, including the famous captive Cynthia Parker. Other white captives were with bands of the Comanche not represented at the talks. [...] As a show of good faith the Comanche chiefs brought in two captives, a Mexican boy and an adolescent girl named Matilda Lockhart. The Texans <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> against their word, because the Comanche chiefs did not return all of the white captives and figured they held back some of their white captives to guarantee their own safety. Exercising a premeditated plan of violating the immunity of the peace delegation, the Texas militiamen told the chiefs it was they that would indeed be held hostage to guarantee the release of their other white captives. Everyone panicked and drew their weapons. The militia began firing and the entire Comanche peace delegation was killed.. Oklahoma Press. 1952.|$|E
