5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, Noreen's {{situation}} is not unusual. Though {{no one has been}} executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> being processed. In May 2014, Noreen's appeal hearing was delayed for the fifth time.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 a case by {{the state}} of California against a number of {{companies}} decided against Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra and ordered them to pay $1.15 billion. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> currently under appeal.|$|E
5|$|In {{academic}} circles <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> generally seen as {{an example}} of the court taking two different approaches to statutory interpretation, with the legalistic approach of the majority judges in contrast with the purposive approach of the minority judges.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{the motion}} to re-open <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> denied by <b>the</b> authorities, stating that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> not {{sufficient}} for re-opening.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> {{assigned}} to Judge Ronald S.W. Lew on September 21, 2005. The following year, Lew took senior status and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> eventually re{{assigned to}} Judge Stephen G. Larson on October 30, 2006. In November 2009, Larson recused himself and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> reassigned to Judge Otis D. Wright II.|$|R
5|$|Later, Detective Thomas tells Black that {{he really}} has no problem with Murphy—his true issue with <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> his own past. Having {{investigated}} sexual offences in the past, Thomas had found the cases affecting him personally, leaving him unable {{to have sex with}} his wife and leading to their divorce.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins) tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) about a {{woman who}} stabbed herself repeatedly. Harrison insists that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> an X-File and that the woman was killed by monsters that her son Tommy saw. She also {{believes}} that the monster killed the family cat, Spanky. Although Scully dismisses Harrison's claims, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) decide to investigate.|$|E
5|$|When found, Berrios-Beguerisse's {{body was}} nude, had {{ligature}} marks on both wrists and legs, and brown tape {{stuck to her}} hair. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> considered solved and closed according to police.|$|E
50|$|On May Day 1995 <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{challenged}} by defence barristers, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{an abuse of}} process and that charges should be stayed as {{the passage of time}} had made a fair trial impossible. The presiding magistrate agreed and as <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> never presented before a jury, the law regards the accused as presumed innocent.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> appealed in <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1940. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{heard by}} Judges Garrecht, Haney, and Healy, who {{rejected}} all of defense counsel's arguments.|$|R
5|$|A Boston man (Joe Towne) is {{attacked}} by a shadowy, ghost-like figure; his wife (Michelle Harrison) returns home to find he disintegrates into ash upon being touched. After learning all of the victims had recently visited a hospital before dying, Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick) explains <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> similar to one he had trouble with in the past, in which his obsessive behavior effectively ended his marriage to his wife Diane. The suspect, an Eastern European man, had contacted him four years ago sounding distraught {{and asked him to}} figure out a special formula, which Broyles was unable to solve. Walter (John Noble) and Peter (Joshua Jackson) study the victim's remains at their lab and begin studying the formula given to Broyles.|$|E
5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{returns to}} Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when {{she tries to}} arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the {{particle}} accelerator, but Davey reveals {{that he has been}} helping the government hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the particle accelerator, but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{appealed to}} <b>the</b> District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court's decision, {{although}} three judges dissented. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> then {{appealed to the}} Supreme Court.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{presided over}} by Judge Bishop. Verdicts in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>were</b> {{returned}} from a jury on September 8, 1995 and September 10, 1995 of life imprisonment, instead of the death penalty.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{taken to}} <b>the</b> European Court of Human Rights, which gave {{judgement}} on 7 June 2007 that {{the rights of}} free expression of the journalists involved in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>were</b> not respected.|$|R
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{a waste of time and}} they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{expected}} {{to highlight the}} effect of violent films on teenagers but the presiding judge, John Cheroske, ordered that evidence pertaining to Scream be barred and that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> not <b>be</b> {{referred to as the}} [...] "Scream murder", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> tried as murder and nothing else.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> appealed by <b>the</b> author William Alpert to the UN {{under the}} right of direct {{petition}} for individuals. As a consequence <b>the</b> <b>case</b> name <b>was</b> changed to Alpert v Australia.

With the help of Detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) they investigate, with all the evidence pointing towards the victims son, Mike (Jake O'Connor). Whilst <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> on-going, Megan receives flashbacks to her childhood. Meanwhile, Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) is asked by Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{to help him with}} a case.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professors are {{initially}} {{nominated by}} leaders representing either a department or school. The {{chair of the}} faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> then reviewed again by the Academic Council {{and approved by the}} Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were set down and distributed due to the excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{assigned to}} U.S. District Judge Mary Murguia. In June 2009, {{in response to}} a motion filed by Arpaio's lawyers, she recused herself. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> then assigned to U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> remitted back to {{the sheriff}} court to proceed. The Reporter took the view that {{in the light of}} factors {{including}} the publicity since Kelbie's decision, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> severely compromised. <b>The</b> application was formally abandoned.|$|R
25|$|Justice Stewart wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{that said that}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{should not have been}} heard by the Supreme Court because <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> moot, as Powell had already been seated in the 91st Congress by <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> appealed to <b>the</b> Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|Martha Wise (1884 – June 28, 1971), born Martha Hasel, was an American poisoner and serial killer. After {{her husband}} died and her family forced her to end a {{relationship}} with a new lover, Wise retaliated by poisoning seventeen family members, of whom three died, in 1924. She was convicted of one of the murders, despite defense claims that she was mentally ill and that her lover had ordered her to poison her family. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{considered one of the most}} sensational of the era in Ohio, where it occurred.|$|E
5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Skinner remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a bearded man {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme. He saves Skinner and sacrifices {{one of his own}} men. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> closed and Skinner is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). The bearded man was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{dismissed}} in November 1995 on a legal technicality, as {{it emerged}} that Dempsey's owner, {{not involved in}} the original incident, was unaware that the court hearing was taking place. This legal loophole meant <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> thrown out.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> remanded for a {{trial on}} the {{adequacy}} of the shelter grant. While <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> pending, an administrative procedure was implemented pursuant to Jiggetts that allows AFDC recipients to receive shelter costs in excess of the shelter grant.|$|R
