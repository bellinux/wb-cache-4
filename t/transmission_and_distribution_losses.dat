This paper proposes the application of an efficient loss allocation method developed to evaluate the marginal loss coefficients of dispersed generation. The coefficients provide the contribution to the active and reactive losses of each producer/consumer in order to define the respective tariffs. One innovative feature of the proposed loss allocation method is that, unlike other proposed approaches, it is irrespective of the reference bus selection and takes in consideration the impact of reactive flows on active power losses.

50|$|A 2014 {{news report}} stated that:Bangladesh is {{considered}} one of the most arousing energy growth nations. More than a third of Bangladesh's 166 million people still have no access to electricity, while the country often is able to produce only some of its 11,500-megawatt generation capacity.In generating and distributing electricity, the failure to adequately manage the load leads to extensive load shedding which results in severe disruption in the industrial production and other economic activities. A recent survey reveals that power outages result in a loss of industrial output worth $1 billion a year which reduces the GDP growth by about half a percentage point in Bangladesh. A major hurdle in efficiently delivering power is caused by the inefficient distribution system.

5000|$|Under the 2015 standard, for {{the first}} time, storage water heaters with {{capacities}} of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a 75 gal gas storage water heater with a nominal input of [...] or less was able to have an energy factor as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, {{which can only be}} achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a nominal input of 75,000 btu or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since energy factor is not defined for such units. An 80 gal electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum energy factor of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with heat pump technology. It should be noted that this efficiency rating measures efficiency at the point of use. Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30-35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity {{on the other end of}} the generator. Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation.

The controllers have to regulate voltage to the required level and manage energy flow in the system. In addition, they should maintain a deterministic time frame {{on the order of}} a few tens of milliseconds for a system with tens of power electronic converters with no limitation in the number of events which might happen concurrently. Optimal power sharing ensures minimum <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>loss</b> while enforcing constraints such as generators’ capacity limits. Multiple agents take part in the process to determine optimum power sharing for the converters. The thesis compares system complexity using numerical analysis of different distributed lookup algorithms based on defined metric values for a standalone DC microgrid including 32 converters. The numerical analysis results aid in choosing a publish-subscribe model as the most efficient and scalable solution for developing agent technology for standalone DC microgrids. Application of publish-subscribe agent-based control is presented for real-time coordination of power converters in a defined microgrid.

A reasonably fast calculation tool to facilitate the core loss optimization through accurate predetermination of the impact of different design parameters on its losses seems indispensable, for a transformer manufacturer.

Assuming the normal component of the magnetic field to be zero, this method reduces the computation time substantially in comparison with the available conventional methods (maintaining the same accuracy level). Employing Gaussian fitting curve, the anisotropic and the non-linear behavior of the magnetic core material are modeled. The extra core losses which occur in the core sheets joints and the stacking holes are simulated accurately in this work.

There is capacity shortage, high <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> (T&D) <b>losses,</b> inefficient pricing structures, costly and ineffective subsidies, circular debts and an inefficient resource mix in generation. These problems cause many and hours long system blackouts during {{day and night}} in Pakistan, thus inflicting impasse on daily life. These problems already existed before the 1990 s, the period that Pakistan reformed its power sector with the intention to solve these problems. But the problems weren’t solved by the institutional reforms. Therefore, we assumed {{in this study that}} the continuation of the poor functioning of Pakistan’s power sector is caused by poor and incomplete design of the institutional reform of the power sector and by the pace of implementation of the reforms. So, inspired by New Institutional Economics, this dissertation analyses the institutional causes of the problems to find an answer to the question why the institutional reforms of the Pakistan power sector did not result in the expected improvement of the organization and functioning of electricity supply in Pakistan. The study utilizes a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods to answer the overarching and its connected research questions. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework crafted from the work of Douglass North and Oliver Williamson (Nobel Laureates in Economics). The study holds that institutional barriers remained important in restraining the electricity reforms reducing the severity of the pre-reform problems of the power sector of Pakistan. This has contributed to the continuation of the pre-reform problems until recently.

There are various available favourable sites for the implementation of microgrids like remote areas, rural areas etc. where plenty of renewable energy resources are available for clean and green power generation. In such locations, microgrids can be operated in an islanding mode to achieve reliable and stable power supply by combining loads with the distributed energy resources available on the respected site. Based on market segments, microgrids can be categorized into five types: i) remote “off-grid” Microgrids ii) Campus/Institutional microgrids iii) Military base microgrids iv) Community/Utility microgrids and v) Commercial and Industrial microgrids [7]. Other way to categorize microgrid is based on the output voltage supplied to the load, and according to it microgrids can be classified into two types i) AC microgrid and ii) DC microgrid.

The remaining one third are based on oil fired thermal generation with varying technologies, such as oil steam, Diesel, gas turbines and combined cycle plants.

In addition to these, Sri Lanka presently has about 40 MWs of mini-hydro plants, which are distributed in the highlands and their surrounding districts, mainly connected to the primary distribution system. Further, {{there are a few}} attempts to build fuel wood fired power plants of small capacities and connect them to the grid {{in various parts of the}} country. The study presented in this paper investigates the impact of these new developments in the power sector on the overall emissions and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in particular.

The paper also examines the impact on emissions with 80 MWs of distributed power in different capacities of wind; mini-hydro and wood fired power plants. It is concluded that grid connected, distributed power generation (DPG) reduces emissions, with only a marginal increase in overall costs, due to the reduction in <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> network <b>losses</b> that result from the distributed nature of generation. These reductions can be enhanced by opting for renewable energy based DPGs, as the case presented in the paper, and coupling them with demand side management measures.
