The PTC's website includes the guide from the 1996-97 season at the earliest. Starting with the 2005–2006 season, their list was based on their <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> as well as Nielsen Media Research ratings of viewership among children ages 2–17 of certain shows. Popular shows that have frequently been praised as the most family-friendly programs on television include George Lopez, 7th Heaven, Touched by an Angel, Home Improvement, Family Matters, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Boy Meets World, , American Idol, Dancing with the Stars, NBC Sunday Night Football, Deal or No Deal, and [...] Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. [...] Popular shows frequently named [...] "Worst of the Season" [...] include American Dad!, , House, Two and a Half Men, Ally McBeal, Dawson's Creek, Grey's Anatomy, The Drew Carey Show, Family Guy, Friends, The O.C., Spin City, That '70s Show and Will and Grace.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue {{to recent}} {{advanced}} communication possibilities between traffic infrastructure, vehicles and drivers, the optimization of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> control can be approached in novel ways. At the same time, this may introduce new unexpected dynamics in transportation systems. Our research aims {{to determine how}} drivers and <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> <b>systems</b> interact and influence each other when they are informed one about another's behaviour. In order to study this, we developed an agent based model to simulate transportation systems with static and dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> and drivers using information about the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> behaviour. Experiments reveal that the system's performance improves when a bigger share of drivers receive information for both static and dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> <b>systems.</b> This performance improvement is due to drivers managing to avoid stopping at red light rather them adapting their speed to different distances to the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> <b>systems.</b> Additionally, it is demonstrated that {{the duration of the}} fixed phases also influences the performance when drivers use speed recommendations. Moreover, the results show that dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> can produce positive effects for roads with high speed limits and high traffic intensity, while {{in the rest of the}} cases static control is better. Our findings can be used for building more efficient <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
2500|$|This {{document}} format has been revised in 2010 {{to include an}} easy to assimilate format for the reader. [...] The problem with the earlier format often reported to RICS by clients in receipt of the previous 'Homebuyer's Survey and Valuation' was that the structure did not easily distinguish the faults from the main description. [...] A <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> was introduced and surveyors have to rate each element of the inspection according to priority. [...] In this way, serious impediments are identified easily, and less critical defects commented upon to give the reader advice on what will need attention in the near future. [...] It does {{not comment on the}} maintenance requirements for items found to be in satisfactory condition, only confirming that there is no cause for concern at this time. This format is suitable {{for a wide range of}} properties, but is best suited to traditionally built houses that are not subject to very serious distress or previous major alterations or extensions. This report is much longer than the condition report and looks in more detail at the property to report on the visual condition and maintenance needs of nine external elements of construction, nine internal elements of construction, seven services supplied to the building, and three key components of the grounds in which the property is sited. [...] The reports rates conditions from 1 - good, 2, - needing attention in the near future, 3 - needing attention now using a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> to draw attention to things that matter. The report also includes commentary to advise your solicitor on issues that need addressing in the conveyance, and any risks that affect the building, grounds and people of a more general nature. [...] There is also a market valuation of the property and an assessment of rebuilding costs for insurance purposes.|$|E

[...] The report also includes commentary to advise your solicitor on issues that need addressing in the conveyance, and any risks that affect the building, grounds and people of a more general nature. [...] There is also discussion on the means of escape in case of fire, which in older houses in particular can be compromised by poor design and alterations. [...] There is no market valuation or an assessment of rebuilding costs for insurance purposes in the document. [...] These can be added, along with cost estimates for the repairs by a separate agreement as discussed in the helpful RICS explanatory notes to clients.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{automated}} <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> is to safely and effectively manage {{the flow of}} vehicles through (usually) urban environments. Through the use of wireless-based communication protocols, sets of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> are increasingly being connected to larger systems and also being remotely accessed for management purposes, both for monitoring and emergency purposes. These protocols, however, were not designed with security as a primary requirement, thus systems may operate with sub-standard or non-existent security implementations. This research aims to test if the same issues and vulnerabilities {{that appear to be}} present in <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> in the USA are prevalent in Australia, specifically, Perth. There is evidence of weaknesses in traffic systems in Eastern Australia and by undertaking this research the conjecture that the same weaknesses may be present in Perth traffic systems can be answered.
