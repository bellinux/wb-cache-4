40|$|In a {{previous}} study, Huang et al. (2012) employed a spinning disc apparatus to study deposition of fats on cooled stainless steel surfaces using model solutions of tripalmitin in non-crystallising paraffin. The apparatus was modified {{to give more}} accurate estimation of the <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature,</b> allowing the surface temperature and shear stress to be manipulated independently. The effect of different starting modes, simulating various situations which arise in pipelines, was studied. When fouling is induced by a step change in the <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{the presence of a}} subcooled surface promotes the rapid formation, initially, of a gel layer, followed by a period of linear fouling, and eventually falling rate fouling behaviour. When fouling is driven by a change in concentration the initial gel formation step is absent. The linear fouling regime was relatively insensitive to temperature, shear stress and starting mode for the conditions studied here. In the falling rate regime, the rate was determined by the deposit/solution interface temperature, following normal growth kinetics. At low tripalmitin concentrations, of 2. 5 wt. %, sigmoidal growth behaviour was observed, which is attributed to the wall shear stress being initially high enough to disrupt the gel. As time proceeded, the gel increased in strength and was able to grow as before...|$|E

In this study the frost formation process on a flat plate with forced convection was experimentally investigated. A flat plate {{heat exchanger}} test loop was designed, built and tested. Air from the room passed over the cold test plate. Test conditions were limited to a <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> range from - 15 to - 5 °C, air humidity ratio range from 0. 004 to 0. 01 kg/kg, supply air temperature range from 15 to 23 °C, and inlet airflow Reynolds number range from 3000 to 7000 (ie. air velocity from 1. 15 to 2. 67 m/s). An innovative new method, using a laser-beam and light-meter for the measurement of frost thickness, was designed and calibrated with an accuracy of 0. 025 mm. Also, a newly designed method of measuring the local frost mass concentration (mass per unit area) was developed and tested. A calibrated heat-flux meter {{was used to measure}} the local heat flux along the test plate. Typical frost thickness, mass concentration and heat flux data are presented as a function of distance from the leading edge, humidity ratio of the inlet air, <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature,</b> inlet velocity (or Reynolds number), and time. Frost property data from more than 50 test runs are correlated against the five independent test variables using dimensionless variables. The coefficients of tolerance range from 0. 91 to 0. 96 for the independent variables over the range of test conditions. These data and correlations are discussed and compared with other available data in the literature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{improved}} calorimeter cryostat for MLI {{thermal performance}} measurements {{has been designed}} and put into operation at the TU Dresden. Based on a liquid helium cooled flow cryostat, it allows the setting of any cold level temperature between approx. 30 K and ambient temperature. Thermal shields and all-embracing radiation guards at both ends can be kept at nearly identical temperature. This is done by means of two separate cooling circuits. Both the actual cold <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and the cooling of the mechanical support and radiation shields can be independently controlled. Insulation specimens are wrapped around a test cylinder with a surface of 0. 9 m 2. The heat transfer through the MLI is measured by recording the mass flow and the inlet and outlet temperature of the cooling fluid. Measurements both in horizontal and vertical orientation can be performed or compared, respectively. Moreover the effect of an additional vacuum degradation as it might occur by decreasing getter material performance in real systems at elevated temperatures can be studied by controlled inlet of an elective gas. It is reported about the design and the equipment of this cryostat and measurements of a 10 layer MLI specimen...|$|E

30|$|The heating {{sections}} {{were made of}} 7.4  mm[*]×[*] 7.4  mm, double-side polished, 490 -μm-thick silicon dies. Chromium, platinum, and titanium (thickness proportions of approximately 1 : 10 : 1) were applied to the bottom surface of the silicon dies using positive photoresist lift-off in a serpentine pattern with a total thickness of 241  nm. A 150 -nm-thick PECVD SiO 2 film was also added {{on top of the}} metals for electrical passivation. Four platinum heaters were arranged in serpentine patterns on the bottom surface of each silicon die to reduce the voltage input for safety considerations with each platinum resistance being 300 ~ 400  Ω. The SiO 2 film and the titanium were removed on the eight pads by wet etching to expose the platinum before the silicon die was mounted on a temperature-resistant PCB circuit board. Eight 40 -μm gold wires connected the four platinum heaters with the circuit board by wire bonding. A DC-stabilized voltage source was then used to supply power to the platinum heaters through the eight wires soldered to the circuit board. The currents in each wire were also measured so that the resistances of the platinum heaters could be calculated to determine the heater temperature. Thus, the serpentine platinum heaters acted as the heaters and RTDs. The heat flux was calculated by dividing the input power by the surface area. As the input power increased, surface temperature increased, and at a certain point, <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> increased rapidly and the test sample was burning out. This point was defined as the critical heat flux (CHF) point.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{details the}} development, {{validation}} {{and use of}} a thermal model created for the UK Ministry of Defence funded Sustained Hypersonic Flight Experiment (SHyFE). This compact ramjet will operate at Mach 4 to 6 leading to very high air flow stagnation temperatures. The thermal management system must be designed to maintain the avionics and fuel system at acceptable temperatures throughout the flight. The heat exchange mechanisms were predicted throughout the acceleration section of the final SHyFE flight experiment using a thermal resistance network approach which incorporates convection, radiation and conduction. This allowed the SHyFE thermal management system to be assessed at an early design stage before the vehicle geometry was finalised and before detailed CAD models were available. The resulting thermal model is highly flexible which allows changes in geometry to be easily incorporated and assessed. The thermal model of the SHyFE vehicle during flight was validated using SHyFE Mach 4 combustion ground <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements. The flexibility of the model allowed the combustion chamber and nozzle ground experiment thermal systems to be predicted using the same methodology as the flight experiment. The predicted combustor exit gas temperatures show good agreement with the measured ground experiment exit gas temperatures providing confidence in the thermal modelling technique. The Mach 4 combustion test thermal models were used to aid {{the design of the}} ground experiment cooling water system and to assess the reliability of experiment high temperature instrumentation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{tempered}} glass {{is widely used}} in the buildings because of its good transparence and fire endurance {{under the protection of}} the sprinkler. The fire backdraft may occur under the good ventilation condition after the {{tempered glass}}es fall apart in fire, which can endanger the human evacuation and fire rescue. By the <b>testing</b> of the <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of the tempered glass exposed to the building fire, the critical temperature of the glass fracture can be acquired and the basis for the prediction and prevention of the fracture of the tempered glass then can be provided, which is useful for the performance-based design of the fire safety. The infrared imaging equipment is firstly used in China for the research on the fire endurance of the tempered glass...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the data fusion of visible and near {{infrared}} (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery. VNIR image gives high spatial resolution and clear edge expression information while TIR image gives Earth’s <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> information. Frequently, {{it is not}} easy to utilize the TIR images in many remote sensing applications, because the TIR images does not have a good spatial resolution enough to describe spatial details. Thus, in order to improve the TIR image’s availability and utilization, a multi-sensor data fusion of TIR and VNIR is quite necessary. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient way to fuse the VNIR and TIR images of Landsat 5 TM and ASTER. The panchromatic images is generated by using principal component analysis (PCA) from multi-spectral images, and the fused image is created by merging the panchromatic and thermal images. And finally, the performance test of the proposed fusion method is performed by using entropy concept. The method can be applied to detect hot-spot area such as forest fire and investigate a nuclear <b>test</b> and a <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> change in urban area...|$|R
3000|$|Due to the {{existence}} of the coating layer {{on the surface of the}} fiber Bragg grating sensor, there is about a 0.15 mm gap between the machine tool surface and the fiber Bragg grating temperature sensing point. In the temperature gradient of − 46.4 °C/mm, the small space is sufficient to produce a large temperature test error. By using thermal conductive paste, the uniformity of the <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> can be improved, and the error of the <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement by FBG can be significantly reduced compared to that from a commercial thermal resistance <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor. Ref. [96] studied influence of the installation types on <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement by a FBG sensor. The <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement error of the FBG sensor with single-ended fixation, double-ended fixation and fully-adhered fixation are theoretical analyzed and experimental studied. The single-ended fixation results in a positive linear error with increasing <b>surface</b> <b>temperature,</b> while the double-ended fixation and fully-adhered fixation both result in non-linear error with increasing <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> that are affected by thermal expansion strain of the <b>tested</b> <b>surface’s</b> material. Due to its linear error and strain-resistant characteristics, the single-ended fixation will play an important role in the FBG <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor encapsulation design field [...].|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} a {{portable}} apparatus for the nondestructive {{identification of defects}} in structures. The apparatus comprises a heat source and a thermal imager that move at a constant speed past a <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> of a structure. The thermal imager is off set at a predetermined distance from the heat source. The heat source induces a constant <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> The imager follows the heat source and produces a video image of the thermal characteristics of the <b>test</b> <b>surface.</b> Material defects produce deviations from the constant <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> that move at the inverse of the constant speed. Thermal noise produces deviations that move at random speed. Computer averaging of the digitized thermal image data {{with respect to the}} constant speed minimizes noise and improves the signal of valid defects. The motion of thermographic equipment coupled with the high signal to noise ratio render it suitable for portable, on site analysis...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{statistical}} methods {{to the problem}} of identifying those material properties of artificial graphite having the strongest effect on ablation performance. Ablation performance, as determined by total length change during <b>test,</b> recession rate, <b>surface</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>surface</b> texture, and degree of gouging, was measured on 40 different, commercially available, artificial graphites in a Mach 2 airstream having a nominal enthalpy of 2. 2 MJ/kg and a stagnation pressure of 5. 6 atm. Eighteen material properties were measured on these same graphites, and correlations between pairs of these material properties were developed where possible, reducing the original 18 properties to ten mutually independent properties. Multiple regression equations were formulated relating ablation performance to the reduced set of ten independent material properties, thereby identifying those material properties having the most pronounced effect on ablation performance. These regression equations reveal that for optimum ablation performance in the present environment, grain size should be small, ash content low, density and thermal conductivity high, and mean pore radius large...|$|R
40|$|Moderate-Resolution Imaging {{spectroradiometer}} (MODIS) land <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in Antarctica were {{processed in}} order to produce a gridded data set at 25 km resolution, spanning the period 2000 – 2011 at an hourly time step. The Aqua and Terra orbits and MODIS swath width, combined with frequent clear-sky conditions, lead to very high availability of quality-controlled observations: on average, hourly data are available 14 h per day at the grid points around the South Pole and more than 9 h over a large area of the Antarctic Plateau. Processed MODIS land <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures,</b> referred to hereinafter as MODIS T s values, were compared with in situ hourly measurements of <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> collected over the entirety of the year 2009 by seven stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and automatic weather stations (AWSs). In spite of an occasional failure in the detection of clouds, MODIS T s values exhibit a good performance, with a bias ranging from − 1. 8 to 0. 1 °C and errors ranging from 2. 2 to 4. 8 °C root mean square at the five stations located on the plateau. These results show that MODIS T s values {{can be used as a}} precise and accurate reference to <b>test</b> other <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> data sets. Here, we evaluate the performance of <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis known as ERA-Interim reanalysis. During conditions detected as cloud free by MODIS, ERA-Interim shows a widespread warm bias in Antarctica in every season, ranging from + 3 to + 6 °C on the plateau. This confirms a recent study which showed that the largest discrepancies in 2 m air temperature between ERA-Interim and the global temperature data set HadCRUT 4 compiled by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit occur in Antarctica. A comparison with in situ <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> shows that this bias is not strictly limited to clear-sky conditions. A detailed comparison with stand-alone simulations by the Crocus snowpack model, forced by ERA-Interim, and with the ERA-Interim/land simulations, shows that the warm bias may be due primarily to an overestimation of the surface turbulent fluxes in very stable conditions. Numerical experiments with Crocus show that a small change in the parameterization of the effects of stability on the surface exchange coefficients can significantly impact the snow <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> The ERA-Interim warm bias appears to be likely due to an overestimation of the surface exchange coefficients under very stable conditions...|$|R
