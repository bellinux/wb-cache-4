40|$|Before the 20 th century {{there were}} few seismometers. So Earth’s dynamic {{geophysical}} processes were poorly un-derstood. Today the potential for understanding those processes is enormous: the number of seismic instruments is continually increasing, their data are easily stored and shared, and computing power grows exponentially. As a re-sult, seismologists are rapidly discovering new kinds of seis-mic signals in the frequency range 0. 001 – 100 Hz, as well as relatively large nonseismic displacements, monitored by the global positioning system, occurring over days or weeks. Such new signals manifest geophysical events very dif-ferent from classical earthquakes. A classical earthquake oc-curs when one crustal block slips past another at a fault sur-face (see <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> **).

This was the largest change in average expenditures in several years; however, there were changes to the survey in 2004, and the estimates for average annual expenditures {{and some of the}} components are not strictly comparable to estimates for previous years. (See <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 4 for information on the changes.) The increase in expenditures from 2003 to 2004 was more than the 2. 7 -percent rise in the annual average Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period.

40|$|The ever-greater {{integration}} {{of new technologies}} in work equipment is regarded by some as the fourth industrial revolution 1 and referred to as ‘smart industry’ 2. Examples {{that come to mind}} include automation through the use of embedded software, remotely controlling heavy materials, and the connecting of work equipment to local and public networks such as the internet (for some examples, see <b>the</b> text <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 6). As well as the opportunities this entails for industry, new threats are also presenting themselves. This includes employees who have to move among robots or autonomous freight vehicles, but also malicious actors who can penetrate computers and computer networks and thereby disrupt processes or bring them to a standstill.

40|$|The U. S. {{labor market}} {{continued}} to improve slowly in 2012 as unemployment trended downward and employment grew. In {{the fourth quarter}} of the year, 12. 2 million people were unemployed and the unemployment rate was 7. 8 percent, nearly a full percentage point lower than a year earlier. Total civilian employment grew at a faster pace in 2012 than in 2011. (For a comparison of the employment measures available from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Current Employment Statistics survey (CES), see <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 4.) Still, even with the modest improvement in the job market, a number of labor market problems persisted. For example, the proportion of unemployed people who had been without work for 6 months or longer remained close to historically high levels. This article takes a detailed look at changes in key labor market measures from the CPS in 2012 by various demographic characteristics. Among the measures examined are earnings, unemployment duration, and the employment situations of veterans, people with a disability, and the foreign born...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{bullying}} {{in schools}} has gained consider-able media attention with reports of high profile shootings in schools by students who subsequently report having been humiliated {{on a regular}} basis by their peers. While these extreme occurrences are rare, the association of these events with bullying has prompted researchers to question how common bullying is and how it affects targeted children and adolescents. (For a definition and discussion of the terms “bullying ” and “harassment”, see <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 14). National studies have found that: • 8 % of 6 th- 10 th graders nationally say they are bullied once a week or more (Nansel, 2001). • 68 % of 12 to 15 year-old students describe teasing and bullying as a “big problem ” for people their age (Nickel-odeon/Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001). • 90 % of those bullied report psychological conse-quences, including a drop in grades, increased anxiety, and loss of friends or social life (Glew, 2000). This issue of Data Watch recognizes bullying and harassment as a major public health problem which is both widespread and potentially a serious threat to {{the health and well-being of}} children and youth living in King County. The information comes primarily from two sources. General countywide and state data concerning experiences commonly associated with bullying (e. g., object of rumors or lies, called names or insulted, shoved/ pushed, threatened with physical harm) are from the Washington State Survey of Adolescent Health Behav-iors (WSSAHB) which was conducted in the fall of 2000. Information con-cerning bias-based harassment (based on gender, race/ethnicity, and perceived sexual orientation) comes from the Seattle Teen Health Survey which was conducted in Seattle Publi...|$|E
40|$|Since 1950 China has {{transformed}} {{itself from the}} sick man of Asia' to a country with better than average health indices for its level of national income. This achievement was due {{to a number of}} factors including a dramatic fall in the prevalence of severe poverty, improvements in the rural environment, increases in levels of literacy and the provision of services to meet priority health needs. The development of the health sector paralleled the establishment of a command economy organised into state-owned enterprises in the cities and agricultural collectives, called communes, in the countryside. Its structure reflected this economic and administrative environment. It was controlled jointly by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Communist Party through a tightly organised hierarchy. The health services mobilised the population in public health campaigns and provided almost universal access to preventive programmes and basic curative care. During the late 1970 s the government began to introduce market-oriented reforms and devolve its financial management. For several years the School of Public Health of the Shanghai Medical University, in collaboration with the Institute of Development Studies in England, has been studying the impact of these changes on rural health services. This paper outlines the problems which health services in poor rural counties face and proposes a strategy for reform. The major points it makes are summarised in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 2 and the research findings which led to these recommendations are presented in the Annex. The aim is to contribute to the formulation of strategies which ensure that the population of poor rural areas has access to essential health services...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} that every {{book of the}} Hebrew Bible except Esther has been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Actually, this is true only if you count Ezra-Nehemiah as one book-as, indeed, it is so {{regarded}} in Jewish tradition- since only a fragment of Ezra, but not Nehemiah, has been identified. But why not Esther? Some have suggested theological reasons: Esther is not a particularly religious book; it lacks any interest in Judah and its cultic institutions; {{and it has a}} sympathetic view toward the gentile King Ahasuerus. Moreover, it is the only book of the Hebrew Bible that does not mention the name of God. Others have suggested that it 2 ̆ 7 s a matter of happenstance. There may well have been a copy or copies of Esther among the scrolls, but they did not survive. In 1992 the direction of the discussion drastically changed, for in that year J. T. Milik published a fragmentary (as usual) text he claimed was a model or source for the book of Esther. He denominated the text proto-Esther and tried to show that there was a relationship of direct dependency between the text from Qumran, where the scrolls were discovered, and the text found in the Hebrew Bible. Is Milik right? We {{are going to look at}} the text quite carefully before deciding. But whatever the answer, our exploration of this text will tell us a lot about how Dead Sea Scroll scholars work. A translation of the four fragments of the Qumran text is printed in <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>pages</b> 31 - 33. A glance will show that they are extremely fragmentary, with much more missing than preserved. If you read the text at this point, it is unlikely to make any sense. So our initial task will be to try to squeeze some meaning out of it. You may be surprised at how much we will find...|$|R

50|$|Once {{a course}} {{has been cleared}} in Story Mode, it will become {{available}} for play in Trial Mode.

There are multiple ways to increase one's score, the most casual being a melon quest. With this goal in mind, the player seeks to find and eat the 30 melons that are scattered across every course. However, most of the melons are hidden and tied to various secrets. In addition, most of the courses also feature a mini game that will put seven melons at stake, further increasing the risk of failure, as the player must win every piece.|$|R
40|$|For decades now, robots {{have been}} {{a key part of}} future visions in films and books. As long ago as 1920, Karel Čapek wrote a play called RUR (Rossum’s Universal Robots). The first real robot, ‘Gargantuan’, was {{constructed}} between 1935 and 1937. It was made completely out of Meccano. Today’s industrial robots strongly resemble those introduced on General Motors’ car production lines in 19612. In the past fifty years, robots have become much faster and more accurate, but in many cases they do no more than operate in one particular location or on rails, automatically carrying out perhaps only a single task within a fixed hazardous zone or inside a safety cage. <b>The</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next <b>page</b> shows several examples of the application of modern-day industrial robots in different sectors. These robots are still {{a far cry from the}} intelligent and autonomous robots described in science-fiction films and books.

40|$|Susan was 7 {{years old}} when she was hit by a car while riding her bike. She broke her arm and leg. She also hit her head very hard. The doctors say she {{sustained}} a traumatic brain injury. When she came home from the hospital, she needed lots of help, but now she looks fine. In fact, that’s part of the problem, especially at school. Her friends and teachers think her brain has healed because her broken bones have. But there are changes in Susan that are hard to understand. It takes Susan longer to do things. She has trouble remembering things. She can’t always find the words she wants to use. Reading is hard for her now. It’s going to take time before people really understand the changes they see in her.

40|$|Midway {{through my}} year as President of our Division, I {{am pleased to}} report that we are making {{progress}} {{on a number of}} fronts. First and foremost at this time, the subcom-mittee on Branding has created a proposal for the name change of our Division that clarifies and accurately reflects our mission. You should already have received via email the information and ballot describing the change and the justification for it. It is also described in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>on</b> this <b>page.</b> Please make sure that you send in your vote by July 18 th, so that we may move forward on this important development. This name change will accurately reflect the broad range of activities in media psychology and technology that members of our Division have been involved in over the past several years. Hopefully, that will serve to expand our membership and revitalize our mission for all of us. Speaking of our mission, one of the major aspects of that which I mentioned in my last Newsletter article is the area of media ethics. In this regard, we have started work on a Media Ethics Casebook and will continue to work on it throughout the rest of this year. If you are interested in contributing to this effort, please contact com-mittee chairs Linda Berg-Cross or June Wilson, who have already begun to organize the project. More work needs to be done on this valuable and timely project, and we welcome your participation. An important element of media ethics is civil discourse in all areas of the media. That will be the subject of my Presidential Address at the 2012 APA Convention. Our Past President, Pauline Wallin, and our President-Elect, Mary Alvord, along with a local journalist, will join me to discuss this important issue for our Division and for all of psychology. In working as a Presidential Trio this year, the three of us have been a living example of civil discourse in action. We have supported each other throughout the year on numerous topics, even when we disagreed. Our differences of opinion have only served to enrich our decision-making and contribution to th...|$|R
