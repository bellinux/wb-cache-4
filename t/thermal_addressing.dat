40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{has become a}} ‘hot’ field in recent years due to a need to obtain high performance levels in many devices used in such diverse areas as space science, mainframe and desktop computers, optoelectronics and even Formula One racing cars! Thermal solutions require not just taking care of very high thermal flux, but also ‘hot spots’, where the flux densities can exceed 200 W/cm 2. High thermal conductivity materials {{play an important role}} in <b>addressing</b> <b>thermal</b> management issues. This volume provides readers a basic understanding of the thermal conduction mechanisms in these materials and discusses how the thermal conductivity may be related to their crystal structures as well as microstructures developed as a result of their processing history. The techniques for accurate measurement of these properties on large as well as small scales have been reviewed. Detailed information on the thermal conductivity of diverse materials including aluminum nitride (AlN), silicon carbide (SiC), diamond, as well as carbon nanotubes has been presented. The emphasis is on developing basic understanding of the inter-relationships between thermal conductivity and processing such that the readers can conduct their own research in this exciting field of high thermal conductivity materials. Engineers and scientists involved in <b>addressing</b> <b>thermal</b> management issues in a broad spectrum of industries should find this book a valuable resource in their work...|$|R

Higher order contributions leads to a stochastic interpretation for the effective action in analogy to Quantum Brownian Motion, resulting in dissipation and decoherence for the evolution of the soft modes.

30|$|<b>Thermal</b> profile 3 <b>addresses</b> the {{importance}} of basin geometry through topography, where at approximately[*]~[*] 35  km along the profile line, high topography {{has resulted in a}} local increase in sedimentary cover, together with coal providing additional insulation. The top of the basement within the western half of thermal profile 3 is very shallow in comparison with the eastern half of the profile. Again, elevated 150  °C isotherms are associated with both sediment and coal thickness, and distance {{to the top of the}} basement. The latter effect is a function of both the high concentration of radiogenic elements in the basement rocks, generating significant heat (Blevin et al. 2010), and the relatively high conductivity of crystalline basement.|$|R
