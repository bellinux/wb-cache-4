40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} Quest, a <b>telematic</b> <b>tool</b> that automates the management of student questionnaires that serve to collect the basic data for our educational research. The aim of the tool is to make easier {{for the students to}} fill the questionnaires and to facilitate the researchers to process the answers with qualitative or quantitative software packages. The tool is then offered through the WWW, with a client-server design. The telematic design is constrained {{by the fact that the}} response time should be limited for the operations carded out by the students, and independent of the number of students using the tool, which in turn requires to reduce the traffic over the network. Quest has been used for a semester in our educational research, providing more student satisfaction, which improves their implication with the research, and reducing the burden on the researcher to process the collected data...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} this work, if {{the use of}} a simulation <b>telematic</b> <b>tool,</b> specific and previously chosen, enhances academic studies efficiently. In addition the use of these tools allows us to step beyond theory, manually configure the devices as well as overview how to manage telematic devices. To achieve the objective of this work, we propose studying diferent mechanisms of layer 2 in a simulated environment. The mechanisms studied are: Spanning-Tree, VLANs and Link Aggregation. Each mecanisn consists of a chapter. First a brief theoretical introduction to proposes a network topology. Once we have created the network at simulator, we apply a basic settings to devices. The tests allow us verifies the correct operation of the mechanism. If the results are satisfactory and the simulator allows us, we apply an advanced configuration of this mechanisms to different devices. To end each chapter we will present a comparison between the obtained results and the expected results. Also we present all the problems and limitations we have encountered during the study. To conclude the work, will assess whether the objective has been achieved and the use of this simulation tool can strengthen the theoretical knowledge...|$|E

40|$|A bimodal {{education}} {{model is}} a flexible model which harmoniously combines the possibilities for teaching offered by Information Society Technologies (IST), such as interactive classrooms, videoconference, and the virtual campus, with traditional educational activities such as lectures and certain types of practical training. The main goal was to provide university students and teachers in formal and continuing education with <b>telematic</b> <b>tools</b> based on new information technologies {{within the framework of}} a bimodal educational system. Other objectives were to evaluate the possibility of shortening and improving the learning cycles and overcoming the physical barriers that make it difficult for students to contact their tutor. This paper describes the development of a virtual campus based on a bimodal model of university education, in which the educational possibilities of IST were combined with the traditional training activities. Five virtual education sections were designed: Formal Education courses, Global Campus, Masters and Postgraduate courses, Specialised Education courses, and the Thematic Portal.

40|$|Abstract: When {{engaging}} in collaborative knowledge construction, geographically distributed groups {{are found to}} have additional problems in comparison with groups working face-to-face. Telematic services have been created to address these problems, but {{so far they have}} not resolved all the difficulties. One of several reasons may be that too little consideration is given to the match between the tool and the process it is intended to support. Thus, this chapter first describes some functionalities of <b>telematic</b> <b>tools,</b> then offers two typical present-day examples of collaborative knowledge construction by groups that use such tools (one a case of project pedagogy distance learning, another a case of international research collaboration). A promising framework for understanding collaborative and tool-mediated human effort is the dialectically systemic approach of Activity Theory, which originated with Vygotsky's cultural-historical school of psychology in the 1920 s and is presently being further developed by Yrjö Engeström, amongst others. Aspects of this theory are outlined and used as a framework to further the understanding of some processes and problems that were reported by the case studies. 1...|$|R

40|$|In present time, one of {{the most}} {{repeated}} slogans in education and training, talks about the omnipresence of the education. Concepts like “permanent learning ” and “Lifelong learning ” are reiterative in the documents about plans and perspectives of future of education. In this way, most of the students and graduate’s (and in general people in formation processes) information and knowledge come from informal learning processes, through no-formal and informal educational means. “Learning Together ” is {{one of the}} most fashionable and frequently used terms in educational literature in recent years. Because today, the work collaboration processes are probably one of our most important knowledge sources and our challenge is to contribute to maximum performance and to enrich our possibilities, inside and outside our classrooms. In this paper, the authors want to use this previous framework to explain certain kinds of collaboration. In spite of this focus, it is important to note than <b>telematic</b> <b>tools</b> are not specific or exclusive to one kind of collaboration. We can classify them in one or another collaboration model, but this classification is useful only in theory, to talk about them (for the purpose of discussion). However, in practice the tool doesn’t determine the collaboration model, rather the collaboration model determines the most suitable kind of tool. Resumen...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of knowing ICT training and motivation -so relevant in today's society- which currently offers {{the first year}} college students, mostly in degrees in Education, focuses the object {{of interest in this}} study. The following targets have been proposed: [1] knowing what basic skills regarding initial instrumental knowledge presents the prospective teacher (aptitudes) and [2] knowing their motivation for the educational use of ICT in the classroom (attitudes). For this purpose a non-experimental descriptive quantitative methodology has been used, with a sample of subjects (N= 282) of the Autonomous Region of Extremadura (Spain). The results show that new degree college students possess a basic knowledge of ICT alongside a highly positive motivation towards the use of these. However, it is worrying that they only show an instrumental and technical knowledge of computing and <b>telematic</b> <b>tools</b> implied in social environments, but not pedagogical ones. Also they are unfamiliar with the true power of social, economic, political, ethical, influence as well as the effects and problems that their misuse can generate in their future students (addictions, manipulation, consumerism, etc.). Dimensions therefore for which they are urged to be trained at University for a proper performance as future professionals in education. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the most relevant}} results obtained {{in a survey of}} professors from the University of A Corunna (belonging to various scientific fields) who use e-learning systems to complement their lecture classes (Cohen and Manion, 1990). One of the main objectives of the survey was to identify the level of use made by lecturers of <b>telematic</b> applications and <b>tools</b> for teletraining systems. Based on the results from this research we can say that electronic mail is the most used tool (average 3. 72), while podcast (average 1. 34), audio conference (average 1. 42) and CMS (average 1. 42) are the least used. Inferential analyses of the lecturers at the University of A Coruña showed that there are personal (such as age) and professional variables (experience with virtual environments and position) that significantly influence their use of communication <b>tools,</b> <b>telematic</b> applications and communication tools within e-learning systems...|$|R
40|$|Telemedicine {{falls under}} the broader term of eHealth and {{involves}} the delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor. Thanks to telemedicine patients can access treatments {{that would otherwise be}} unavailable. The authors focus on whether doctor-patient relationship exist in telemedicine and mobile health. The answer should be found on a case-by-case basis. There is a doctor-patient relationship when the two are connected, possibly electronically, for purposes related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases. But the doctor-patient relationship is absent when the patient downloads apps to self diagnose rather than seeing a doctor. These apps encourage the use of ‘DIY’ medicine, making the doctor superfluous and can often lead to misdiagnosis and misunderstanding. Informed consent to the use of telemedicine should have the same prerequisites as those used in traditional medical practice. However, telemedicine requires some additional information: risks related to the privacy of personal data and precautionary measures to reduce them; further risks involved in the use of technology (for example, quality and efficiency of the <b>telematic</b> <b>tools).</b> With regards to the processing of personal data in mobile health, informed consent should be even more specific than that for medical treatment via telemedicine. In order to respect the requirement of specificity, the app should be structured in a way that allows the user to express consent for each type of data that the app intends to collect. But such a solution presents various difficulties. In conclusion, direct contact between a doctor and their patient should continue to be the preferred practice with which to carry out the relationship. Telemedicine can be used when it is deemed to be {{in the best interest of}} the patient, for example when it can offer the possibility of surgical treatment otherwise unavailable, or where contact is not possible. ...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho descreve o processo de reformulação de um sítio criado em 1996 para prestar assessoria a {{professor}}es de Química do Ensino Médio. Tratase do sítio do Laboratório de Pesquisas em Ensino em Química (LPEQ), do Instituto de Química (IQ), da Universidade de Brasília (UnB), que é parte do Projeto Integração Universidade-Escola, em vigência há 19 anos na instituição. A reformulação foi motivada pelo fato de o professor responsável pelo sítio mostrar-se insatisfeito com seus resultados. Segundo ele, embora houvesse acessos bastantes ao sítio, ele parecia não oferecer condições que motivassem os professores do Ensino Médio a se engajarem num processo de reflexão sobre questões relativas ao ensino de Química. O processo de reformulação foi guiado, principalmente, pela ideia de que a configuração do sítio anterior retratava muito mais a era da prevalência do texto do que a nova era em que acabamos de adentrar, a das imagens técnicas. Assim, ao reconfigurá-lo, privilegiou-se a inclusão de novas ferramentas telemáticas ao sítio. Todavia, após apresentá-lo com a nova configuração, verificou-se que não se modificou o padrão dos contatos. O processo de reformulação com os resultados conseguidos a partir da nova configuração do sítio ensejou uma reflexão sobre a nova era que se inicia: a era em que o homem cria a ferramenta capaz de modificar-se. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work {{describes the}} process of remodeling a website that was created in 1996 {{in order to provide}} advice to High School Chemistry teachers. This website belongs to Laboratory for Research in Chemistry Teaching (LPEQ), at the Chemistry Institute of University of Brasília (UnB), which is part of University-School Integration Project, which has been taking place at this institution for 19 years.

According to him, even though the website had plenty of hits, it seemed not to offer conditions that motivated High School teachers to engage in a reflection on issues related to Chemistry teaching. The remodeling process was mainly guided by the idea that the configuration of the previous site stand for the text prevalence era than the new era that we have just got in, the era of technical images.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{opportunities}} of improving the testing and verification phases of product development in the automotive industry, {{through a combination of}} broadband <b>telematic</b> services and <b>tools</b> and methods for distributed collaborative engineering. The development of a prototype system for remote vehicle testing is described, and experiences from experimental usage of the system at an automotive winter testing facility are reported. The prototype system supports real time communication of audio, video and measurement data from a vehicle at a test track, to a remote location such as an automotive company's development site. Initial results from using the system are promising, indicating a clear potential of improving the testing and verification phases of product development within the automotive sector, which will be essential in the future in order to meet demands on shortened development cycles and increased testing needs.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos en febrero de 2006. Director de la Tesis: Jesús M. González-BarahonaWith the {{appearance}} and implantation of Internet {{new ways of}} developing software have arisen that make use of <b>telematic</b> <b>tools,</b> follow flexible methodologies and incorporate third-party contributions. One of the paradigmatic examples of software development that counts on the aforementioned characteristics {{can be found in}} the phenomenon of libre (free/open source) software, being of special special interest those projects that are large in number of participants and in software size. Although at first these new environments are less controllable than traditional ones (because development is done generally in a geographically distributed way, there is no a company behind the development that takes the lead, traditional hierarchic structures are not followed or external contributions are hardly predictable), we have access to much information: the software product itself and many of the by-products that are created during the development process (communication archives, bug-tracking systems and versioning systems, among others). These data sources are usually publicly available on the Internet, so we can make exhaustive analysis with a great amount of data (much of which is hardly obtainable in traditional, industrial environments). The goal of this thesis is to identify the data sources that libre software projects offer publicly, to present and display some methodologies for the analysis of these sources and the data that we can extract from them, and to show the results that have been obtained from applying these methodologies. Our intention is, in particular, to know the libre software phenomenon better, but also in general software creation processes since the acquired knowledge does not have to be specific to libre software, but could be applied to many other development environments. Thus, we will start in this thesis with the description of the publicly available data sources on the Internet and the data that we can extract from them. Afterwards, several methods, that will depend on the source, will be used to obtain information from the data and to filter out interferences. Finally, several methodologies will be presented and applied on the data obtained from libre software projects which have been selected as case studies. The methodologies will range from classical to novel ones. Thus, among the classical we will perform an analysis of the growth of the software systems as it is known from software evolution, or we will apply social network analysis, a technique from the field of social sciences. In both cases, the contribution of this thesis has been to apply them to libre software projects. Regarding novel methodologies, we propose the archaeological analysis of software systems with the aim of stating what remains from previous versions, the generalization of software evolution to file types different from source code (for instance, documentation, translation or user interface files, among others) or the study of the evolution of volunteer participation and the regeneration of the leading ¿core¿ group. Also, a series of tools have been created to automate, at least partially, the whole process. These tools permits to reuse these methodologies on other projects. Among the main contributions of this thesis we can state that this is the first exhaustive analysis of a large number of software projects, although the proposed methodologies and the tools that have been developed allow the study in the next future of more projects. On the other hand, we have shown that the technical analysis should be complemented with socio-technical analysis to fully understand the development process and many of the technical issues of (libre) software projects.
