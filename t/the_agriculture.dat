In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's management of the vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E

The requirements which are invested in this study are the so called 'common nature and landscape values' formulated by the Nature and Landscape Department of <b>the</b> Ministery of <b>Agriculture,</b> Nature and Fisheries. Aim of this study is to compare the actual situation of <b>the</b> organic <b>agriculture</b> with <b>the</b> desired situation by the government. Therefore an overview of the literature has been made, which shows that organic agriculture has a positive impact on the desired "common nature values", compared with <b>the</b> conventional <b>agriculture.</b> But it makes also clear that there is much to little information to make a clear statement. Therefore a general inventory of the "common nature and landscape values" on organic farms is recommended...|$|R

5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region.
