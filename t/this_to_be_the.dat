5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew {{the next day and}} confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and many historians consider <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made an arm of British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E
