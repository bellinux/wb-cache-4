5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|Following these sessions, Norman went to Kingston, Jamaica {{and spent}} {{more than half a}} year there, working in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Marley and {{composing}} songs. A number of his compositions were recorded by Marley, Peter Tosh, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and Neville Willoughby. Some of the tapes recorded by Norman during his sessions with Marley have been commercially released as part of the Marley compilation album, Soul Almighty.|$|E

The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the match meant it was selected for live broadcast by ITV across their entire network, with on-site presentation by Jim Rosenthal, by then one of ITV Sport's main presenters, who shared <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Jimmy Greaves. Two separate commentary teams were used: one, consisting of ITV's senior commentator Brian Moore, Terry Yorath and Ian St. John, covered the game for the English and Welsh regions of the network, while the other, with Jock Brown and Joe Jordan, was for viewers in the Scottish ITV areas.|$|E
5|$|The set {{depicting}} Katsuki Manor {{was based}} on the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. These sets are decorated with props evocative of feudal-era aristocrats, such as kimono and armor, personally chosen by Mizoguchi. The scene where the protagonists travel through Lake Biwa on a boat was in fact shot on a pool in <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>with</b> added smoke. The assistant directors had to push the boat through the cold waters. Miyagawa identified this as one of the scenes shot from a crane.|$|E
5|$|Thrice re-entered <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> {{producer}} Brian McTernan {{to record}} its Hopeless/Sub City debut, The Illusion of Safety. The album {{was released in}} February 2002 and the band toured extensively to support it, opening for Further Seems Forever and Face to Face before embarking on its first headlining tour later that year. The band again donated {{a portion of the}} album's proceeds, this time choosing a non-profit youth shelter in South Central Los Angeles, A Place Called Home. The band's donations were matched by their label.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Christmas decorations, Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013 Max Cavalera stated {{his intent}} {{to begin work}} on a new Cavalera Conspiracy album in 2014, which will be {{predominantly}} grindcore. Igor then implied on October 1 that the album could consist solely of the two brothers, without involvement from Marc Rizzo or Johny Chow, with the album produced by James Murphy. However this was proven false when Max's wife Gloria announced the trio of Max, Igor and Marc entering <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> producer John Gray in late December 2013, along with the announcement on 31 December of Nate Newton of Converge as the band's new bassist.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band {{had been working on}} new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 2014, wife of Max Bemis, Sherri DuPree-Bemis {{published}} an instagram photo {{stating that the}} new Say Anything album is almost mixed. The band's record, Hebrews, was released June 10, 2014 on Equal Vision Records. The album was the first album that was self-produced by front-man Max Bemis. Bemis worked in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> audio engineer Garron DuPree for many months while recording the album at Bemis and Dupree's own studio in Tyler, TX. The album was mixed by mix engineer Brad Wood, and mastered by Emily Lazar. It returned to the collaborative nature of the band's earlier material, with guest vocals including Jon Simmons of Balance and Composure, Tom Delonge of Blink 182 and Angels and Airwaves, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra and Jeremy Bolm of Touche Amore. The album was met with positive reception by fans and critics upon its release, and the group embarked on a successful headlining tour {{in support of the}} album in the summer of 2014.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Jay-Z worked {{extensively}} on the album's production with producers such as Swizz Beatz, Timbaland and Pharrell Williams who were also featured in the Samsung commercials promoting Magna Carta Holy Grail. He had also worked on the album's production with Jahlil Beats, Boi-1da, Mike Dean, Kanye West and Mike Will Made It, among others. He had also been seen in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> various recording artists such as Drake, The-Dream, Raekwon, Nas, and Timberlake working on the album. The final track listing revealed guest appearances by Timberlake, Frank Ocean, Nas, Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, Rick Ross and Beyoncé among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Morgan Lawley, was released through Black's YouTube channel on July 18, 2011, and a behind-the-scenes video was uploaded the day after. The video opens with Black in a studio, finishing the song recording with a studio band; guitarist Kellen McGee, bassist Jeremy Steel, and keyboardist Jourdan Steel. The video intercuts scenes of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> footage of Black making TV appearances, walking on red carpets, driving around Hollywood and greeting fans. Next, the singer is {{seen on a}} makeup chair and rehearsing several dance steps. She then starts the full choreography with So You Think You Can Dance finalists Robert Roldan and Kent Boyd. So You Think You Can Dances Allison Holker and Lauren Gottlieb also appear in the dance sections of the video. The video ends with Black at the premiere of My Moment, a fictional film about her.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Megadeth's fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman {{was chosen to}} produce the album, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace. Megadeth spent nearly four months in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful effort, Countdown to Extinction. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
