This was followed by La Parka finding Octagón bloodied and someone resembling Cibernético driving away on a motorcycle. The two teams were scheduled to face each other on October 1 at Héroes Inmortales IV with La Sociedad being represented by Electroshock, El Zorro, Hernandez and L.A. Park, while Legado AAA was scheduled to consist of Cibernético, Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón. Electroshock, the leader of Los Maniacos, had made no official announcement on whether he was joining La Sociedad or not, but agreed {{to take part in}} the match in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on Heavy Metal, with whom he had been feuding the past weeks. Prior to the match AAA, buying Konnan and Dorian's claim of Cibernético's turn, replaced him and the injured Octagón in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. In the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped Legado AAA pick up the win, but refused to celebrate with the victors, due to being upset with them believing he had turned on the company. Cibernético then went on to re–form his old stable Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo, vowing to show AAA how to really battle La Sociedad.|$|E

Echo DiSavoy (Kim Zimmer), seeking revenge on Clint for her mother's murder, seduces him in 1983 to ruin his marriage, then fakes her own death and frames him for it. Clint is later exonerated after Echo is found alive, and he and Viki reunite. Viki is shocked to discover in 1985 that her former ward Tina Clayton (Evans) is in fact her half-sister, daughter of Viki's father Victor and not Ted. Thanks to the machinations of Tina's boyfriend Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), Viki succumbs to the pressure and Niki Smith returns. Posing as Viki, Niki divorces Clint; Viki later overcomes her illness {{with the realization that}} it had actually been triggered by her witnessing Victor and Irene in bed many years before. Clint and Viki remarry in 1986, and Viki gives birth to their daughter Jessica Buchanan in September 1986. Jessica is kidnapped shortly after birth by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick), a disciple of Mitch Laurence; Jessica is soon returned unharmed in December, and Allison institutionalized. In 1988, Viki learns that she married and gave birth to a child in high school with high school sweetheart Roger Gordon (Larry Pine), but father Victor had her hypnotized to forget the occurrences. With Viki's memory restored in 1989, she annuls her 1960s off-screen marriage to Roger and initiates a relationship with daughter Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), an actress on the soap opera (within a soap opera), Fraternity Row. Megan and Viki initially spar, but ultimately get past their initial conflicts and become close.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, Silver King and Último Gladiador, {{two thirds}} of the stable Los Maniacos, {{announced}} they were joining La Sociedad, and although their stablemate Electroshock made no official announcement on whether or not he would be following them, he agreed to represent the group at Héroes Inmortales IV in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on longtime rival Heavy Metal, who would represent AAA in the steel cage match between the two groups. After the event, during which Heavy Metal suffered an injury, which would sideline him for four months, Electroshock officially announced that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan he once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result beaten down by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia, turning him técnico in the process. When Heavy Metal returned from his injury on February 4, 2011, he and Electroshock entered a Best of Five series, with the loser having his hair shaved off. During the series, King and Gladiador tried to recruit Heavy Metal as the newest member of Los Maniacos and even interfered in several of the matches, but Heavy Metal made clear {{that he did not want}} to join them. The fifth match, a best two-out-of-three falls Bull Terrier match, took place on March 18 at Rey de Reyes, where Heavy Metal was victorious after a guitar shot, forcing Electroshock to have his hair shaved off. After the match both Electroshock and Heavy Metal were attacked by members of La Sociedad, bringing the former rivals together to fight a common enemy. Just two days later, Los Maniacos surprisingly lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, after which Silver King and Último Gladiador were seemingly about to break up, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, with whom they would re–form Los Maniacos under the new name La Maniarquía. La Maniaquía was booked to settle their grudge with Electroshock and Heavy Metal at Triplemanía XIX in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, for which the técnicos recruited a veteran of hardcore wrestling, Joe Líder, whose partner, Nicho el Millonario, La Maniarquía had injured, as the third member of their team.|$|E

After Electroshock turned La Sociedad down for the second time on November 18, Silver King and Último Gladiador turned on him and beat him down with La Milicia. On November 27 Silver King officially kicked Electroshock out of Los Maniacos, while also announcing that his spot in the group would be taken by a new member. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes Silver King and Último Gladiador successfully defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a three–way ladder match against La Hermandad 187 and fellow La Sociedad members Hernandez and El Ilegal. On March 21, 2011, Los Maniacos lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans. In IWRG, Los Maniacos was joined by Joe Líder, with whom Silver King and Último Gladiador held the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship from March 3 to April 24 when they lost them during IWRG's Guerra de Empresas show. After losing the title to Los Psycho Circus, King and Gladiador turned on Líder and kicked him out of the group. Shortly thereafter, King and Gladiador joined forces with Chessman to form La Maniarquía. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, La Maniarquía was defeated by Electroshock, Heavy Metal and Joe Líder in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. In April 2012, Silver King made peace with Dr. Wagner, Jr. as the two came together to battle El Consejo stable. However, the alliance was short-lived as on August 5 during the main event of Triplemanía XX, Silver King turned on Wagner, Jr., who, despite the betrayal, managed to defeat Máscara Año 2000, Jr. in a Mask vs. Mask match. Afterwards, Silver King revealed that he had been behind El Consejo from the beginning, revealing himself {{as the leader of the}} rudo stable. However, Silver King quickly began having problems with his new stablemates, with Máscara Año 2000, Jr. asking how they could trust a man who was capable of betraying his own brother. The storyline was dropped after both Máscara Año 2000, Jr. and Toscano left El Consejo. On December 8, 2013, at Guerra de Titanes, Silver King, El Texano, Jr. and El Consejos newest member, El Hijo del Fantasma, unsuccessfully challenged Los Psycho Circus for the AAA World Trios Championship.|$|E

The slander that Demosthenes' wife also slept with the boy suggests that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage.* C. A. Cox, Household Interests, 202. Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men, such as Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, whom he allegedly deceived with the pretence that he could make him a great orator. Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad erastes to Aristarchus so as not even to deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his eromenos by pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on the boy's inheritance. Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.* A.W.

At the same time, Cena became involved in a storyline with non-wrestler Kevin Federline, when he began appearing on Raw with Johnny Nitro and Melina.

Smith hit one ball past Barnes, narrowly missing his head, but the Australian vowed to continue standing in close proximity. In the next over, Smith drove a full ball from Toshack directly into Barnes's foot, who managed to hide any pain despite the ball having enough momentum to ricochet {{all the way to the}} boundary.
