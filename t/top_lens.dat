50|$|The maximum NA {{is limited}} by the {{refractive}} index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a condenser lens with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under oil immersion (or, more rarely, under water immersion), with a layer of immersion oil placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An oil immersion condenser may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser mat not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the <b>top</b> <b>lens</b> and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically oil immersion condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the <b>top</b> <b>lens</b> and the slide.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{one of us}} {{published}} preliminary {{observations on}} {{the rate at which}} pigment leaves the human red cell when it is hemolyzed by moderate concentrations of saponin (Ponder, 1934 a). Shortly afterwards Fricke (1934) gave a theoretical treatment of the subject, and showed that for a completely permeable membrane the time for the hemoglobin to decrease to 10 per cent of its original concentration should be 0. 16 second {{in the case of the}} human erythrocyte. The longer times (several seconds) observed when moderate concentrations of saponin are used must accordingly correspond to a state of partial permeability, and in view of the results of the theoretical treatment it is desirable to have complete experimental data. With these this paper is concerned. Methods Human red ceils were used because of their large size, and the rate of escape of the pigment was found, as before, by taking moving pictures of the fading cells and making measurements on the films. In order to get a large number of cells per frame, the magnification was only 264 instead of 860, as in the preliminary measurements, and more attention was paid to obtaining good contrast than to having a high degree of resolution with its attendant disadvantage of small depth of focus. High resolution was, in fact, out of the question when the mixing of the cells and the lysin was done with micro pipettes. 1 1 Principally because, in order to obtain working room, the cover-glass on which the drops of suspension are placed has to be mounted a considerable distance above the condenser, which must either be a long focus condenser of correspondingly small aplanatic aperture, or an ordinary condenser with its <b>top</b> <b>lens,</b> and consequently most of its efficiency, removed.

40|$|The {{off-axis}} prismatic effects (prism) of five {{types of}} progressive power lenses were {{measured on a}} modified vertometer.

Conventional flat <b>top</b> bifocal <b>lenses</b> were also assessed. Progressive power lenses have smooth changes of prismatic effects, free of sharp "jumps" associated with bifocals. Differential prism of progressive lens pairs matched for power mainly result from a failure of some manufacturers to design for individual right and left lenses. This failure can produce up to 1. 0 Δ vertical and horizontal differential prism. We recommend that reduction of differential prismatic effects be carefully considered in future progressive lens design...|$|R

5000|$|Lanterns {{may also}} be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light sources outdoors. Low light level {{varieties}} are used for decoration. The term [...] "lantern" [...] is also used more generically to mean a light source, or the enclosure for a light source.

50|$|Current bifocals and {{progressive}} lenses are static, {{in that the}} user has to change their eye position {{to look through the}} portion of the lens with the focal power corresponding to the distance of the object.

50|$|San Venerio Lighthouse is a {{fortified}} neoclassical building, {{despite having}} undergone many changes over time. Construction of the lighthouse was granted by King Charles Albert of Savoy and was initially fueled by vegetable oil, followed later by coal. In 1884 another tower was built, {{taller than the}} original at 30 m high, and at the <b>top</b> of the <b>lenses</b> an optical filament was added, electrically powered by two steam engines. This system gave too much power to the beam of light, and in 1912 the fuel was replaced with petroleum. The lighthouse was later electrified, and became fully automated in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Frames {{can be made}} to {{hold the}} lenses in several {{different}} ways. There are three common styles: full frame, half frame, and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around the lenses. Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach to the <b>top</b> of the <b>lenses</b> and on the side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses. There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses, and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side.|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} of accessing information details while preserving context has generated many different focus-incontext techniques.

Finally, we show how lenses {{can be used on}} <b>top</b> of other <b>lenses,</b> effectively multiplying their magnification power in the same manner that a magnifying glass applied on top of another causes multiplicative magnification.

50|$|Any of {{the above}} features, color, polarization, gradation, mirroring, and materials, can be {{combined}} into the lens {{for a pair of}} sunglasses. Gradient glasses are darker at the <b>top</b> of the <b>lens</b> where the sky is viewed and transparent at the bottom. Corrective lenses or glasses can be manufactured with either tinting or darkened to serve as sunglasses. An alternative is to use the corrective glasses with a secondary lenses such as oversize sunglasses that fit over the regular glasses, clip-on lens that are placed in front of the glasses, and flip-up glasses which feature a dark lens that can be flipped up when not in use (see below). Photochromic lenses gradually darken when exposed to ultraviolet light.|$|R

40|$|A huge {{fraction}} of cameras used nowadays {{is based on}} CMOS sensors with a rolling shutter that exposes the image line by line. For dynamic scenes/cameras this introduces undesired effects like stretch, shear and wobble. It has been shown earlier that rotational shake induced rolling shutter effects in hand-held cell phone capture can be compensated based on {{an estimate of the}} camera rotation. In contrast, we analyse the case of significant camera motion, e. g. where a bypassing streetlevel capture vehicle uses a rolling shut-ter camera in a 3 D reconstruction framework. The intro-duced error is depth dependent and cannot be compensated based on camera motion/rotation alone, invalidating also rectification for stereo camera systems. On <b>top,</b> significant <b>lens</b> distortion as often present in wide angle cameras in-tertwines with rolling shutter effects as it changes the time at which a certain 3 D point is seen. We show that naive 3 D reconstructions (assuming global shutter) will deliver biased geometry already for very mild assumptions on ve-hicle speed and resolution. We then develop rolling shutter dense multiview stereo algorithms that solve for time of ex-posure and depth at the same time, even in the presence of lens distortion and perform an evaluation on ground truth laser scan models as well as on real street-level data. 1...|$|R
30|$|Forces {{involved}} {{in the formation of}} hydrocarbon reservoirs in hydrocarbon basins mainly include buoyancy, fluid pressure and dynamic force, expansive force of molecular volume, capillary force, molecule adsorption force, and intermolecular binding force (Pang et al. 2000). Under the action of buoyancy, natural gas migrates along migration pathways into traps in the upper part of a structure (White 1885). Under the action of the expansive force of gaseous molecules, natural gas migrates in a piston-type and accumulates in the lower part of a structure, with gas topped by water (Pang et al. 2003). Due to the capillary pressure difference between sandstone and mudstone, natural gas migrates into lens-type sandstones with larger pores, and accumulates at the <b>top</b> of the <b>lens</b> under the action of buoyancy to form a reservoir (Chen et al. 2004).|$|R

50|$|Progressive {{spectacle}} lenses, {{also called}} progressive addition lenses (PAL), progressive power lenses, graduated prescription lenses, and varifocal or multifocal lenses, are corrective lenses used in eyeglasses to correct presbyopia and other disorders of accommodation. They are characterised by a gradient of increasing lens power, {{added to the}} wearer's correction for the other refractive errors. The gradient starts at the wearer's distance prescription, at the <b>top</b> of the <b>lens</b> and reaches a maximum addition power, or the full reading addition, {{at the bottom of}} the lens. The length of the progressive power gradient on the lens surface depends on the design of the lens, with a final addition power between 0.75 and 3.50 dioptres. The addition value prescribed depends on the level of presbyopia of the patient. In general the older the patient, the higher the addition.|$|R
40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and {{occurrence of}} gold varies {{in a systematic}} manner in volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposits of eastern Australia. In deposits where it is concentrated with zinc {{at or near the}} top of the massive sulfide deposit, gold occurs in auriferous arsenopyrite and pyrite in the center of the lens, and electrum of variable fineness (300 - 900) in the baritic <b>top</b> of the <b>lens.</b> The former occurrence results from precipitation of the gold into the lattice of arsenopyrite and coprecipitation of submicroscopic gold grains in arsenic-poor pyrite. The latter occurrence results from direct precipitation of electrum from thio complexes owing to the decrease in aH•s caused by dilution and oxidation as hydrothermal fluids mix with seawater. In deposits where gold is concentrated with copper at the base of the sulfide lens and in the stringer zones, the gold occurs as electrum of high fineness (750 - 1, 000) or as gold tellurides that are commonly associated with chalcopyrite and/or pyrite.

40|$|High-precision {{machines}} typically {{suffer from}} small, but annoying, badly damped vibrations. In case such a vibration problem {{can not be}} solved passively, a solution may be found in active vibration control. In this respect, research at the Drebbel Institute is aimed at the development of a device called SMART DISC (SD). It is envisioned as an active structural element, consisting of a piezoelectric position actuator co-located with a piezoelectric force sensor, and control and amplifier electronics. As an industrial, three-dimensional test set-up for evaluation of the performance of SD's, the lens support of an ASML wafer stepper has been chosen. By inserting SD's in the lens support, and applying Integral Force Feedback control, the relative tilt of the lens relative to the main plate has been reduced by more than a factor 3.

40|$|SUMMARY: Cenozoic {{extension}} of areally varying ages and amounts has on average doubled {{the width of}} the Basin and Range Province. Extensional structures that formed at all depths down to 20 km, and which range in age from Oligocene to Holocene, are widely exposed and are here interpreted in terms of a model of depth-varying deformation. The middle crust is extended by discontinuous ductile shear as internally undeformed lenses slide apart along gently dipping zones of mylonite. The <b>tops</b> of these <b>lenses</b> are undulating detachment faults, the composite area of which increases with time as deep lenses slide out from underneath shallower ones. Brittle blocks of upper-crust bedrock above the detachments respond first by rotating between range-front faults, the same direction of rotation being maintained across a series of lenses, and then by pulling completely apart, while basinal strata fill the gaps and are dragged irectly on detachment faults. Some faults rise gently from the main detachment zones and surface as range-front faults. Most tilted-block ranges are isolated atop detachments. Detachment faults cut out crust. Beneath them are mid-crustal rocks of any age and type and above them are mostly upper-crustal rocks, including extensive syndeformational b si...|$|R
40|$|Spectacle mounted {{telescopic}} {{systems have}} been prescribed for visual impairment, providing magnified images of objects at farther distances. Typically, bioptic telescopes are mounted toward the <b>top</b> of spectacle <b>lenses</b> or above the frame with the telescope eyepiece positioned above the eye's pupil. This allows the wearer to alternate between the magnified narrow field of view available through the eyepiece and the unmagnified wide view through the carrier lens using head motion. The main obstacles to acceptance are the obvious appearance, limited field of the smaller Galilean telescopes, and weight of the larger Keplerian telescopes. We designed a spectacle-mounted wide-field Keplerian telescope built completely inside the spectacle lens. The design uses embedded mirrors inside the carrier lens for optical pathway folding and conventional lenses or curved mirrors. The small size of the ocular and its position with additional mirror tilt enable the user to view the magnified field simultaneously and above the unmagnified view of the uninterrupted horizontal field that is important for user's safety. This design enables the construction of cosmetic telescopes that can be produced as a commodity lens blank and surfaced to include the patient prescription. These devices may be also of utility in military and civilian use...|$|R
40|$|AbstractYoung animals {{compensate}} for defocus imposed by {{positive or negative}} spectacle lenses by adjusting the elongation rate of their vitreous chambers, thus matching {{the length of the}} eye with the focal length of the eye’s optics combined with the spectacle lenses. The ability to {{compensate for}} either negative or positive lenses could rely on the ability to distinguish between myopic and hyperopic blur, or it could rely on the fact that positive lenses would bring nearby objects into focus, thereby reducing the amount of blur, whereas negative lenses would not. This study asks whether eyes emmetropize using the magnitude of blur or the sign of blur as a directional cue. We fitted chick eyes with positive lenses while imposing a substantial amount of blur, either (a) by having them wear lenses only when restrained {{in the center of a}} cylinder, the walls of which were beyond their far-point or (b) by having them wear mild diffusers over positive lenses. We found good refractive compensation in both situations in a large number of birds. Furthermore, we found that mild diffusers worn on <b>top</b> of positive <b>lenses</b> differentially affected the two ocular components of refractive compensation: there was less choroidal thickening, but more inhibition of ocular elongation, compared to wearing positive lenses alone. These findings argue both that the eye can discern the sign of the blur and that choroidal and ocular-elongation components of the refractive compensation do not respond identically to visual inputs...|$|R
