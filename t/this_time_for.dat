5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a smaller {{and less expensive}} building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
