5|$|Camino, a 2008 Spanish film {{directed}} by Javier Fesser, allegedly {{based on the}} real story of Alexia González-Barros, a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and awaits canonization. Fesser portrays the Opus Dei in a negative way, depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families, suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Camino's painful death for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind {{the myth of the}} house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies the problem of the devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commons.|$|E

25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons {{as an example of}} what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.|$|E

25|$|Articulating {{solutions}} to <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons {{is one of}} the main problems of political philosophy. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{evolutionary}} suicide, where adaptation {{at the level}} of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons.

25|$|Examples of {{overfishing}} {{exist in}} areas such as the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea. In these locations, overfishing has not only proved disastrous to fish stocks but also to the fishing communities relying on the harvest.

25|$|Using {{the idea}} of shadows, a major theme that {{received}} considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war.
