5|$|England {{were largely}} the better team and, {{if not for}} the {{resilient}} batting of Chanderpaul, they would have won by an even larger margin. The West Indies suffered greatly from his absence in the second Test, losing the match by an innings and 283 runs, their biggest defeat in Test history. England retained the Wisden trophy at Old Trafford by taking an unbeatable 2–0 lead, <b>They</b> <b>ultimately</b> won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn was a highly-regarded prospect, ranked fifth among draft-eligible North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Some scouts saw him as a mix between Calder Trophy and Norris Trophy nominee Dion Phaneuf and two-time Stanley Cup {{champion}} Adam Foote. E. J. McGuire, then-director of the Central Scouting Bureau, compared him {{to former}} first overall selection Ed Jovanovski. At the Draft, the Toronto Maple Leafs traded with the New York Islanders for a higher draft pick, which <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> used to select Schenn.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{recorded}} tropical storm-force winds, {{both of which}} were away from the center. Some higher surf was recorded along the New Jersey coastline. In September 2001, two men sought to break the record for sailing the quickest time from New York City to Melbourne, Australia; Humberto disrupted their early path slightly, but <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> broke the record by 28 hours. Later in its path, there were several marine warnings issued for offshore Newfoundland, although no severe weather affected coastal Atlantic Canada. Overall, there were no reports of casualties or damage from the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} its war with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedonia, located in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Sons of Soul is the 1993 third studio album by American R group Tony! Toni! Toné! The band {{originally}} {{recorded for}} the album at several studios in California, including Westlake Recording Studios and Paradise Recording Studio.

Toné! moved their sessions to Caribbean Sound Basin in Trinidad, where <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> wrote and recorded most of the album.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers have a {{somewhat}} checkered history with Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG). They have, numerous times, been announced for events at which <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> did not perform, {{such as when}} they were scheduled for a PWG World Tag Team Championship match against Roderick Strong and PAC at Giant-Size Annual #4, but wound up being replaced by then-PWG World Champion El Generico and Kevin Steen.|$|E

The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did not seriously contend for the division title. <b>They</b> <b>ultimately</b> lost their ALDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E

Mark is furious and tries to win Lexie back, but shortly after Callie is involved in a car accident and Lexie consoles Mark. The next episode, Lexie explains that she will go back to Mark if he continues to pursue her, but she believes <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> aren't suited and will be unhappy. Mark agrees to let her go, giving her and Jackson his blessing.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{with the}} new type in hand, the Deseret News began {{printing}} with it. It would print one piece per issue in the new alphabet, usually a quotation from The Book of Mormon or the New Testament. However, this only lasted for one year, after which the practice stopped; it would start again in May 1864 and stop permanently {{at the end of}} that year.Benn Pitman, the brother of Isaac Pitman, was also interested in spelling reform, and by 1864 had published his own orthography, which the board of regents considered adopting. However, <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} months in New Guinea, Whitehead {{concentrated}} on {{building up the}} infrastructure there. He obtained additional engineer units and construction equipment. New airfields were developed, along with roads, housing, taxiways and revetments to protect his aircraft from the frequent Japanese air raids. He also attempted {{to build up the}} morale and leadership of his units. These months coincided with the Kokoda Track campaign. For a time, despite the efforts of his airmen and the ground troops, the Japanese advanced steadily on Port Moresby, but <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> turned back short of it. For his part in the Papuan campaign, Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Australian government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Canada, Roberts {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth $8 million. He chose his hometown Maple Leafs because he felt they had a better opportunity to win the Stanley Cup than Carolina did. He recorded 53 points in 2000–01 and his 29 goals led the team. A 48-point season followed in 2001–02 and he assumed leadership of the Maple Leafs during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs after team captain Mats Sundin suffered a season-ending injury. Roberts led Toronto past their first round opponent, the New York Islanders, in an occasionally violent seven game series. The Maple Leafs reached the Eastern Conference final, where <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> lost to Carolina. Roberts led Toronto in playoff scoring with 19 points in 19 games.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Bret was {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake. The third tropical cyclone of 1993 Atlantic hurricane season, Bret formed on August4 from a westward-moving, African tropical wave. Bret would later peak as a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm as it neared Trinidad. It took an extremely southerly course through the Caribbean, passing over {{the coasts of}} Venezuela and Colombia. High terrain in the northern parts of those countries severely disrupted the circulation of the storm, and Bret had weakened to a tropical depression before emerging over the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea. There, it restrengthened to a tropical storm and made landfall in Nicaragua on August 10, dissipating soon after. Bret's remnants reached the Pacific Ocean, where <b>they</b> <b>ultimately</b> became Hurricane Greg.|$|E
