5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} {{systems can}} trigger earthquakes {{as part of}} hydraulic fracturing. The project in Basel, Switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection.|$|E
5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Variations in the {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} pudendal nerve (PN) have been described in the literature. This study investigated these variations in order to comment on a safe area for the placement of a Richter's stitch. METHODS : Richter's procedure was performed on nine unembalmed female cadavers and followed by dissection. PN dissections were done on another 20 embalmed female cadavers. Variations in the {{branching pattern}} of the PN were noted and the distance between <b>the</b> <b>Richter's</b> stitch placed and the PN/or the inferior rectal nerve (IRN) measured. RESULTS : The IRN entered the gluteal region as a separate structure in 6 / 29 cases. The separate IRN was found to pass between 4. 1 and 14. 45 mm medial to the ischial spine in 18 / 29 cases. In one case, <b>the</b> <b>Richter's</b> stitch was found to pierce the IRN. The distance between the stitch and the PN and/or the IRN ranged from 0 to 17. 8 mm. CONCLUSIONS : To {{minimize the risk of}} nerve damage or entrapment, <b>the</b> <b>Richter's</b> stitch should be placed > 20 mm from the ischial spine. This recommended area should be revised for different population groups, as variations might exist between groups. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a fire fighting effort began.

5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E

5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|Striking the Autonomous Region of Azores on 1 January, the 1980 Azores Island {{earthquake}} killed 61 {{people and}} injured over 400, causing severe {{damage on the}} islands of Terceira and São Jorge. Measuring 7.2 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale, it also shook the islands of Pico and Faial, and resulted from a strike slip fracture, typical of other historical Azorean earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The 1916 Irondale {{earthquake}} struck north–central Alabama on October 18. The greatest {{earthquake in}} state history, it registered an estimated magnitude of 5.1 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude scale {{and resulted in}} extensive minor damage. Damage, limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties, reached its maximum severity near the epicenter {{in the city of}} Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, sending alarmed workers from tall buildings.|$|E

5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} that struck the Azorean islands was a magnitude 7.2 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale. It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% {{of the houses}} on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Heroísmo. In general, public buildings such as churches remained intact, while several buildings caved in on themselves. Public utilities such as electricity and water, were reported cut in several areas.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring the utility of <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} explosivity index (commonly shortened to VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, {{for measuring}} the strength of eruptions. It {{is used by the}} Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in assessing the impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows. It operates in a way similar to <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale for earthquakes, in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude (it is logarithmic). The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are of VEIs between 0 and 2.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
