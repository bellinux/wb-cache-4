A sample of 108 women, aged between 35 and 55 years, completed questionnaire measures of body dissatisfaction, appearance investment, aging anxiety, media exposure (television and magazine), and attitudes toward cosmetic surgery (delineated in terms of general attitudes, social motivations, <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> <b>consideration).</b> Body dissatisfaction, appearance investment, aging anxiety, and both media variables predicted some facet of attitudes toward cosmetic surgery.

These rites, though empty and unmeaning ceremonies {{to those who have}} no religious faith in them, are full of the most profound impressiveness and solemnity for those who have. The priest, having laid aside his Protestant disguise, administered the sacrament of the mass, which was, according to the Catholic views, a <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> re-enacting of the sacrifice of Christ, to inure to the special benefit of the individual soul for which it was offered. The priest then received the penitent's confession of sin, expressed in a faint and feeble assent to the words of contrition which the Church prescribes, and this was followed by a pardon--a <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> pardon, as the sinner supposed, granted and declared by a commissioner fully empowered by authority from heaven both to grant and declare it.

The extreme unction is the last rite. This being performed, the dying Catholic feels that all is well.

The present research provides the answer to this question.

The composition of the General Assembly was changed. Representation in the house of delegates was apportioned {{on the basis of the}} census of 1850, counting Whites only. The Senate representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats, with the west receiving twenty, and the east thirty senators. This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation on the basis of White population in 1865, or else put the matter to a public referendum. But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> value, except for slaves. Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their true value.

Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west, the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new Constitution.

Independent components (ICs) of properly parameterized ECG signals are more readily interpretable than the measurements themselves, or their ICs.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Initially a central topic for psychology, suggestibility has been forgotten, rediscovered, evaded definition, sabotaged experimentation and persistently triggers epistemological short-circuits when interconnecting psychological questions of memory, childhood and scientificity, with concrete legal issues of child witnesses' credibility, the disclosure of sexual abuse and psychological expertise in courts of law. The {{aim of this study}} is to trace suggestibility through history, theory, research and practice, and to explore its efficacy at the intersection of psychology and law, by examining and comparing the. concrete case of child witness practice in England and Germany. Taking a transdisciplinary approach the study draws on two interrelated sources of 'data' combining historical, theoretical and research literature with the analysis of empirical data. A genealogy if theory and research is combined with the results of reflexive interviews, conducted in England and Germany with practitioners from all those professions involved in creating, applying or dealing with knowledge about child witnesses and suggestibility: judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers, psychologists (researchers, experts) and social workers. Drawing on the work of G. Deleuze and 1. Stengers this study shows how practical tensions around reliable witnesses, evidence and expertise merge pragmatically with theoretical movements employed to adjust the discipline, thereby causing frictions and voids. In this sense suggestibility provides a liminal resource: It transgresses disciplinary boundaries and pervades pragmatic and theoretical, global and personal, historical <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> <b>considerations,</b> creating voids that allow us to reconsider the pragmatics of change and to redefine the issue of critical impact, as well as to reformulate the problem of child witness practice and children's suggestibility. The study hopes to make a concrete contribution to facilitating the just prosecution of sexual abuse by adding transparency to the complex and at times unhelpfully polarised field of child witness practice. By exploring the 'pragmatics of change' the study furthermore hopes to give an unsettling and productive impetus to theoretical debates within critical approaches to psychology...|$|R
40|$|The present {{situation}} of control engineering {{in the context}} of automated production can be described as a tension field between its desired outcome <b>and</b> its <b>actual</b> <b>consideration.</b> On the one hand, the share of control engineering compared to the other engineering domains has significantly increased within the last decades due to rising automation degrees of production processes and equipment. On the other hand, the control engineering domain is still underrepresented within the production engineering process. Another limiting factor constitutes a lack of methods and tools to decrease the amount of software engineering efforts and to permit the development of innovative automation applications that ideally support the business requirements. This thesis addresses this challenging situation by means of {{the development of a new}} control engineering methodology. The foundation is built by concepts from computer science to promote structuring and abstraction mechanisms for the software development. In this context, the key sources for this thesis are the paradigm of Service-oriented Architecture and concepts from Model-driven Engineering. To mold these concepts into an integrated engineering procedure, ideas from Systems Engineering are applied. The overall objective is to develop an engineering methodology to improve the efficiency of control engineering by a higher adaptability of control software and decreased programming efforts by reuse...|$|R
40|$|Summary Aim: The multisectoral {{approach}} is often adopted in national policies of fight against AIDS. This article analyzes {{the characteristics of}} the actors’ network and their influence on the governance of the HIV program in Haiti. Methods: The qualitative data comes from interviews, observations and documentation. For their analysis, two techniques are used: namely thematic and structural analysis. The interpretation of results is based on the theory of the strategic actor (Crozier M, et al. L’acteur et le système : les contraintes de l’action collective. Paris : Ed. du Seuil; 1977 [1]) and the theory of network governance. These concepts allow to study and have an insight on the participants’ potential power, their strategies and interactions within the network. Results: These actors, with their diversity, the resources they control, and the nature of their interactions, determine the challenges regarding governance. There is a gap between the leadership role attributed to the national coordinating body <b>and</b> the <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> nature of its influence within the network. This discrepancy is mainly attributable to the fact that its potential power, defined by available resources, places it in a weak position, which as a result translates into its incapacity to effectively impact the situations at hand. The study reveals the links between the actors’ characteristics and their ability to influence the process of governance through the web of relationships and the structure of power game. Conclusion: In Haiti, many actors are involved in the fight against HIV. The analysis of the complex network they operate within has shown that their potential to influence the program were uneven. This constitutes an important challenge for the national coordinating body. Prat Organ Soins. 2012; 43 (2) : 131 - 14...|$|R

40|$|Information {{exchange}} {{is becoming more}} and more important as modern manufacturers increasingly rely on integrated product development. Research shows that designers may not be aware of existing information or be willing to disrupt their work to search for the relevant information. One part of the answer to issues related to understanding, availability <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> <b>consideration</b> is context. The research trend in knowledge sharing seems to be moving towards integration of additional platform-independent applications and lightweight product representations to accommodate contextual communication, even though findings suggest user reservation to additional applications. The part Computer Aided Design and Engineering systems play in the product lifecycle however continues to expand, as is the concept of Simulation-Driven Design as a means of ensuring downstream product lifecycle consideration. The underlying purpose of the research presented in this thesis is essentially to, enable and ensure awareness, access and understanding of product and process related information, for relevant actors, during relevant activities and within relevant environments. The proposed approach serves to enable, and to an extent ensure, contextual decision support within the early stages of product development, thus increasing the foundation for continued understanding and overall development. The approach has been implemented, and the resulting demonstrator includes but a few examples of how heavyweight technologies can, and to an extent should be used to ensure a better foundation for design decisions. The presented approach is a general way of not only enabling Simulation-Driven Design capabilities, but ensuring that they in fact have the desired impact. Investigations and demonstrator evaluations show that access to supporting tools and relevant information has to be made readily and contextually available. These have to be intuitive, integrated into the environment where they are needed, and ultimately be perceived as a natural part of daily development in order for them to be accepted and used. It is important to realise that the tools themselves are no cure-alls, nor are they replacements for purposeful communication and conscious consideration to all aspects of the product lifecycle. Still, transparency and an educational approach to tool development could be a catalyst, an entry point towards ensuring insight and understanding, so that each actor in turn can act with consideration to the product lifecycle as a whole, instead of just the task at hand.

At one such occasion, the author had to gather custom made test equipment, to investigate certain effects in silicon sensors manufactured by ST Microelectronics.

Nevertheless, the investigations proofed to be useful and ST Microelectronics was able to remedy the problems. A manufacturing, assembly and quality assurance process can only be declared successful, when the final product in the end is working within the specifications. To prove that this is true for the CMS tracker detector modules, the author joined a collaboration of young physicists to examine the performance of a selection of modules in a testbeam at the DESY research facility in Hamb urg, Germany.

The specific objectives were to present (1) an apparatus and a procedure allowing recording of the load regime, and (2) an example of the raw data and six performance indicators of the usage of the prosthesis obtained with this method. A subject was monitored for a period of five hours as he went about his daily activities. The load regime was directly measured and recorded using a commercial transducer and data logger. The overall load profile presented alternative periods of variable length of inactivity (64 %) and activity (36 %), respectively. The maximum load applied on the medio-lateral, antero-posterior and the long axes represented 21 %, 21 % and 120 % of the body weight, respectively. The antero-posterior, medio-lateral and long components of the impulse were 395 kN. s, 359 kN. s and 2, 323 kN. s, respectively.

As in [27], the <b>true</b> positives <b>and</b> the false positives are computed {{by comparing the}} detection results with incrementally dilated ground truth, while the false negatives are computed comparing the ground truth with an incrementally dilated version of the detection results. Then, varying the dilation radius allows us to distinguish between errors due to a slight mislocation of the crack <b>and</b> <b>actual</b> nondetections.|$|R
