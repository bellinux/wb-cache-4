5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A.

This broke with the long-standing botanical <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E

The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.|$|E
5|$|The date of Krishna's {{birth is}} celebrated every year as Janmashtami. According to mythologies in the Jain tradition, Krishna was {{a cousin of}} Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara of the Jains.

Based on interpreting the events and circumstances described in the Puranas, several Indian sources place Krishna as an actual historic person and to a much later period, about 3100BCE.|$|E

5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5|$|After Ultimecia is defeated, {{the time}} and space that she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline, while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Since {{she does not want}} to involve the children, she absorbs the dying Ultimecia's powers as part of the cycle of sorceresses (a sorceress must pass her powers to a {{successor}} before she can die peacefully). Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox: Squall must become leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid (who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including Squall).|$|E

5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino.

In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E

5|$|In Hindu traditions, Krishna is {{considered}} the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Krishna marries the Ashtabharyas or the eight principle queens (Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti, Bhadra, and Lakshmana). He also marries about 16,000–16,100 women known as his junior queens, he accepted them as his wives upon their insistence to save their dignity and honor because society who saw them as slaves of the demon king Narakasura. The chief wife among these junior wives is Rohini. His lover, who he is most commonly seen with in images and idols is Radha. All of his wives and his lover Radha are considered in the Hindu <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> be the avatars of the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Gopis are considered as Radha's many forms and manifestations.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism. Jains believe that there were 23 {{teachers}} before the Mahavira, and they believe that Jainism was founded in far more ancient times {{than that of the}} Mahavira, whom they revere as the 24th Tirthankara. The first 22 Tirthankaras are placed in mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> have been born 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is contradicted by all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
5|$|Classic Maya social {{organization}} {{was based on}} the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by <b>tradition</b> <b>to</b> such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.|$|E
