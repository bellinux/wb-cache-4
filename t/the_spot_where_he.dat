5|$|Approximately 5,000 {{people came}} to Simpson's funeral service. A {{memorial}} stands close to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> died {{and has become a}} pilgrimage for many cyclists.

5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Schreck {{developed}} meningitis {{and died}} on 16 May in Munich. He was a well-liked man and Hitler was distraught when Schreck died. His final rank was SS-Oberführer, a rank between colonel and general. Schreck was accorded a Nazi state funeral with Hitler delivering his eulogy. Schreck's funeral {{was attended by}} many senior Nazi officials, including Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Konstantin von Neurath, Emil Maurice, Hans Baur, Heinrich Hoffmann and Baldur von Schirach. As with many other buried Nazi Party members, Schreck's grave marker was removed after World War II {{and there is a}} stone without inscription on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was buried.|$|E

5|$|President's Park, {{better known}} as Lafayette Square, may have its own {{spectral}} resident. Philip Barton Key II {{was the son of}} Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the other man pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was shot.|$|E
5|$|Christianity has a {{long history}} in present-day Turkey, which is the birthplace of {{numerous}} Christian Apostles and Saints, such as Paul of Tarsus, Timothy, Nicholas of Myra, Polycarp of Smyrna and many others. Saint Peter founded one of the first churches in Antioch (Antakya), the location of which is regarded by tradition as <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> first preached the Gospel, and where the followers of Jesus were called Christians {{for the first time in}} history. The house where Virgin Mary lived the final days of her life until her Assumption (according to Catholic doctrine) or Dormition (according to Orthodox belief), and the tomb of John the Apostle who accompanied her during the voyage to Anatolia after the crucifixion of Jesus, are in Ephesus. The cave churches in Cappadocia were among the hiding places of early Christians during the Roman persecutions against them. The Eastern Orthodox Church has been headquartered in Constantinople (Istanbul) since the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Two of the five major episcopal sees of the Pentarchy (Constantinople and Antioch) instituted by Justinian the Great in 531 AD were located in present-day Turkey during the Byzantine period.|$|E

25|$|Major General Richard Taylor, {{in command}} of the Confederate forces in Louisiana, had retreated up the Red River in order to connect with {{reinforcements}} from Texas and Arkansas. Taylor selected a clearing a few miles south of Mansfield as <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would take a stand against the Union forces. Sending his cavalry to harass the Union vanguard as it approached, Taylor called his infantry divisions forward.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{community}} that developed {{into what is}} now known as the Russian Orthodox Church is traditionally said to have been founded by the Apostle Andrew, who is thought to have visited Scythia and Greek colonies along the northern coast of the Black Sea. According to one of the legends, Andrew reached the future location of Kiev and foretold the foundation of a great Christian city. <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> reportedly erected a cross is now marked by St. Andrew's Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades later {{announced}} that they had captured a third Israeli, Noach Moskovich from the central Israeli city of Rishon LeZion. However Moskovich was eventually discovered dead, apparently of natural causes, near <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had last been seen. The Brigades also threatened that, should there be any Palestinian civilian casualties {{as a result of}} the incursion, they would attack Israel's overseas embassies. As night fell, the Israel Defense Forces began shelling locations in Gaza with artillery, and hit two weapons warehouses.|$|E
25|$|Scottish Protestants were {{increasingly}} viewed as dangerous turncoats who {{sided with the}} English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher George Wishart (1513-1546) in the castle’s Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake {{in front of the}} castle walls on March 1. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> died. In May of that same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the cardinal. On May 26 they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as masons when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the garrison, they murdered Cardinal Beaton and hung his body from his window {{on the front of the}} castle.|$|E
25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would have buried her and reciting what he would have said to their neighbours.|$|E
50|$|The men had {{conspired to}} slay the priest, {{due to his}} tireless missionary activities. When they {{reached the top of}} the Hill, the men tried to kill him. The serene Vaz knelt down on the rock and held his stick {{straight}} on the ground. A light flashed in their midst and the men could see water gushing from <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> knelt. Owing to this miracle, the men fled from the scene and Vaz returned to the parish unharmed. A shrine dedicated to him was constructed at that very site at Mudipu. It is visited annually by thousands of pilgrims and devotees, seeking blessings and cures for various ailments.|$|R

25|$|In 1859 Tayloe House was {{the scene}} of a murder. Philip Barton Key II was the son of Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The {{following}} day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a single pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the other man pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was shot.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} Bahá'í holy places {{in and around}} Acre. They {{originate}} from Bahá'u'lláh's imprisonment in the Citadel during Ottoman Rule. The final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life were spent in the Mansion of Bahjí, just outside Acre, {{even though he was}} still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892 in Bahjí, and the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh is the most holy place for Bahá'ís— their Qiblih, the location they face when saying their daily prayers. It contains the remains of Bahá'u'lláh and is near <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> died in the Mansion of Bahjí. Other Bahá'í sites in Acre are the House of `Abbúd (where Bahá'u'lláh and his family resided) and the House of `Abdu'lláh Páshá (where later 'Abdu'l-Bahá resided with his family), and the Garden of Ridván where he spent the end of his life. In 2008, the Bahai holy places in Acre and Haifa were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm, {{thinking}} {{over the}} manifold blessings continually bestowed upon him by God, pondered anxiously {{in his mind}} what he should give Him in return. At length, the grace of the Holy Ghost working within him, he set his heart upon increasing the worship of God so he established a new episcopal see at Marthillach (Mortlach), not far from <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had overcome the Norwegians, and gained the victory; and endowed it with churches, and the rents of many estates.|$|E
50|$|Sarala Dasa {{spent his}} last time at Bila Sarala but the native place Kanakavati Patana known as Kanakapura at Tentuliapada with a {{religious}} establishment known as Munigoswain, which marks as <b>the</b> traditional <b>spot,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> composed his works. This period of his lifetime {{was known as}} the medieval period.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} {{the line of}} the Vouga {{to the point where it}} emerged from the hills, crossed these, and came down upon the Douro some ten miles above San Joao, at nearly <b>the</b> same <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had before made the passage when on his way to join Romana.|$|R

500|$|Heth's {{division}} advanced {{with two}} brigades forward, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis. They proceeded easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. [...] west of town, about 7:30a.m. on July 1, the two brigades met light resistance from vedettes of Union cavalry, and deployed into line. According to lore, the Union soldier {{to fire the}} first shot of the battle was Lt. Marcellus Jones. In 1886 Lt. Jones returned to Gettysburg to mark <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> fired the first shot with a monument. Eventually, Heth's men reached dismounted troopers of Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade, who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading carbines. Still, by 10:20a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when {{the vanguard of the}} I Corps (Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds) finally arrived.|$|E
500|$|Oswald {{soon came}} to be {{regarded}} as a saint. Bede says that <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> died {{came to be}} associated with miracles, and people took dirt from the site, which led to a hole being dug as deep as a man's height. Reginald of Durham recounts another miracle, saying that his right arm was taken by a bird (perhaps a raven) to an ash tree, which gave the tree ageless vigor; when the bird dropped the arm onto the ground, a spring emerged from the ground. Both the tree and the spring were, according to Reginald, subsequently associated with healing miracles. Aspects of the legend have been considered to have pagan overtones or influencesthis may represent a fusion of his status as a traditional Germanic warrior-king with Christianity. The name of the site, Oswestry, or [...] "Oswald's Tree", is generally thought to be derived from Oswald's death there and the legends surrounding it. [...] His feast day is 5 August. The cult surrounding him even gained prominence in parts of continental Europe.|$|E
500|$|A granite {{memorial}} to Simpson stands on <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> collapsed and died on Ventoux, one kilometre {{east of the}} summit, with the words [...] "Olympic medallist, world champion, British sporting ambassador." [...] Cycling opened a subscription fund in the week following his death, raising around £1,500. It was unveiled in 1968 by Simpson's wife Helen, Hoban and the British team manager Alec Taylor. It {{was inspired by the}} {{memorial to}} motorcycle racer Jimmie Guthrie, who crashed and died at Guthrie's Memorial, Isle of Man, in 1937. Over the years, Simpson's memorial slowly fell into disrepair and a new plinth was constructed, secured into the mountainside with steel rods. On the 30th anniversary of Simpson's death, his daughters Joanne and Jane added a plaque that reads, [...] "There is no mountain too high." [...] Concrete steps from the roadside to the memorial were opened on the 40th anniversary. The memorial has become a pilgrimage to cyclists, who pass the memorial and frequently leave tributes such as drinking bottles and caps. In nearby Bédoin, there is a plaque in the square, placed by journalists following the 1967 Tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{not come}} back? Oh, {{where do you}} go?"
