25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|The LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, after {{conducting}} {{an investigation into}} Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate: I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica {{two or three weeks}} before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E
500|$|Emmy Noether {{was born}} on 23 March 1882, {{the first of four}} children. Her first name was [...] "Amalie", after her mother and {{paternal}} grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age. As a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.|$|E

[...] Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, {{one of my best friends}} growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture.|$|E
