5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|Kim races after Edward, while Jim obtains {{a handgun}} and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes Edward and fights with him; Edward refuses {{to fight back}} until he sees Jim slap Kim as she {{attempts}} to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before departing. As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Jim and Edward killed each other.|$|E
5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless {{played a crucial}} role in the siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha wanted to take over the poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried to take over the city in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the city had ammunition to spare.|$|E

5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ryan {{goes to the}} {{basement}} to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother {{and those of other}} patients with bogyphobia (phobia of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Laura is hallucinating. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.|$|E
5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E

5|$|The {{attempts}} to gain {{entry to the}} manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal, the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums to break in. Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarizing. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the Book, finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.|$|E
5|$|To further {{interest}} the case, House manipulates the team, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer), by swapping {{his own blood}} sample, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he too has syphilis, perhaps the cause for his misanthropic personality and unfriendliness. He then pretends to get a nicer personality, but gets less able as a doctor as he pretends to take the penicillin they prescribe him, and everyone falls for House's trick (which he has confided to Wilson). Meanwhile, Foreman believes he isn't getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde), {{when he tries to}} do their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies that if he did not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able enough to handle the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Jacobites' {{position}} was now defensive, holding a large enclave in western Ireland, including {{all of the}} province of Connacht, bounded by the River Shannon. The Jacobites' successful defence of Limerick encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they could win the war with help from France (though many of the French troops sent with James were withdrawn after his flight). William left Ireland in late 1690, entrusting command of the Williamite forces to the Dutch general Godert de Ginkell.|$|E
25|$|Paneth and Peters in the 1920s {{already knew}} that {{palladium}} can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen gas, storing it at several thousands of times the atmospheric pressure. This led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they could increase the nuclear fusion rate by simply loading palladium rods with hydrogen gas. Tandberg then tried the same experiment but used electrolysis to make palladium absorb more deuterium and force the deuterium further together inside the rods, thus anticipating the main elements of Fleischmann and Pons' experiment. They all hoped that pairs of hydrogen nuclei would fuse together to form helium, {{which at the time}} was needed in Germany to fill zeppelins, but no evidence of helium or of increased fusion rate was ever found.|$|E
25|$|This {{was also}} the belief of {{geologist}} Palmer, who convinced Steven Jones that the helium-3 occurring naturally in Earth perhaps came from fusion involving hydrogen isotopes inside catalysts like nickel and palladium. This led their team in 1986 to independently make the same experimental setup as Fleischmann and Pons (a palladium cathode submerged in heavy water, absorbing deuterium via electrolysis). Fleischmann and Pons had much the same belief, but they calculated the pressure to be of 1027 atmospheres, when cold fusion experiments only achieve a loading ratio of one to one, which only has between 10,000 and 20,000 atmospheres. John R. Huizenga says they had misinterpreted the Nernst equation, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that there was enough pressure to bring deuterons so {{close to each other}} that there would be spontaneous fusions.|$|E

25|$|In Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances, the Silver Surfer confronts Cyborg Superman {{over the}} {{destruction}} of a planet and is met by Parallax. Parallax beats the Cyborg, but the Silver Surfer lets him go and tries to sympathize with Parallax. The two return to Earth to find Kyle Rayner with Thanos, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they formed an alliance when in reality Thanos tricked Kyle. Kyle convinces the Surfer to help him stop Parallax and Thanos from destroying the universe and that he was duped into giving Thanos Oa's power. The Surfer similarly gave most of his power to Parallax to reform the destroyed planet, forcing Kyle to use his ring to drain both villains of their enhanced powers before they can destroy everything. Unable to contain the power himself, Kyle channels the power from the two villains into the Silver Surfer, who opens a portal and sucks the two inside.|$|E
25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and on the chair that she had been sitting in. This led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} royalty during that time, who were {{cautious}} at first of showing {{support to the}} new ideological movement, Friedrich Christian, like his brother Prince Stephan, was an early supporter of the Nazi party, officially joining the rising political group in 1929; another source however has the prince actually working with the Nazis as early as August 1928 after a relative, Hereditary Prince Ernst of Lippe, had joined three months earlier. The House of Schaumburg-Lippe would eventually come to have ten members in the Nazi party. Hitler wanted these high-ranking members of society for propaganda reasons - the more who joined, the more socially acceptable his new regime would be. Like Friedrich and his brother Prince Wolrad, Hitler appointed many of these new members to the Sturmabteilung as stormtroopers, as he wanted the organization to bring together individuals from all levels of society. In its early years, Hitler was more concerned with votes and finances than consistent ideology, and consequently {{did his best to}} ease and hasten the process for new members. As a result, Hitler made various assurances to its new and prospective members, stating the movement had room for republicans and monarchists alike and leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he intended to restore the monarchy.|$|E
