Caterpillars of the Brazilian skipper butterfly (Calpodes ethlius), {{also known as the}} larger canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> cut the leaves and roll them over to live inside while pupating and eating the leaf. [...] In addition, caterpillars of the lesser canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Geshna cannalis), a grass moth, will sew the leaves shut before they can unfurl by spinning a silk thread around the leaf.

40|$|Abstract: The tea {{industry}} of Bangladesh {{is one of}} the most important foreign exchange earner and source of income. Sylhet, the northeastern divisional city of Bangladesh, is the major tea-producing region of the country. For this reason the study area was selected in Sylhet district to assess the pattern and causes of fluctuation on <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> production in selected tea Estates and the impact of micro-climate change on the productivity of <b>tea</b> <b>leaf.</b> The yield of tea is greatly influenced by microclimatic parameter of a region especially rainfall, temperature. Scanty rainfall causes irreparable losses because irrigation is seldom used on tea plantations. On the other hand, heavy rains erode top soil and wash away fertilizers and other chemicals. An analysis of the results of field experiments with weather data shows that increase highest <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> production per hectare lies on 4000 mm to 4600 mm rainfall. Heavy or scanty or delayed rainfall adversely affected the growth and yield of tea. It is observed that <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> production is slightly increased with increase in total annual rainfall. The temperature and humidity have no direct effect on <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> production. It may largely depend on soil quality and solar radiation. Loobacherra tea estate produces high amount (1838. 70 kg) of <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> per unit area, on the other hand, Lackatoorah tea estate produce lowest amount (682. 31 kg) of <b>tea</b> <b>leaf.</b> Further study is needed to identify the cause of variation of <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> production in different tea estate. Awareness should be rise on micro-climate change amongst the planter, estates and worker groups for the maximum production of <b>tea</b> <b>leaf...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> significantly improved the survival of mealybugs in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R

NaOCl {{have been}} proven effective againts Enterococcus faecalis for root canal irrigation process. Green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract (Camellia sinensis) can be chosen as an alternative solution for root canal irrigation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the difference of green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract (Camellia sinensis) and NaOCl 2. 5 % efficacy againts the growth of Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. This is a laboratory experimental study with “post test only group” design. The first step of the trial was done by making green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract and then determine the lowest concentration on which the first solution become clear. The concentration that were tested are 1. 5 %, 2. 5 %, 3. 5 %, 4. 5 % and 5. 5 %. Based on the trial, it was found that the minimal inhibiton concentration of the green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract was 1. 5 %. The anti-bacterial effect testing method was using diffusion method to differenciate inhibition zone of the green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract solution on various concentrations that were being tested and compare it with NaOCl 2. 5 %. Each group was replicated three times. The obtained data was analyzed with One Way Anova test and the continued with LSD test. The result of the study is that NaOCl 2. 5 % have superior anti-bacterial effect againts Enterococcus faecalis compared to green <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> extract...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tea</b> <b>leaf</b> {{contains}} {{very high}} level of polyphenols, mostly flavonoids, which distinguishes it from other plants. These flavonoids and their oxidative products formed during fermentation and drying, largely determine the color and taste of black tea. We studied the flavonoid content of various clones of tea and found it to correlate with chalcone synthase activity in the <b>tea</b> <b>leaf.</b> Induction of chalcone synthase (CHS) activity in the <b>tea</b> <b>leaf</b> was observed during the second flush, a period where flavonoids content of tea is highest in Assam. Expressions of enzymes viz. Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), cinnamyl CoA reductase (CCR) and Peroxidase (POD) involved in the synthesis of lignin were depressed during the second flush. These observations suggest that CHS may be a key enzyme involved in catechin biogenesis in <b>tea</b> <b>leaf.</b> This item was scanned with a HP 4850 Scanjet at 300 dpi and consists of 7 pages...|$|R
