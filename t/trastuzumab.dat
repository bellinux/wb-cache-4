5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as <b>trastuzumab.</b> There is an FDA black box warning that <b>trastuzumab</b> cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of <b>trastuzumab</b> and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, <b>trastuzumab,</b> and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the breast}} cancer {{medication}} <b>trastuzumab</b> can be analyzed as tras-tu-zu-mab. Therefore, the drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody used against a tumor.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. <b>Trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The chapter also {{examines}} celebrity {{endorsement of}} certain drugs, {{the extent to}} which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed. It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients who complain in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trastuzumab,</b> a {{monoclonal}} antibody to HER2 (a cell receptor that is especially active in some breast cancer cells), has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%). When stimulated by certain growth factors, HER2 causes cellular growth and division; {{in the absence}} of stimulation by the growth factor, the cell will normally stop growing. Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product, and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. When <b>trastuzumab</b> binds to the HER2 in breast cancer cells that overexpress the receptor, <b>trastuzumab</b> prevents growth factors from being able to bind to and stimulate the receptors, effectively blocking the growth of the cancer cells. <b>Trastuzumab,</b> however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of patients who receive it suffer significant heart damage). Further, <b>trastuzumab</b> is only effective in patients with HER2 amplification/overexpression.|$|E
25|$|In the {{advanced}} cancer setting, <b>trastuzumab</b> use {{in combination with}} chemotherapy can both delay cancer growth as well as improve the recipient's survival. Pertuzumab may work synergistically with <b>trastuzumab</b> on the expanded EGFR family of receptors, although it is currently only standard of care for metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} whose cancer expresses an over-abundance of the HER2 protein, a monoclonal antibody known as <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) {{is used to}} block {{the activity of the}} HER2 protein in breast cancer cells, slowing their growth.|$|E
25|$|Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an {{excellent}} prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation. HER2+ cancers should be treated with the <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) regime. Chemotherapy is uncommon for other types of stage 1 cancers.|$|E

Comparison of Quantitative Immunofluorescence with Conventional Methods for Her-2/neu testing With Respect to <b>Trastuzumab</b> Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer. Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 2008; 132, 1635-1647.|$|E
25|$|Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a {{progressively}} poorer prognosis {{and greater}} risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without lymph node removal), chemotherapy (plus <b>trastuzumab</b> for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).|$|E
25|$|In {{these trials}} DirectHit {{analysis}} of estrogen receptor and HER-2/neu displayed a higher predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes with anti estrogen drugs and <b>Trastuzumab</b> than standard methods. In addition DirectHit displayed exceptional predictive accuracy for chemotherapy response (88%). DirectHit also displayed an extreme specificity for predictions of drug resistance (100%).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to hormone receptors, {{there are other}} cell surface proteins that may affect prognosis and treatment. HER2 status directs the course of treatment. Patients whose cancer cells are positive for HER2 have a more aggressive disease and may be treated with the 'targeted therapy', <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that targets this protein and improves the prognosis significantly.|$|E
25|$|Important role (David Cameron as joint global Chief Investigator) in {{the pivotal}} {{clinical}} trial that tested {{the hypothesis that}} the combination of lapatinib and the cytotoxic drug capecitabine would be superior to capecitabine alone in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer that had progressed despite <b>trastuzumab</b> treatment. The results of this trial has led to a global (more than 100 countries) marketing authorisation of the drug lapatinib produced by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|The first {{approved}} drug of {{this type}} was gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), released by Wyeth (now Pfizer). The drug was approved to treat acute myeloid leukemia, but has now been withdrawn from the market because the drug did not meet efficacy targets in further clinical trials. Two other drugs, <b>trastuzumab</b> emtansine and brentuximab vedotin, are both in late clinical trials, and the latter has been granted accelerated approval {{for the treatment of}} refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{therapeutic}} market for monoclonal antibodies has grown exponentially. In 2006, the “big 5” therapeutic antibodies {{on the market}} are bevacizumab, <b>trastuzumab</b> (both oncology), adalimumab, infliximab (both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, ‘AIID’) and rituximab (oncology and AIID) accounted for 80% of revenues in 2006. In 2007, eight of the 20 best-selling biotechnology drugs in the U.S. are therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This rapid growth in demand for monoclonal antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as <b>trastuzumab</b> and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of breast cancer amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them. There is evidence from an in vitro study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the monoclonal antibody <b>trastuzumab,</b> can induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth.|$|E
25|$|Bevacizumab {{can also}} be {{combined}} with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes {{high blood pressure and}} proteinuria. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to fistulae or bowel perforation. Vintafolide, which consists of an antifolate conjugated with vinblastine, is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers. Another potential immunotherapy is <b>trastuzumab,</b> which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. Combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. Trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines, including TroVax.|$|E
25|$|Receptor status. Breast {{cancer cells}} have receptors on their surface {{and in their}} {{cytoplasm}} and nucleus. Chemical messengers such as hormones bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells {{may or may not}} have three important receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. ER+ cancer cells (that is, cancer cells that have estrogen receptors) depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. tamoxifen), and generally have a better prognosis. Untreated, HER2+ breast cancers are generally more aggressive than HER2- breast cancers, but HER2+ cancer cells respond to drugs such as the monoclonal antibody <b>trastuzumab</b> (in combination with conventional chemotherapy), and this has improved the prognosis significantly. Cells that do not have any of these three receptor types (estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or HER2) are called triple-negative, although they frequently do express receptors for other hormones, such as androgen receptor and prolactin receptor.|$|E

500|$|At {{the level}} of the EFS protein, a study of BT474 breast cancer cells found {{significant}} increases in expression of EFS and other proteins relevant to SRC kinase signaling, including CDCP1/Trask and Paxillin, in <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) resistant versus sensitive cells Importantly, EFS knockdown with siRNA restored <b>trastuzumab</b> sensitivity. [...] Reflecting the importance of post-translational modification of CAS proteins, in a study of cell lines and tumor tissue in malignant melanoma, EFS phosphorylation and activity significantly decreased (p<0.05) in response to vemurafenib treatment in BRAF wild-type melanoma tumors comparing to ones with BRAF (V600E-vemurfenib resistant) mutation. Finally, in a 2013 study of castration-resistant prostate cancer, EFS was identified as having significantly increased gross phosphorylation levels in samples from androgen-deprived (AD), long-term AD treated, or castration-resistant prostate carcinoma xenografts, versus in androgen deprivation therapy-naıve xenografts ...|$|E
500|$|... 225Ac {{is applied}} in {{medicine}} to produce 213 in a reusable generator {{or can be}} used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver {{for a period of}} tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to <b>trastuzumab,</b> a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma and prostate cancers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> (trade names Herclon, Herceptin) is a {{monoclonal}} antibody drug that {{interferes with the}} HER2/neu receptor. Its main use is to treat certain breast cancers. [...] This drug is only used if a patient's cancer is tested for over-expression of the HER2/neu receptor. Two tissue-typing tests are used to screen patients for possible benefit from Herceptin treatment. The tissue tests are immunohistochemistry(IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization(FISH) Only Her2+ patients will be treated with Herceptin therapy (<b>trastuzumab)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{branch in}} {{targeted}} therapy {{is the increasing}} use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. [...] "Humanization" [...] of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed {{the creation of a new}} family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. <b>Trastuzumab,</b> a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} occurs due {{to chronic}} inflammation. [...] The principal {{cause of the}} chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). [...] In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to {{the cells of the}} lower esophagus. Recently, bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [...] and the protein kinase enzyme Akt. This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex NF-κB (NFKB1), and ultimately activation of the homeobox gene CDX2, which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as guanylate cyclase 2C. This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> {{has had a}} [...] "major {{impact in}} the {{treatment}} of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer". The combination of <b>trastuzumab</b> with chemotherapy has been shown to increase both survival and response rate, in comparison to <b>trastuzumab</b> alone.|$|E
50|$|HER2 is {{the target}} of the {{monoclonal}} antibody <b>trastuzumab</b> (marketed as Herceptin). <b>Trastuzumab</b> is effective only in cancers where HER2 is over-expressed. One year of <b>trastuzumab</b> therapy is recommended for all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who are also receiving chemotherapy. An important downstream effect of <b>trastuzumab</b> binding to HER2 is an increase in p27, a protein that halts cell proliferation. Another monoclonal antibody, Pertuzumab, which inhibits dimerisation of HER2 and HER3 receptors, was approved by the FDA for use in combination with <b>trastuzumab</b> in June 2012.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> binds to domain IV of the {{extracellular}} {{segment of}} the HER2/neu receptor. Cells treated with <b>trastuzumab</b> undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle so there is reduced proliferation. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>trastuzumab</b> does not alter HER-2 expression, but downregulates activation of AKT. In addition, <b>trastuzumab</b> suppresses angiogenesis both by induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. One of the most relevant proteins that <b>trastuzumab</b> activates is the tumor suppressor p27 (kip1), also known as CDKN1B. <b>Trastuzumab</b> has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|HER2 {{testing is}} {{performed}} {{in breast cancer}} patients to assess prognosis and to determine suitability for <b>trastuzumab</b> therapy. It is important that <b>trastuzumab</b> is restricted to HER2-positive individuals as it is expensive and {{has been associated with}} cardiac toxicity. For HER2-negative tumours, the risks of <b>trastuzumab</b> clearly outweigh the benefits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> {{costs about}} US$70,000 {{for a full}} course of treatment, <b>Trastuzumab</b> brought in $327 million in revenue for Genentech {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2007.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} serious {{complications}} of <b>trastuzumab</b> is {{its effect on the}} heart, although this is rare. <b>Trastuzumab</b> is associated with cardiac dysfunction in 2-7% of cases which includes congestive heart failure. As a result, regular cardiac screening with either a MUGA scan or echocardiography is commonly undertaken during the <b>trastuzumab</b> treatment period. The decline in ejection fraction appears to be reversible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> emtansine is an antibody-drug {{conjugate}} (ADC), {{a combination}} between a monoclonal antibody and a small-molecule drug. Each molecule of <b>trastuzumab</b> emtansine {{consists of a}} single <b>trastuzumab</b> molecule with several molecules of DM1, a cytotoxic maytansinoid, attached. SMCC, or succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, is a heterobifunctional crosslinker, a type of chemical reagent that contains two reactive functional groups, a succinimide ester and a maleimide. The succinimide group of SMCC reacts with the free amino group of a lysine residue in the <b>trastuzumab</b> molecule and the maleimide moiety of SMCC links to the free sulfhydryl group of DM1, forming a covalent bond between the antibody and the DM1. Each <b>trastuzumab</b> molecule {{may be linked to}} zero to eight DM1 molecules (3.5 on average). DM1 binds at plus ends of cellular microtubules and thereby inhibits cell division in the target tumor cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trastuzumab</b> emtansine {{also known}} as ado-trastuzumab emtansine and sold under the trade name Kadcyla, is an antibody-drug {{conjugate}} consisting of the monoclonal antibody <b>trastuzumab</b> (Herceptin) linked to the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1). <b>Trastuzumab</b> alone stops growth of cancer cells by binding to the HER2/neu receptor, whereas DM1 enters cells and destroys them by binding to tubulin. <b>Trastuzumab</b> binding to Her2 prevents homodimerization or heterodimerization (Her2/Her3) of the receptor, ultimately inhibiting the activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt cellular signalling pathways. Because the monoclonal antibody targets HER2, and HER2 is only over-expressed in cancer cells, the conjugate delivers the toxin specifically to tumor cells. The conjugate is abbreviated T-DM1.|$|E
50|$|Approval {{was based}} on the EMILIA study, a phase III {{clinical}} trial that compared <b>trastuzumab</b> emtansine versus capecitabine (Xeloda) plus lapatinib (Tykerb) in 991 people with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had previously been treated with <b>trastuzumab</b> and taxane chemotherapy. This trial showed improved progression-free survival in patients treated with <b>trastuzumab</b> emtansine (median 9.6 vs. 6.4 months), along with improved overall survival (median 30.9 vs. 25.1 months) and safety.|$|E
50|$|Currently the {{recommended}} assays are {{a combination of}} IHC and FISH, whereby IHC scores of 0 and 1+ are negative (no <b>trastuzumab</b> treatment), scores of 3+ are positive (<b>trastuzumab</b> treatment), and score of 2+ (equivocal case) is referred to FISH for a definitive treatment decision. Industry best practices indicate the use of FDA-cleared Automated Tissue Image Systems by laboratories for automated processing of specimens, thereby reducing process variability, avoiding equivocal cases, and ensuring maximum efficacy of <b>trastuzumab</b> therapy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of trastuzumab-containing combination therapies (with chemotherapy, hormone blockers, or lapatinib) {{for the treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer. The overall hazard ratios for overall survival and progression free survival were 0.82 and 0.61, respectively. It was difficult to accurately ascertain the true impact of <b>trastuzumab</b> on survival, as in three of the seven trials, over half of the patients in the control arm were allowed to cross-over and receive <b>trastuzumab</b> after their cancer began to progress. [...] Thus, this analysis likely underestimates the true survival benefit associated with <b>trastuzumab</b> treatment in this population. In these trials, <b>trastuzumab</b> also increased the risk of heart problems, including heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction decline.|$|E
