5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line {{of the team that}} conceded the score.

As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the interaction.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E

5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the project in the 1940s. By the time the site of Fort Bayard was purchased in 1926, the remains of the fort had been demolished and homes were being built on the site.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. The H. L. Hunley, {{the first}} {{submarine}} to sink an enemy ship, {{was built in}} Mobile. One {{of the most famous}} naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E.

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|General Dong Zhuo (d.192 AD) {{found the}} young emperor {{and his brother}} {{wandering}} in the countryside.

After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian, Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong, who burned Luoyang {{to the ground and}} resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD. Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto {{started to}} unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of {{what would become the}} Popular Front. Lerroux's Radical {{government}} collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The elections of 1936 were won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E

It is not clear if the Mercians were involved in a battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} since the European elections of 1984 that the largest opposition party had failed to win the most seats. On the same day, Labour polled ahead of all other parties at the local elections, winning 31% of the vote and <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> six additional councils.|$|E
5|$|In <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the studio, General Tire {{restored}} RKO's {{links to}} broadcasting. General Tire {{had bought the}} Yankee Network, a New England regional radio network, in 1943. In 1950, it purchased the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System, and two years later, the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York City. The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of America's leading radio networks. General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio.|$|E
