However, on June 11, 2008, TxDOT announced they planned to limit further study of I-69 to existing highway corridors–U.S. 59, U.S. 77, U.S. 281, U.S. 84, and SH 44–outside transition zones in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Houston, and Texarkana. TxDOT also announced it was reverting to building I-69 as a standard 4-lane freeway instead of a multi-modal corridor as previously envisioned under the Trans-Texas <b>Corridor</b> <b>concept.</b> The latest plan called for adding a second carriageway and eliminating at-grade intersections along US-59 and US-77 in rural areas, with tolled bypasses around major cities and towns along the I-69 route.|$|R

Transport corridors have also been common practice in European transport policy since the creation of a borderless Europe in the 1990 s.

We argue that adopting such an approach is beneficial to a valued analysis of European transport corridors, especially in the light of EU cohesion policy, agglomeration effects and place-based development. Also, negative external effects of persisting bottlenecks on welfare and quality of life in transport corridors should be better assessed and contextualised.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to gain a better understanding of whether a freight <b>corridor</b> <b>concept,</b> as promoted by the EU TEN-T initiative, is feasible and sound and can be promoted to reduce the environmental (greenhouse gas) impact of long distance freight operation. Research has been conducted to investigate the characteristics of freight corridors across the European Union. This paper reports the analysis of freight corridor links from the UK and Ireland to Duisburg, Germany. This analysis is based on desktop research and interviews with UK freight operators. The findings suggest that the corridor is relatively green and, by its use, has the potential to attract greener freight flow. The key barriers are capacity bottlenecks on road and rail. We found that key improvement opportunities to promote the use of the green corridors are: the uptake of Channel Tunnel surplus capacity; released capacity on rail due to the planned high speed lines; better train management systems and the development of cleaner road transport...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{policies}} for managing river bank erosion {{are currently being}} reconsidered {{as a result of}} increased awareness regarding the unsustainable nature of some forms of bank protection, and the role played by bank erosion in providing ecosystem services and supporting geomorphological functions. River managers are therefore increasingly seeking to preserve bank erosion within a defined erodible corridor. This paper provides an overview of the erodible <b>corridor</b> <b>concept,</b> focusing on the provision of guidelines for applying the concept in practice. We argue that a nested approach is required to address management objectives across a range of scales (network scale, reach scale, local scale) and review the different geomorphic tools that are available to help managers define the extent and inner sensitivity of the erodible corridor. These tools include simple rules of thumb such as evaluation of the equilibrium meander amplitude, historical approaches based on overlays of historical channel position, and simulation modelling. The advantages and limitations of each of these tools are discussed...|$|R

In the present paper, it is proposed to organize main traffic flows in congested airspace along air streams which are characterized by a three - dimensional (3 D) common reference track and lateral lanes with a dynamic slot structure. There aircraft position is processed in a local space indexed axial coordinates system which should ease the management of traffic separation and surveillance. This change results in the need to develop new 3 D space indexed guidance modes to perform position tracking, as well as to design and assign standard trajectories to enter into, evolve inside and exit from the air stream while insuring time and space separation between aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{corridors}} {{are viewed}} as a promising way forward in European Union (EU) transport policy, assumed to contribute positively to regional economic development. However, the validity of this assumption is not evident. The aim {{of this paper is}} to empirically test whether agglomeration economies in European transport corridor regions are positively related to indicators of regional economic development compared to regions outside the scope of corridors. The results build on the notion that the type of agglomeration economy in combination with the structure of the economy matters for prospects of structural economic growth in different regions. In this way, the analysis not only contributes to enhancing the empirical scrutiny of the <b>corridor</b> <b>concept</b> in EU transport policy, but also provides new insights into how corridors contribute to regional economic growth. We find only limited evidence for a corridor effect across European regions on productivity and employment growth externalities. Instead, we find a large degree of spatial heterogeneity interacting with corridors—a heterogeneity that has been little recognized in EU policies. We suggest that recent attention to place-based development strategies may accord well with the kinds of agglomeration effects related to corridor development observed in this study...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} for running the proposed {{overhead transmission line}} Okroglo-Italian border. The Slovene and Italian methods are shown as methods enabling consideration of environmental and spatial impact within the process of planning overhead transmission line corridors. The Slovene method consists of analyses of attractiveness and vulnerability, whereby the first considers those functional and economic factors that affect spatial attractiveness for overhead transmission lines. Thus we can assess the level of economic and functional suitability of alternative routes of the proposed 400 kilovolt overhead transmission line from transformation station Okroglo (Slovenia) to Srednje, Golo Brdo and Vrtojba, three potential contact points on the Slovene–Italian border. In accordance with stipulations of the Law on spatial management vulnerability models were prepared, which were used to simulate the development’s potential negative environmental effects and to analyse suitability, which implies harmonisation of development and protection demands. Their result is a possible corridor that can be developed without significant conflicts. The Italian procedure was developed to trace the transmission line corridor from the Slovenian border to the transformation station in Udine. It was also applied on the Slovenian side. Three groups of factors were considered in the procedure: exclusion, repulsion, and attraction. The much simpler procedure enables comparisons, since it uses the same or at least similar spatial data.

Its objective was to investigate the impediments to elephant movement in the Nilgiri Hills, in the Western Ghats of India, in an attempt to suggest positive steps to encourage movement through the provision of corridors. The report was left unpublished, but given its importance as a reference document for the conservation of the Asian elephant in the Nilgiris, in 2011 the last two authors decided to publish it. The process of habitat fragmentation has been going on ever since man started agriculture. But this problem has, of late, become much more acute due to mounting pressure on land. The <b>corridor</b> <b>concept</b> applied to wildlife is the provision of a free and, as far as possible, unimpeded way for the passage of wild animals between two wildlife zones. A corridor’s more important function is to prevent wild animals from getting isolated in small pocket-like islands. Maintaining elephant habitat connectivity in and around the Nilgiris rests upon the understanding that elephant populations of the several protected areas of the now Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve must remain active. The first author surveyed the Nilgiris on foot and on elephant back for several months in 1978.

40|$|Background: Unstable phalangeal {{fractures}} {{are commonly}} treated with K-wire fixation. Operative fixation {{must be used}} judiciously and {{with the expectation that}} the ultimate outcome should be better than the outcome after nonoperative management. It is necessary to achieve a stable fracture fixation and early mobilization. In order to achieve this goal, one should closely understand the safe portals/corridors in hand for K-wire entry for fractures of the phalanges. Safe corridors were defined and tested using a pilot cadaveric and a clinical case study by assessing the outcome. Materials and Methods: In our prospective case series, 50 patients with 64 phalangeal fractures were treated with closed reduction and K-wires were inserted through safe portals identified by a pilot cadaveric study. On table active finger movement test was done and the results were analyed using radiology, disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score and total active motion (TAM). In our study, little finger (n = 28) was the most commonly involved digit. In fracture pattern, transverse (n = 20) and spiral (n = 20) types were common. Proximal phalanx (n = 38) was commonly involved and the common site being the base of the phalanx (n = 28). Results: 47 (95 %) patients had excellent TAM and the mean postoperative DASH score was 58. 05. All patients achieved excellent and good scores proving the importance of the safe <b>corridor</b> <b>concept.</b> Conclusion: K-wiring through the safe corridor has proved to yield the best clinical results because of least tethering of soft tissues as evidenced by performing "on-table active finger movement test" at the time of surgery.
