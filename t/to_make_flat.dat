25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>flat</b> panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E

Examples of fill-freeze electrodes are the E6012, E6013, and E7014, all of which provide a compromise between fast welding speeds and all-position welding.|$|E

50|$|For a spotface, {{material}} {{is removed from}} a surface <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>flat</b> and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast. A tool {{referred to as a}} counterbore is typically used to cut the spotface, although an endmill may also be used.

2500|$|David Cook, {{author of}} Understanding Jihad, said [...] "In reading Muslim {{literature}} – both contemporary and classical – {{one can see}} that the evidence for the primacy of spiritual jihad is negligible. Today it is certain that no Muslim, writing in a non- Western language (such as Arabic, Persian, Urdu), would ever make claims that jihad is primarily nonviolent or has been superseded by the spiritual jihad. Such claims are made solely by Western scholars, primarily those who study Sufism and/or work in interfaith dialogue, and by Muslim apologists who are trying to present Islam in the most innocuous manner possible." [...] Cook argued that [...] "Presentations along these lines are ideological in tone and should be discounted for their bias and deliberate ignorance of the subject" [...] and that [...] "t is no longer acceptable for Western scholars or Muslim apologists writing in non-Muslim languages <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>flat,</b> unsupported statements concerning the prevalence – either from a historical point of view or within contemporary Islam—of the spiritual jihad." [...] Magdi Allam, an outspoken Egyptian-born Italian journalist, has described Islam as intrinsically violent and characterized by [...] "hate and intolerance".|$|E

50|$|In the 1927 Tour de France, {{the team}} time trial format had been introduced, where teams started 15 minutes apart. This was done <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the <b>flat</b> stages more competitive.

It was first introduced to the American market in 1963 in competition with Saran Wrap.|$|E

5000|$|The same {{procedure}} {{is used to}} make printed circuit boards, foil-stamping dies and embossing dies.

A very high degree of precision is possible. In these applications, it is properly called photochemical machining, but the terms photochemical milling, chemical milling and photoetching are sometimes used. A similar process called photolithography is used to make integrated circuits.|$|E

50|$|Despite the work, the {{dampness}} {{problem was}} not solved.

50|$|Countershading, {{the use of}} {{different}} colors on upper and lower surfaces in graduating tones from a light belly to a darker back, is common in the sea and on land. It is sometimes called Thayer's law, after the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, who published a paper on the form in 1896 that explained that countershading paints out shadows to make solid objects appear flat, reversing the way that artists use paint <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>flat</b> paintings contain solid objects. Where the background is brighter than is possible even with white pigment, counter-illumination in marine animals, such as squid, can use light to match the background.|$|E
50|$|In the mornings, {{while the}} men are off hunting, the women and young {{children}} go {{off in search of}} termite nests and other grubs, which will later be roasted at the family hearths. The women also pursue frogs, terrestrial crabs, or caterpillars, or even look for vines that can be woven into baskets. While some women gather these small sources of food, other women go off and fish for several hours during the day. The women also prepare cassava, shredding the roots and expressing the toxic juice, then roasting the flour <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>flat</b> cakes, which they cook over a small pile of coals.|$|E

The coils position and current density is computed by Newton method...|$|R
50|$|In 1928, many stages {{were in the}} team-time-trial format, {{where the}} teams started separately. The Tour {{organisation}} had invented this rule <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the <b>flat</b> stages more competitive, but it had {{the effect that the}} public stopped following the race. Therefore, in 1929 the most stages were run in the normal format, except for stages 12, 19 and 20, the stages that were expected to be raced slower than 30 km/h.|$|R
