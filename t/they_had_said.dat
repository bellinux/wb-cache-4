25|$|Washington {{had heard}} that there were 500 poorly {{supplied}} French troops at Fort Duquesne, and thus he led the 300 Virginians out of Great Meadows on June 16 to widen the road, for he {{had been unable to}} convince the other chiefs to assist. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that they would also be unable to help the Virginians. Although he had lost Indian support, which made his troops more vulnerable to attack, Washington continued to widen the road towards Red Stone Creek.|$|E
500|$|Melvin {{defended his}} {{decision}} to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers, unwittingly or otherwise, might pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He said under cross-examination during the 1987 murder trial that, in his view, [...] "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left {{a lot to be}} desired"; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said. The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the court that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> and that [...] "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout August, all 258 sailors {{were taken}} to Camp Shoemaker and questioned. Forty-nine of the 50 [...] "mutineers" [...] were imprisoned in the camp's brig. Joe Small was placed in solitary confinement. Each of the men was interviewed by officers, {{sometimes}} {{in the presence of}} an armed guard. Questions focused on identifying [...] "ringleaders" [...] of the work-stoppage and on what was said by whom at the meeting on the prison barge. The men were asked to sign statements summarizing the interrogation, but the officer's version rarely matched the enlisted man's recollection of the interview. Some men, upon seeing that the written statements did not reflect what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> refused to sign. Others felt they {{had no choice but to}} signthey were being ordered to do so by an officer. Several men refused to give any statement at all. Others spoke freely, thinking that the officer was there as defense counsel.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
500|$|Disputes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} of the treaty led the Spartans to dispatch ambassadors to Athens with full powers to arrange all unsettled matters. The Athenians initially received these ambassadors well, but Alcibiades met with them in secret before they were to speak to the ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) and told them that the Assembly was haughty and had great ambitions. He urged them to renounce their diplomatic authority to represent Sparta, and instead allow him to assist them through his influence in Athenian politics. The representatives agreed and, impressed with Alcibiades, they alienated themselves from Nicias, who genuinely wanted to reach an agreement with the Spartans. The next day, during the Assembly, Alcibiades asked them what powers Sparta had granted them to negotiate and they replied, as agreed, that they had not come with full and independent powers. This was in direct contradiction to what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> the day before, and Alcibiades seized on this opportunity to denounce their character, cast suspicion on their aims, and destroy their credibility. This ploy increased Alcibiades's standing while embarrassing Nicias, and Alcibiades was subsequently appointed General. He took advantage of his increasing power to orchestrate the creation of an alliance between Argos, Mantinea, Elis, and other states in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta's dominance in the region. According to Gomme, [...] "it was a grandiose scheme for an Athenian general {{at the head of a}} mainly Peloponnesian army to march through the Peloponnese cocking a snook at Sparta when her reputation was at its lowest". This alliance, however, would ultimately be defeated at the Battle of Mantinea.|$|E

The jury heard extensive descriptions of the severity of the attack from a number of witnesses and through a recorded phone conversation taken at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In her heyday, Vyjayanthimala was {{the subject}} of many controversies, {{particularly}} for her misconstruded relationships with her co-stars. In the early 1960s, Vyjayanthimala was linked by gossip magazines with Dilip Kumar, who has acted with her the most compared to any other actress, which resulted in great on-screen chemistry between them. While working for his home production Gunga Jumna (1961), it is falsely said that Kumar handpicked the shade of sari that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene. In addition to that, film historians Bunny Reuben and Sanjit Narwekar have [...] "confirmed" [...] the Kumar & Vyjayanthimala's affair where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that Vyjayanthimala was Kumar's third love after Kamini Kaushal and Madhubala.|$|E

[...] This cartoon featured a nun using corporal punishment. [...] Some in the community have felt that this was a slight against the nuns and all their years of hard work. [...] Others, mainly middle age to older adults, have said that this was representative of the nuns who taught them while they were in school. [...] <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that some of the nuns freely used corporal punishment to enforce discipline.|$|E
2500|$|HKU Council {{chairman}} Edward Leong called Fung's leak a [...] "deplorable action", {{accusing him}} of using [...] "dishonest means to achieve his aim". He {{said that if the}} council discussions were open, it would discourage free discussion. [...] Other council members criticised Fung's integrity, but refused to reveal what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> during the meeting. Council members Lo Chung-mau and Arthur Li accused Fung of lying about the discussions. Leonie Ki, another council member, alleged that Fung's English language proficiency was so low that he could not understand what was being discussed during the council meetings. Three council members, including Ki, had spoken against Chan for making a high-profiled claim that he was the only candidate, whereas in fact the revelations were made only after a highly placed source leaked the fact to Wen Wei Po.|$|E

2500|$|Early in its mandate, the {{government}} implemented increases {{to the amount}} of care received by nursing home and homecare clients. [...] It also appointed Bernard Richard as Child and Youth Advocate, a position which had been vacant since its creation in 2005 {{as a result of a}} then-opposition Liberal-sponsored bill. [...] In December 2006, the province announced an agreement with private auto insurance companies that would see some restructuring of regulations and an average decrease of 13.5% in insurance rates by March 1, 2007. [...] The province also appointed several commissions to investigate larger issues: a Community Non-Profit Task Force, a Self-Sufficiency Task Force and a Commission on Post-Secondary Education. The Liberals however cancelled a tax rebate on energy costs brought forward by the previous government which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> they would maintain. The Liberals defended the move saying that the Conservatives had left the province's finances [...] "in a downward spiral" [...] and that the program was bad policy because it didn't encourage energy conservation.|$|E
2500|$|Anesthesiologist Isabella Herb {{found that}} a dose of 20% {{ethylene}} gas administered to a subject was a threshold. A dosage higher than 20% caused unconsciousness. [...] With less than 20% a trance was induced where the subject could sit up, hear questions and answer them logically, although the tone of their voice might be altered, their speech pattern could be changed, {{and they may have}} lost some awareness of their hands and feet (with some it was possible to have poked a pin or pricked them with a knife and they would not feel it). When patients were removed from the area where the gas accumulated they had no recollection of what had happened, or what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b> With a dosage of more than 20% the patient lost control over the movement of their limbs and may thrash wildly, groaning in strange voices, losing balance and frequently repeatedly falling. All of these symptoms match the experience of the Pythia in action, as related by Plutarch, who witnessed many prophecies.|$|E

Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it." [...] Taylforth has commented on the audition process, [...] " [...] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' they said. I said, 'I can look older. I'll put my hair up. I'll have a few late nights and I promise I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'."
