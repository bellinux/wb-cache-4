The first popular version of Scream Tracker, version 2.2, {{was published in}} 1990. Versions prior to 3.0 created STM (Scream <b>Tracker</b> <b>Module)</b> files, later ones used S3M (ScreamTracker 3 Module). The last version of Scream Tracker was 3.21 released in 1994.

50|$|The UltraSound cards gained great {{popularity}} in the PC tracker music community. The tracker format was originally developed on the Commodore Amiga personal computer in 1987, but due to the PC becoming more capable of producing high-quality graphics and sound, the demo scene spilled out onto the platform in droves and took the tracker format with it. Typical tracker formats of the era included MOD, S3M and, later, XM. The format stores the notes and the instruments digitally in the file instead of relying on a sound card to reproduce the instruments. A <b>tracker</b> <b>module,</b> when saved to disk, typically incorporates all the sequencing data plus samples, and typically the composer would incorporate his or her assumed name into the list of samples. This primitive precursor to the modern sampler {{opened the way for}} Gravis to enter the market, because the requirements matched the capabilities of the GF1 chip ideally. The problem with the other sound cards playing this format was that they had to downmix voices into one or both of its output channels in software, further deteriorating the quality of 8-bit samples in process. An UltraSound card was able to download the samples to its RAM and mix them using fast and high-quality hardware implementation, offloading the CPU from the task. Gravis realized early on that the demo scene support could be a sales booster, and they gave away 6000 cards for free to the most famous scene groups and people in the scene.|$|E

Our wavelet based approach for onset localization does not suffer from either smearing effects caused by windowing in the time domain nor from consistency problems caused by multiband level thresholding. Furthermore the method makes use of the beneficial effect of partial removal by adaptive signal cancelling. The results presented indicate that our approach is a promising basis for multicomponent acoustic signal separation. 1 System Architecture The fundamental signals considered in our approach are time limited sinusoid functions disturbed by Gaussian white noise.

40|$|A {{framework}} for the logical and statistical analysis and annotation of dynamic scenes containing occlusion and other uncertainties is presented. This framework consists of three elements; an object <b>tracker</b> <b>module,</b> an object recognition/classification module and a logical consistency, ambiguity and error reasoning engine. The principle behind the object tracker and object recognition modules is to reduce error by increasing ambiguity (by merging objects in close proximity and presenting multiple hypotheses). The reasoning engine deals with error, ambiguity and occlusion in a unified framework to produce a hypothesis that satisfies fundamental constraints on the spatio-temporal continuity of objects. Our algorithm finds a globally consistent model of an extended video sequence that is maximally supported by a voting function based on the output of a statistical classifier.
