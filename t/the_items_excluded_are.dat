The construct validity of <b>the</b> Rasch-reduced <b>item</b> set was evaluated. METHOD: Modified House Classification items were scored from 369 videotaped assessments of 159 children with unilateral CP (98 males, 61 females; median age 6 y 6 mo, range 2 y 1 mo- 17 y 5 mo). Construct validity was tested in 40 other children with unilateral CP (21 males, 19 females; median age 8 y 2 mo, range 3 y 3 mo- 17 y 6 mo) by comparing total scores with the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) and the ABILHAND-Kids scale. RESULTS: Fifteen MHC items could be included in the Rasch analysis. <b>The</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> either too easy or too difficult. Fourteen <b>items</b> fitted <b>the</b> unidimensional model (chi(2) = 41. 3, df= 39, p= 0. 37). The hierarchy of these items was different from the original MHC. There was a significant correlation with the MACS (r=- 0. 901, p< 0. 001) and the ABILHAND-Kids scale (r= 0. 558, p< 0. 001).

This adapted inventory is a self-report questionnaire for fathers and is used for establishing father&# 39;s perceptions of anxiety and avoidance in the attachment relationship with his child in early childhood.

This report focuses on {{the construct validity of}} the scale with the addition of two new items. MethodParticipants were 104 parents of preschoolers (3; 0 to 5; 11) who were typically fluent. <b>Items</b> on <b>the</b> preschooler's version of the SDQP were converted to measure parent inferred self-concept and two items were added that measured a fear dimension that had not been included in the SDQP. The factor structure of the parent scale was analyzed using an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. ResultsA six factor structure with three factors that were consistent with earlier research (physical abilities, physical appearance, and peer relationships) and three new factors (child- and parent initiated parent relationship factors, and pre-academic skills) emerged. <b>The</b> Fear <b>items</b> loaded most strongly on the Child-initiated Parent Relationship factor but in a negative direction (-. 637).

The instrument was grounded on the theoretical framework specified in Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Cognitive Domain and upon a model of the nature of science gleaned from the writings of several philosophers of science and compiled by the author. This theoretical grounding gave support to the instrument's content validity. [...] As an additional check on validity, a preliminary form of the test, containing ninety-one four alternative multiple-choice items, was given to a panel of ten validators, including practicing scientists, science educators, and an epistemologist. Using the results of their analysis, sixteen of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> test, several were modified, and an answer key was devised based upon 70 percent agreement among the panel members. The form of the test which resulted was administered to approximately two hundred fifty grade X and grade XI students and forty-five grades I to XI science teachers. [...] Both item and factor analyses of the student's responses indicated that the most plausible interpretation of {{the manner in which they}} answered the test was that their responses were essentially random.

30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} the one-factor model (model 1) had {{unacceptable}} fit in terms of χ 2 /df, confirming the multidimensionality of the data. Next, we tested three four-factor models: the original hierarchical model (Gomez & Fisher, 2003) and the orthogonal model and oblique models proposed by Fisher (2013). The four-factor oblique model proved a better fit to the data than the one-factor model {{and the other three}} four-factor models, but the fit indices still did not meet the criteria for acceptable model fit. Next model 5 (without items 6, 8 and 9, which did not load significantly on their respective target factors) was tested, in line with a previous validation study conducted in Portugal (Gouveia et al., 2009). Participants’ responses to <b>the</b> three <b>excluded</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> highly skewed, indicating that these items did not provide good discrimination. The means and SDs for these items were as follows: item 6 —mean =  4.32, SD[*]=[*] 1.05; item 8 —mean =  3.31, SD[*]=[*] 1.05 and item 9 —mean =  3.83, SD = . 89. The fit indices for model 5 were substantially better, but still marginally lower than the recommended thresholds. We then carried out post hoc re-specification of the best fitting factor structures, adding three error covariance terms (items 1 – 2, 4 – 5 and 17 – 19), based on modification indices and semantic similarity between items, to yield model 6. As Table  2 {{shows that the}} values of the fit indices were acceptable for model 6. We then tested model 7, which was derived from a second Portuguese validation study (Gouveia & Marques, 2012) which also eliminated <b>the</b> <b>items</b> which did not load significantly on their target factor (items 8, 9 and 15), but was not as good a fit to the data as model 6. Finally, based on modification indices, we added three error covariance terms (items 1 – 2, 4 – 5 and 17 – 19) to yield model 8, which presented acceptable fit indices. In summary, both models 6 and 8 provided an acceptable fit to the data; however, model 8 had a lower AIC, and the AIC is an index of parsimony, so this suggests that it is the simplest model which offers a good fit to the data analysed.|$|R

Tutors: Josep Fortiana i Jordi AlonsoObjective: To {{describe}} {{the methodology of}} Confirmatory Factor Analyis for categorical items and to apply this methodology to evaluate the factor structure and invariance of the WHO-Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-II) questionnaire, developed by the World Health Organization. Methods: Data used for the analysis come from the European Study of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional interview to {{a representative sample of}} the general population of 6 european countries (n= 8796). Respondents were administered {{a modified version of the}} WHODAS-II, that measures functional disability in the previous 30 days in 6 different dimensions: Understanding and Communicating; Self-Care, Getting Around, Getting Along with Others, Life Activities and Participation. The questionnaire includes two types of items: 22 severity items (5 points likert) and 8 frequency items (continuous). An Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with promax rotation was conducted on a random 50 % of the sample. The remaining half of the sample was used to perform a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in order to compare three different models: (a) the model suggested by the results obtained in the EFA; (b) the theoretical model suggested by the WHO with 6 dimensions; (c) a reduced model equivalent to model b where 4 of <b>the</b> frequency <b>items</b> <b>are</b> <b>excluded.</b> Moreover, a second order factor was also evaluated. Finally, a CFA with covariates was estimated in order to evaluate measurement invariance of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> between Mediterranean and non-mediterranean countries. Results: The solution that provided better results in the EFA was that containing 7 factors. Two of <b>the</b> frequency <b>items</b> presented high factor loadings in the same factor, and one of them presented factor loadings smaller than 0. 3 with all the factors. With regard to the CFA, the reduced model (model c) presented the best goodness of fit results (CFI= 0. 992,TLI= 0. 996, RMSEA= 0. 024). The second order factor structure presented adequate goodness of fit (CFI= 0. 987, TLI= 0. 991, RMSEA= 0. 036). Measurement non-invariance was detected for one of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> of <b>the</b> questionnaire (FD 20 ¿ Embarrassment due to health problems).

40|$|How {{people make}} sense of the world around them via the {{categories}} they use is a question that social science researchers frequently attempt to address through their investigations (e. g., Spradley, 1970). One prevalent approach in organizational research is the rep grid method (Reger, 1990). This technique, based upon Kelly's (1955) role construct repertory test, asks participants to sort items (e. g., people, recent events, or artifacts) within a three-member group into subgroups based on participant-defined similarity and dissimilarity. The researcher's main task, therefore, is to inquire about the characteristics or conditions that each participant uses to sort these itemsâ what is similar among <b>the</b> paired <b>items</b> and what makes the pair different from <b>the</b> <b>item</b> that <b>is</b> <b>excluded.</b> Reger (1990) remarks that such an approach creates conditions in which "the researcher's frame of reference and worldview would not be imposed upon the respondent" (301). In information and library science (ILS) research, individuals' uses of categories for sense-making are viewed as being closely coupled to their interactions with available information resources, services, or systems. Sorting tasks are one general class of methods used to uncover the categories that users employ during these interactions. In information systems research, Tan and Hunter (2002) discuss qualitative and quantitative applications of the rep grid method. While other sorting tasks in ILS research do not explicitly share the same intellectual lineage as the rep grid method, the general approaches and outcomes are largely consistent. Kwasnik (1991) studied how users classify personal documents based on criteria other than document attributes. She asked participants to provide a 'guided tour' of an office location along with a document sorting process, and, in reflection, she notes that "people are able to articulate the process by which [...] . decisions were made, and the data produced by this articulation lend themselves to analysis at a level which can yield general rules about the behaviour" (389). The qualitative analysis from Kwasnik's (1991) study can be contrasted with quantitative analyses of sort data used for guidance in the design of information displays (Carlyle, 2001) and interoperable metadata schema (Tennis, 2003). The rep grip method and other sorting tasks represent alternative approaches to direct questioning through standard qualitative interviewing. In this presentation, the authors will review various ways in which sorting techniques have been employed in ILS research, highlight how these methods are applied in their research (e. g., Edwards, forthcoming), suggest strategies for the inclusion of these tasks in study designs, and describe unique challenges encountered during data collection and analysis...|$|R

The interrater agreement of <b>the</b> individual <b>items</b> of AMSTAR was moderate with a mean kappa of 0. 50 (95 % CI: 0. 26, 0. 73). The ICC for AMSTAR against OQAQ (total score of 9 <b>items,</b> <b>excluding</b> <b>item</b> 10) <b>was</b> 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 76, 0. 93). Conclusions. Although there is room for improvement on few <b>items,</b> <b>the</b> new tool is reliable, valid, and easy to use for methodological quality assessment of systematic reviews on TCM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a brief {{questionnaire}} to measure fears about recurrence and health in cancer survivors. Research involving fear of recurrence has been increasing, indicating that it is an important concern among cancer survivors. Methods We developed and tested a six-item instrument, the Assessment of Survivor Concerns (ASC). Construct validity was examined in a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with 592 short-term and 161 long-term cancer survivors. Convergent and discriminant validity was examined through comparisons with the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) and the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression) measures. Results CFA models for the ASC with short- and long-term survivors showed good fit, with equivalent structure across both groups of cancer survivors. Convergent and discriminant validity was also supported through analyses of the PANAS and CES-D. One item (children's health worry) did not perform as well as the others, so the models <b>were</b> re-run with <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>excluded,</b> and <b>the</b> overall fit was improved. Conclusion The ASC showed excellent internal consistency and validity. We recommend the revised five-item instrument as an appropriate measure for assessment of cancer survivor worries. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{peace talks}} were {{formally}} installed in Oslo, Norway on October 18, 2012 {{and moved to}} their permanent location in Havana in November. FARC chief negotiator Iván Márquez's speech at the installation of dialogues in Oslo in October was interpreted by the Colombian media as unexpectedly radical for its defiant tone against <b>the</b> government, mentioning <b>items</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> agenda (economic model, foreign investment, military doctrine, mining, land ownership) and defending the armed struggle.|$|R
30|$|All items {{underwent}} item analyses {{procedures and}} needed to meet the criteria set for item discrimination (. 25) and item difficulty (. 40) before they were included for data analysis. For the instructor-developed test, all <b>the</b> <b>items</b> except one yes/no question met the set criteria, and thus only one <b>item</b> <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> data analysis. For the school-wide administered test, since all test <b>items</b> met <b>the</b> set criteria, all {{were included in the}} data analysis. Finally, the Cronbach’s α for the instructor-developed and school-wide tests were 0.93 and 0.98, respectively, indicating their high reliability.|$|R
30|$|After the rater analysis, 17 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> scale (three <b>items</b> for not {{representing}} the construct adequately, and 14 items for not meeting the required agreement level of 80  % among the experts). <b>The</b> remaining 42 <b>items</b> {{were sent to}} semantic analysis (Pasquali 2003), and {{the results from this}} analysis were combined with a critical review of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> in order {{to improve the quality of}} the scale. Finally, the operational version of the scale was created with 42 items, split up into four dimensions: 15 items to measure Voluntarism, nine items to Individual Initiative, 15 items to Extra Commitment, and three items to Organizational Defense.|$|R
30|$|For numeracy, the Infit {{statistic}} {{obtained from}} the unidimensional 1 PL model was between 0.69 and 1.37 for all <b>items.</b> <b>The</b> Outfit statistic was between 0.01 and 1.29 for all items except for two with values of 2.23 and 14.67. These two <b>items</b> <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> following analyses. Comparing the expected and observed item characteristic curves indicated that the model fit the data acceptably (see sample items in Fig.  4, middle). Observations were only available for {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> <b>item</b> characteristic curve for most items, indicating that items were very difficult and were completed by most participants in the mode of engagement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Currently, {{there is}} a lot of {{interest}} in the flexible framework offered by item banks for measuring patient relevant outcomes. However, there are few item banks, which have been developed to quantify functional status, as expressed by the ability to perform activities of daily life. This paper examines the measurement properties of the Academic Medical Center linear disability score item bank in a mixed population. Methods This paper uses item response theory to analyse data on 115 of 170 items from a total of 1002 respondents. These were: 551 (55 %) residents of supported housing, residential care or nursing homes; 235 (23 %) patients with chronic pain; 127 (13 %) inpatients on a neurology ward following a stroke; and 89 (9 %) patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Results Of <b>the</b> 170 <b>items,</b> 115 were judged to be clinically relevant. Of these 115 items, 77 were retained in <b>the</b> <b>item</b> bank following <b>the</b> <b>item</b> response theory analysis. Of <b>the</b> 38 <b>items</b> that <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from <b>the</b> <b>item</b> bank, 24 had either been presented to fewer than 200 respondents or had fewer than 10 % or more than 90 % of responses in the category 'can carry out'. A further 11 items had different measurement properties for younger and older or for male and female respondents. Finally, 3 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because <b>the</b> <b>item</b> response theory model did not fit the data. Conclusion The Academic Medical Center linear disability score item bank has promising measurement characteristics for the mixed patient population described in this paper. Further studies will be needed to examine the measurement properties of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> bank in other populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Container Loading Problem (CLP) {{literature}} has traditionally evaluated the dynamic stability of cargo by applying two metrics to box arrangements: {{the mean number}} of boxes supporting <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>excluding</b> those placed directly on the floor (M 1) and the percentage of boxes with insufficient lateral support (M 2). However, these metrics, that aim to be proxies for cargo stability during transportation, fail to translate real-world cargo conditions of dynamic stability. In this paper two new performance indicators are proposed to evaluate the dynamic stability of cargo arrangements: the number of fallen boxes (NFB) and the number of boxes within the Damage Boundary Curve fragility test (NB_DBC). Using 1500 solutions for well-known problem instances found in the literature, these new performance indicators are evaluated using a physics simulation tool (StableCargo), replacing the real-world transportation by a truck with a simulation of the dynamic behaviour of container loading arrangements. Two new dynamic stability metrics that can be integrated within any container loading algorithm are also proposed. The metrics are analytical models of the proposed stability performance indicators, computed by multiple linear regression. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient was used as an evaluation parameter for the performance of the models. The extensive computational results show that the proposed metrics are better proxies for dynamic stability in the CLP than the previous widely used metrics...|$|R
