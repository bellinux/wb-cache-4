5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E
5|$|Calan Gaeaf, {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It {{has largely been}} replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day).|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the soundtrack}} to <b>The</b> <b>Supernaturals</b> was scored by Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees. The score was rejected, though, {{in favour of}} one written by Robert O. Ragland. Gibb {{can be seen in}} <b>The</b> <b>Supernaturals</b> in a cameo role as a Union soldier.|$|R

5|$|The French Revolution (17891799) brought {{sweeping}} changes to theatre in France. Banished were the ballets the aristocracy preferred about {{the gods and}} goddesses of Mount Olympus. Instead, ballets about everyday people, real places, real time, the historical past, and <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> took prominence. These sorts of ballets were preferred by the burgeoning middle class.|$|E
5|$|The album's concept compares {{a violent}} storm to a roller coaster; its lyrical themes vary from horrorcore-based {{character}} deconstructions and songs about <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> to humorous and lighter subject matter. Clark's production was praised by critics, and the album peaked at #20 on the Billboard 200. It is the group's 23rd overall release.|$|E

5|$|The couple {{married on}} June 16, 1956, at St George the Martyr, Holborn (now in the London Borough of Camden) with Plath's mother in attendance, and spent their honeymoon in Benidorm, Spain.

5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
25|$|The were-jaguar motif is {{characterized}} by almond-shaped eyes, a downturned open mouth, and a cleft head. It appears widely in the Olmec archaeological record, and in many cases, under the principle of pars pro toto, the were-jaguar motif represents <b>the</b> were-jaguar <b>supernatural.</b> <b>The</b> were-jaguar <b>supernatural</b> incorporates <b>the</b> were-jaguar motif {{as well as other}} features, although various academics define <b>the</b> were-jaguar <b>supernatural</b> differently. <b>The</b> were-jaguar <b>supernatural</b> was once considered to be the primary deity of the Olmec culture but is now thought to be only one of many.|$|R

5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E
5|$|Jay Wolpert {{developed}} a script {{based on the}} theme park ride in 2001, and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer {{became involved in the}} project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> curse to the storyline. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed around Los Angeles, California. It was also significant in being the first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA.|$|E

5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and <b>the</b> <b>supernatural.</b> Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look {{were the result of}} functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting were put in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> elements, which are bright and geometric.|$|E
5|$|Plots {{are often}} {{set in motion}} by events, ranging from the fairly typical to <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> and extraordinary, which {{frequently}} happen in the town. The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to vociferation. The boys are also frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E

5|$|Sacred groves {{exist in}} China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They {{are places where}} the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves {{may be the only}} relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Seeking revenge {{after his}} wife Mary was killed by the demon Azazel, John Winchester became a hunter and raised his two sons to fight <b>the</b> <b>supernatural.</b> John disappears early in Supernatural, and the first season {{revolves}} primarily around Sam and Dean trying to find him. Morgan was also filming episodes of Grey's Anatomy while the first season of Supernatural was under production, and future appearances of the character were hindered by his busy schedule. While Morgan's portrayal has been praised, fans and critics were generally frustrated at the character for keeping so many secrets.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works.

He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
