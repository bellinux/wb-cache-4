5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail {{to the post}} offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was {{left out of the}} main route and put {{at the end of a}} branch route of <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E

The new contracts were paid on the basis of weight, at a rate substantially higher than paid by the United States Post Office.

50|$|For a time, <b>the</b> cypherpunks <b>mailing</b> {{list was}} a popular tool with mailbombers, who would {{subscribe}} a victim to <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list in order to cause a deluge of messages {{to be sent to}} him or her. (This was usually done as a prank, in contrast to the style of terrorist referred to as a mailbomber.) This precipitated <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list sysop(s) to institute a reply-to-subscribe system. Approximately two hundred messages a day was typical for <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list, divided between personal arguments and attacks, political discussion, technical discussion, and early spam.|$|R

5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered.

Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> room flooded, <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water.

50|$|There was {{controversy}} over the copying of <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list data from the old server to create <b>the</b> new <b>mailing</b> list of Google Groups. This was raised {{as a violation of}} the UK Data Protection Act by Luke Leighton. Whether this was actually a legal violation is not really clear and is open to interpretation. This was a community driven open source project. According to many in the community, both Luke and Anthony were co-administrators of the project and co-leads to it. It was being forked by a team including Anthony, one of the administrators who had privileges for the server, which Luke Leighton owned. <b>The</b> <b>mailing</b> list was part of the domain. So the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list data itself isn't very clear. Though Luke claims he personally owned <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list and that using it to create a new <b>mailing</b> list for <b>the</b> new pyjs.org fork of the project constituted stealing, many in the community feel differently. Many feel that this was an open source community project and Luke Leighton was a co-lead and co-administrator. Hence <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list was actually a community property of the pyjs.org community and not the personal property of Luke.|$|R
