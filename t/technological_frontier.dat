40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{three new}} methodologies in empirical production economics for assessing technical change, production risks, and <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers.</b> Each methodology is demonstrated with an application to Maryland dairy operations, {{with an emphasis}} on comparing production technologies between confinement and management-intensive grazing (MIG) dairy systems. The rapid decline of small to medium scale dairies has made the study of alternative dairy production like MIG politically and socially important. The first essay develops a regression-based approach to the Malmquist produc-tivity index (MPI) decomposition that attributes production heterogeneity to techni-cal change (i. e., shifts of <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers)</b> and technical efficiency change (i. e., shifts of technical efficiency). Unlike the conventional, producer-level decomposition measures, the proposed method obtains sample-level decomposition measures, for which the researcher can fully utilize unbalanced panel data and control for the in-fluence of potentially-confounding non-production factors. The results find 1. 3 % and 0. 6 % annual technical change during 1995 - 2009 for confinement and grazers respec...|$|R

40|$|This paper examines, {{through the}} use of plant-level data, whether R&D’s {{productivity}} impact is contingent on the distance of a plant’s productivity from the industry’s <b>technological</b> <b>frontier.</b> R&D is specified as an accumulated stock from R&D investments. We analyse the productivity effect of a plant’s own R&D as well as the productivity impact of the plant’s parent firm’s and other firms’ proximity-weighted R&D stocks. The results show that a plant’s own and a parent firm’s R&D have a positive productivity impact and that the former impact decreases as the distance from the industry’s <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> increases. Furthermore, the productivity effect of other firms’ proximity-weighted R&D is, on average, positive, but this impact increases in the distance from the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier.</b> Another important finding is that all the plants tend to converge towards the industry’s <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> despite the size of external R&D spillovers. ...|$|E

The cost of research differs across industries, so financing constraints hinder productivity growth in some industries more than in others. Equilibrium industry dynamics map into a differences-indifferences regression specification where industry growth depends on the interaction between country financial development and industry R&D intensity.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether a}} firm’s absorptive capacity and its {{distance from the}} <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> affect the choice between innovation and imitation in innovative Spanish firms. From an extensive survey of 5, 575 firms during the 2004 - 2009 period, we found two significant results. With regard {{to the role of}} absorptive capacity, the empirical evidence shows that when innovative firms have difficulties in accessing external information and hire skilled workers, their innovative capacity is reduced. Meanwhile, with regard to distance from the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier,</b> the firms that reduce this gap manage to increase their innovative capacity at the expense of imitation. To summarise, when we studied firms’ absorptive capacity and their relative position to the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> in tandem, we found that the two factors directly affected firms' ability to innovate or imitate.

We investigate theoretically and empirically how financial constraints affect a firm's innovation and export activities, using unique firm survey data which provides direct measures for innovations and firm-specific financial constraints. We find that financial constraints restrain the ability of domestically owned firms to innovate and export and hence {{to catch up to}} the <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers.</b> This negative effect is amplified as financial constraints force export and innovation activities to become substitutes although they are generally natural complements. ...|$|R
30|$|These {{concepts}} {{suggest that}} latecomer firms should move beyond imitation {{and focus on}} radical innovation {{if they want to}} be able to “catch up,” rather than merely “keep up,” with incumbents (Hobday 1995). A large number of studies have focused on knowledge searching, technological learning, and technological capability development (Cho et al. 1998; Hobday 1995; Kim 1998; Mathews and Cho 1999). As latecomer firms approach <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers,</b> incumbent firms in developed countries are more reluctant to share their technology; the technology itself is also increasingly complex (Chang et al. 2006). These challenges will make it much more difficult for latecomer firms to absorb knowledge spillover from firms in developed countries. To catch up with incumbents, then, latecomer firms need to leverage their existing knowledge base and capabilities to achieve radical innovation and create new knowledge.|$|R
30|$|Research in {{strategic}} management and innovation suggests {{that part of}} the base for heterogeneity in innovative capabilities resides in firms' search behaviors for new products (Cyert and March [1963]; Nelson and Winter [1982]; March [1991]; Katila and Ahuja [2002]). Firms tend to conduct local search around current areas of expertise (March [1991]; Stuart and Podolny [1996]) due to the effects of outcome predictability, cost efficiency, and technological confidence associated with internal exploitation (March [1991]). However, local search may constrain a firm's sensitivity to external changes in customer tastes, <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers,</b> and competitive dynamics, which may turn core competence into core rigidities (Leonard-Barton [1992]). To avoid such competency traps, firms attempt to explore knowledge elements that reside outside their current technological domains and their organizational boundaries (Katila and Ahuja [2002]; Rosenkopf and Nerkar [2001]).|$|R

Under {{the hypothesis that the}} economy is initially at the steady state and that the cohort of workers perfectly anticipates the shift in the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> between t− 1 and t, we can easily compute the tax rate paid by the cohort when workers were young as well as the working decision and the tax rate paid by this same cohort of workers when they become old and the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> shifts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between trade liberalization and economic growth using a Schum-peterian framework of technological innovation. The framework illustrates direct and indirect effects of trade libaralization on productivity growth.

In addition, results confirm that the greatest positive impact of trade liberalization will be on sectors close to the international <b>technological</b> <b>frontier.</b> Sectors with low product market competition and smaller scale of production benefit most significantly from trade liberalization. Results also confirm that sectors close to the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> and that have greater product market competition, and sectors of greater scale and high product market competition experience higher productivity growth.

Retirement decisions remain very close to the ones in the second row, when we were only considering a shift on the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier.</b> As a result, taxes are also barely modified.|$|E

40|$|Nanomaterials find {{increasing}} {{application in}} communications, renewable energies, electronics and sensing. Because of its unsurpassed speed and highly tuneable interaction with matter, using light {{to guide the}} self-assembly of nanomaterials can open up novel <b>technological</b> <b>frontiers.</b> However, large-scale light-induced assembly remains challenging. Here we demonstrate an efficient route to nano-assembly through plasmon-induced laser threading of gold nanoparticle strings, producing conducting threads 12 ± 2 nm wide. This precision is achieved because the nanoparticles are first chemically assembled into chains with rigidly controlled separations of 0. 9 nm primed for re-sculpting. Laser-induced threading occurs {{on a large scale}} in water, tracked via a new optical resonance in the near-infrared corresponding to a hybrid chain/rod-like charge transfer plasmon. The nano-thread width depends on the chain mode resonances, the nanoparticle size, the chain length and the peak laser power, enabling nanometre-scale tuning of the optical and conducting properties of such nanomaterials...|$|R
40|$|This paper tests a neo-Schumpeterian {{model with}} industry-level data to analyze how Brazil, India, and China are {{catching}} up with South Korea’s <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> in a globalized world. The paper validates Aghion et al. ’s inverted-U hypothesis that industries that are closer to the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> innovate to escape competition while longer distances discourage innovating. It suggests that for effective catching up, distance-shortening (or innovation-enhancing) policies may be a necessary complement to liberalization. South Korea and China combined a variety of distance-shortening policies with financial subsidies to promote high tech industries and an export-led growth strategy. Post-liberalization, they leveraged swift competition to spur catch-up. In comparison, Brazil, which was as rich as South Korea, and India, which was as rich as China in 1980, are catching up more slowly. Import-substitution industrialization strategies saddled Brazil and India with a large anti-export bias, and unfocused attention to innovation-enhancing policies dampened global competitiveness. Post liberalization, many of their industries were too far behind the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> to effectively benefit from competition. The catch-up experiences of Brazil, India, and China with South Korea illustrate that distance from the <b>technological</b> <b>frontier</b> matters and that the design of country-specific distance- shortening policies {{can be an important}} complement to trade liberalization in promoting {{catching up with}} richer countries.
