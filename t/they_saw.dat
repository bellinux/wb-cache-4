5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E

5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax.

5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> and heard what had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|Director Mike Nichols, who {{had seen}} Cher onstage in Jimmy Dean, offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film Silkwood.

For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E

This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E

30|$|The {{participant}} {{would watch}} vectors being {{drawn from a}} circular “start point” with a dynamic measurement under the point. The simulation was nicely scaffolded for the participants, such that <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> two vectors drawn in a gray shade in an animation, <b>they</b> then <b>saw</b> yellow vectors created {{on top of the}} gray shadowed ones, as if the vectors were being hand drawn. Two errors were always included in the sequence of eight trials.|$|R

5|$|Fleeing {{religious}} persecution and political turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys {{emigrated to the}} United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during {{the last ten years}} of his life.|$|E

5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State.

Unseen by anyone, the Idumeans entered the gate, marched through the city, and approached the Temple. Then they fell upon our guards, while the Zealots attacked them from behind.|$|R
60|$|There was no rest. Across the lake, a mile above {{a roaring}} torrent, they located {{a patch of}} spruce and built their saw-pit. Here, by hand, with an {{inadequate}} whipsaw, <b>they</b> <b>sawed</b> the spruce- trunks into lumber. They worked night and day. Thrice, on the night-shift, underneath in the saw-pit, Old Tarwater fainted. By day he cooked as well, and, in the betweenwhiles, helped Anson {{in the building of}} the boat beside the torrent as the green planks came down.|$|R
