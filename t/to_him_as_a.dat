5|$|DeGrom {{initially}} {{refused to}} sign the 2016 contract for the $607,000 salary assigned <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> third-year player not yet eligible for arbitration, deGrom was bound by the MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement to accept the salary assigned {{to him by his}} club. He eventually relented and reluctantly capitulated to signing his contract early in spring training.|$|E
5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming {{that since he}} held some lands from de Braose, {{it would be an}} act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal {{does not seem to have}} embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E

5|$|Roundtree had {{scholarship}} {{offers from}} Eastern Michigan, Illinois, Purdue, Nebraska and Miami. He {{was considered a}} Purdue commit until getting a late scholarship offer from Michigan, which was his preferred school. On signing day, his uncle convinced {{him to go to}} Michigan because of its winning tradition. The late switch led Purdue head coach Joe Tiller to cast aspersions on Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez, referring <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> snake oil salesman.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E

5|$|Leofric was {{probably}} born in Cornwall, {{and his parents}} were English. Because canon law required that a bishop be 30 years old when consecrated, {{it is likely that}} Leofric was born before 1016. The medieval chronicler Florence of Worcester referred <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brytonicus, which presumably meant that he was a native of Cornwall. He had a brother, Ordmaer, who acted as his steward and administered the family estates. Leofric was educated in Lotharingia, and may have been brought up abroad. Leofric may have gone into exile either in 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark invaded England or in 1016, when Sweyn's son Cnut became king of England. His education possibly took place at the church of St Stephen's in Toul, where the future Pope Leo IX was a canon from 1017 to 1024 and bishop after 1027.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or {{if it had been}} the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be more reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E

5|$|Using his {{profits and}} {{possibly}} the proceeds of tithing paid <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> LDS church representative, Brannan bought land from Sutter in the Sacramento area. Around this same time Brannan established ship trade with China, Hawaii, and the east coast. His land holdings extended to southern California and to Hawaii where, in 1851, he visited and purchased large amounts of land in Honolulu. He and other landowners and speculators raised the price of Californian land considerably, angering many. The disagreement escalated during 1850 into the Squatters' Riot, during which the squatter's spokesman, Doctor Charles L. Robinson, was shot, along with others. Nine people were killed. Brannan was considered the instigator of the incident.|$|E
5|$|Months later, a {{man known}} as Yukishiro Enishi starts attacking {{all the people}} Kenshin meets {{as an act of}} revenge for the death of his sister Yukishiro Tomoe. At this point, it is {{revealed}} that Kenshin was married to Tomoe in the Bakumatsu, but accidentally killed her while trying to rescue her from a group of assassins. When Enishi learns of Kenshin's feelings towards Kaoru, he sets out to kidnap her. He succeeds and leaves behind a professionally made decoy of Kaoru with a sword in her heart, making everyone believe that she has been murdered. Kenshin falls into a severe depression and runs off to a village of wanderers to mourn. However, he comes out of his depression after his friends discover Kaoru is alive. The group goes to rescue her on Enishi's island. A battle between Kenshin and Enishi follows. When Kenshin wins, he and Kaoru return home. Afterwards, Kenshin learns that since the Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū is only suitable for a wide-framed muscular build like that of Seijūrō's, his body will eventually begin to deteriorate and he will soon be unable to use it again. Five years later, Kenshin is married to Kaoru and has a son named Kenji. After an encounter with Kaoru's student Myōjin Yahiko, Kenshin gives his sakabatō <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift for his coming-of-age.|$|E
