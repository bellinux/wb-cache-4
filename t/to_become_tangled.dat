2500|$|Various {{types of}} smooth wire fencing, {{particularly}} when {{supported by a}} strand of electric fence, {{can be used to}} enclose a large pasture of several acres, {{and is one of the}} least expensive fencing options. [...] A wire fence should have at least four, preferably five strands to provide adequate security. [...] However, even without sharp barbs, wire has the highest potential for horses <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> in the fence and injured.

2500|$|Although {{acknowledging}} {{a number}} of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert {{that they have a}} tendency under some circumstances <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> with state-building efforts. [...] In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace. [...] These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit. [...] Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of [...] "neotrusteeship," [...] which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.|$|E
2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a top rail of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a mesh fence. [...] Mesh fencing needs to be heavy-gauge wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E

Pilot and machine dropped to the ground. The pilot walked away unharmed. Unable to stick to the tight development schedule that its backers demanded, Trek Aerospace lost funding, forcing reorganization in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Silk reeling (pinyin chánsī, Wade-Giles ch'an² ssu1 纏絲) {{refers to}} a set of neigong内功 (internal) {{movement}} principles expressed in traditional styles of chi ch'uan太極拳, but especially emphasised by the Chen陳 and Wu styles. The name derives from the twisting and spiralling movements of the silkworm larva as it wraps itself in its cocoon, and to the metaphorical principle of [...] "reeling the silk from a silk worm's cocoon". In order to draw out the silk successfully the action must be smooth and consistent without jerking or changing direction sharply. Too fast, the silk breaks, too slow, it sticks <b>to</b> itself and <b>becomes</b> <b>tangled.</b> Thus silk reeling movements are continuous, cyclic, spiralling patterns performed at constant speed with the [...] "light touch" [...] of drawing silk. Silk reeling is trained in solo forms and stances as well as in pushing hands with a partner.|$|R
60|$|Lane {{could not}} catch the low reply. He lingered there a while longer, and then {{returned}} to the hall, much surprised to find it so dark he could scarcely distinguish the dancers. The lights had been lowered. If the dance had been violent and strange before this procedure, it was now a riot. In the semi-darkness the dancers cut loose. The paper strings had been loosened and had fallen down <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> with the flying feet and legs. Confetti swarmed like dark snowdrops in the hot air. Lane actually smelled the heat of bodies--a strangely stirring and yet noxious sensation. A rushing, murmuring, shrill sound--voices, laughter, cries, and the sliding of feet and brushing of gowns--filled the hall--ominous to Lane's over-sensitive faculties, swelling unnaturally, the expression of unrestrained physical abandon. Lane walked along the edge of this circling, wrestling melee, down to the corner where the orchestra held forth. They seemed actuated by the same frenzy which possessed the dancers. The piccolo player lay on his back on top of the piano, piping his shrill notes at the ceiling. And Lane made sure this player was drunk. On the moment then the jazz came to an end with a crash. The lights flashed up. The dancers clapped and stamped their pleasure.|$|E

For an hour or two she found the walking easy enough, but then the forest, which in this part was unknown <b>to</b> her, <b>became</b> badly <b>tangled.</b> The trees were thicker and creeping vines intertwined between them. She had to turn this way and that to get through at all, and finally she came to a place where a network of vines and branches effectually barred her farther progress.|$|R

There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> or snarled. Splicing could be performed by knotting together the cut wire ends, but the results were not very satisfactory.|$|E

5000|$|Most spinners (who use {{spinning}} wheels) ply from bobbins. This {{is easier}} than plying from balls because there is less chance for the yarn <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> and knotted if it is simply unwound from the bobbins. So that the bobbins can unwind freely, they are put in a device called a Lazy Kate, or sometimes simply kate. The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins. The bobbin sits on the metal rod. Other lazy kates are built with devices that create an adjustable amount of tension, so that if the yarn is jerked, {{a whole bunch of}} yarn is not wound off, then wound up again in the opposite direction. Some spinning wheels come with a built-in lazy kate.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "hyphenated American" [...] was {{published}} by 1889, and was common as a derogatory term by 1904.

5000|$|When {{operated}} by a skilled and attentive weaver, looms are not dangerous by themselves. However, {{there are a number}} of inherent dangers in the machines, to which inattentive or poorly trained weavers can fall victim. The most obvious is the moving reed, the frames which hold the heddles and the [...] "pinch" [...] or [...] "sand" [...] roll utilized to keep the cloth tight as it passes over the front of the machine and onto the doff roll. The most common injury in weaving is pinched fingers from distracted or bored workers, though this is not the only such injury found. There are numerous accounts of weavers with long hair getting it tangled in the warp itself and having their scalp pulled away from the skull, or large chunks of hair pulled off. As a result of this, it has become industry standard for companies to require weavers to either keep hair up and tied, or to keep their hair short so as not to allow it <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled.</b> Also, due to possible pinch points on the front of machines, loose, baggy clothing is prohibited. One complication for weavers, in the terms of safety, is the loud nature in which weave mills operate. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to hear a person calling for help when entangled, and has led OSHA to outline specific guidelines for companies to mitigate the chance of such circumstances from happening. However, even with such guidelines in place, injuries in textile production, due to the machines themselves, are still commonplace.|$|E

In 1928 it was enlarged by two additional purchases of 2240 m² and 800 m², and subsequently began to focus upon the flora of the Erzgebirge, but fell into disuse during World War II. At war's end, of the 1026 plants species recorded in the 1930s, only 33 trees and 158 shrubs could be identified. In 1949 it was expropriated and restored with great industry by teacher and botanist Fritz Stopp, and by 1951 cultivated more than 1000 species, gradually growing to approximately 2000 species with good collections of mushrooms, lichens, and mosses. East German state funding was eliminated in 1991, with garden rehabilitation continuing through the 1990s in the reunited Germany.|$|R

40|$|At {{several million}} degrees, the solar corona {{is more than}} two orders of {{magnitude}} hotter than the underlying solar surface. The reason for these extreme conditions has been a puzzle for decades and {{is considered one of}} the fundamental problems in astrophysics. Much of the coronal plasma is organized by the magnetic field into arch-like structures called loops. Recent observational and theoretical advances have led to great progress in understanding the nature of these loops. In particular, we now believe they are bundles of unresolved magnetic strands that are heated by storms of impulsive energy bursts called nanoflares. Turbulent convection at the solar surface shuffles the footpoints of the strands and causes them <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled.</b> A nanoflare occurs when the magnetic stresses reach a critical threshold, probably by way of a mechanism called the secondary instability. I will describe our current state of knowledge concerning the corona, its loops, and how they are heated...|$|E
40|$|For orchestra. Duration: 15 minutes. "Knotted Tongues forms a {{link in the}} {{continuation}} of a latent cycle of my works that contemplates {{the idea of the}} ‘unreliable machine’, itself based on the theory of the 'beast-machine' by René Descartes (1637) which expounds the idea that the body {{is no more than a}} wonderfully complex machine. Most bodies are likely to malfunction, fracture and decay through some self-initiated internal change or mutation, and are, therefore, unreliable. / Taking this idea into the musical domain, the formal shape of the work progresses via musical 'states' or blocks that rupture, rather than by organic, motivically-related development. The debris of exhausted states form or allow a subsequent state to arise. Assonance is preferred to repetition of material. Foreground material competes with dense note saturations only <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>tangled</b> and ensnared.
