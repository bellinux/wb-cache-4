The new film would not be a direct sequel <b>to</b> <b>Salvation,</b> but rather an animated reboot of the original series. It would have been entitled Terminator 3000 and would be shot by Hannover House. However, Pacificor, the owner of the rights to the Terminator franchise, had not given any official license to Hannover House to develop a new film.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path <b>to</b> <b>salvation,</b> and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent <b>to</b> <b>salvation</b> and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E
2500|$|The Missouri Synod {{believes}} that justification comes from God [...] "by divine grace alone, through faith alone, {{on account of}} Christ alone." [...] It teaches that Jesus {{is the focus of}} the entire Bible and that faith in him alone is the way <b>to</b> eternal <b>salvation.</b> The synod rejects any attempt <b>to</b> attribute <b>salvation</b> <b>to</b> anything other than Christ's death and resurrection.|$|R

Initially planning to depart for distant lands, a vision of Christ leads him to aid the impoverished. Freed from the Devil, he becomes a minister and marries Edna.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him <b>to</b> <b>salvation</b> or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential <b>to</b> <b>salvation.</b> Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E

5|$|Pushkar Lake and its precincts {{become very}} heavily {{populated}} during the annual Pushkar Fair or Pushkar mela, which has both a religious {{as well as}} an economic aspect. During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October–November), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one <b>to</b> <b>salvation.</b> It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair. The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels. In this fair held {{on the banks of the}} lake, camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake. Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes. The fair on Kartik Poornima, the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake. It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan. The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances, music, camel races and the cattle fair. The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair. This event is held between the Rajasthanis and foreigners; locals invariably win the event.|$|E

25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its soteriology or doctrine of salvation.
