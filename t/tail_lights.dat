5|$|M34 Prime Mover – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had <b>tail</b> <b>lights,</b> electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} performance VE range sold by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) is marketed as the E Series and it comprised the variants listed below. For the first time, {{in order to}} more greatly differentiate its products from the mainstream donor cars, HSV invested in revised sheetmetal (chiefly, different front fender panels with dedicated air vent and different <b>tail</b> <b>lights).</b> E Series HSV vehicles {{have been the most}} successful and mass-produced vehicles in HSV's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 {{there was}} a minor change of the rear <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> to a {{multi-function}} <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> and brake light.|$|R

5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

25|$|The GTO {{underwent}} a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> were replaced with eight <b>tail</b> <b>lights,</b> four on each side. Rally II wheels with colored lug nuts were {{also available in}} 1967. The GTO emblems located on the rear part of the fenders were moved to the chrome rocker panels. Also the grill was changed from a purely split grill, to one that shared some chrome.|$|E

50|$|The Axiom is {{available}} with a Torque on demand four-wheel drive system, and a direct-injection 6VE1-DI V6 engine and Aisin Warner AW30-40LS automatic transmission was added in 2004, boosting power from 230 to 250 hp (172 to 186 kW). A new chrome bar grille and new liftgate chrome that stretched <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> to <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> was also added.|$|R

50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> of the B2 {{features}} a reflector {{on each side}} of the rear lens. The internals of the lens are also different between the two models. The <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> lens feature identical mounting, so they can be interchanged. The B1 was only released in 1981 and the B2 in 1982, after that, the dual shock 1100 models ended and the monoshock GPz1100(ZX1100-A1) were released.|$|R

25|$|In August 1967 the S50-3 was introduced. The <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> {{and front}} side {{indicators}} were {{changed to a}} rectangular shape, but otherwise the car remained identical to the S50-2 series. The S50-3 was the last Prince model to use the G-1 engine.|$|E
25|$|Over {{half of the}} 16 {{right-hand}} drive cars had these modifications carried out. In recent years several owners of these cars have replaced the Rubbolite lights with original federal style <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> {{in an effort to}} return the cars to their original specification. Some owners have also fitted federal style license plate bezels on their cars.|$|E
25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{included}} new CV carbs, {{a clutch}} upgrade, modified fork internals, new switchgear, <b>tail</b> <b>light,</b> and different rear shocks.|$|R

25|$|Externally, the S50-1 was {{installed}} with rounded brake lights and integrated <b>tail</b> <b>lights,</b> with a centrally installed turn signal, similar in appearance to the Ford Galaxie of 1960. The significant appearance {{change from the}} previous generation seems to reflect a similar approach done by German company BMW in 1962, in deciding to build a small, affordable, performance coupe and sedan.|$|E
25|$|Some analysts noted odd {{features}} of the supposedly track-only H2R model. Although it is outfitted with racing slicks and lacks many features required on a street-legal vehicle in most jurisdictions, such as headlights, rear view mirrors, and turn signals visible from the front or sides, it also has features that are unusual or absent on pure track bikes, such as an ignition lock and LED <b>tail</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was {{designed}} by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired {{by the look of}} that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.|$|E
50|$|Normally {{this is done}} by visual {{observation}} of the signalman, although occasionally verbal confirmation, a tail lamp camera or <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> plunger {{can be used to}} verify the train passed the clearing point complete. This is usually done when the train would stop {{for a long time before}} passing the signal box, e.g., in a loop or station. Another train cannot be accepted from the box in rear until some form of <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> confirmation has been received.|$|R

5000|$|In {{comparison}} to the junior models in the Buick lineup, the Limited was slightly more restrained. Each Limited traded its chromed side panel trim for a body color-keyed insert decorated with fifteen slanted hash marks (three groups of five). The Limited also received its own rear tail treatment that traded the heavy chrome <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> housings for a wraparound <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> lens broken up by four chrome bands. Rear bumper [...] "Dagmars" [...] housed [...] "Dual Jet" [...] back-up lights. Power brakes were standard.|$|R
