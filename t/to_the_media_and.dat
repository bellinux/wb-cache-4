On February 3, 2008, Kalomoira and Kostas Martakis' songs for the national final were leaked via the internet, three days before ERT set release date before a press conference on February 6, 2008. At the February 6 press conference at the Athens Hilton Hotel, ERT officially revealed the songs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> public as well as more details about the national final.

5|$|The prisoners' leaders {{made three}} demands: {{a meeting with}} Attorney General Joseph Berinson, access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> <b>and</b> a {{guarantee}} of no retribution afterwards. The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met. Prisoners did, however, {{have an opportunity to}} communicate with the press during the siege, as the riot was a live media event with television helicopters filming from overhead.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa officially joined Marseille on 1 July 2008 for €12million, {{with future}} {{incentives}} {{to be included}} later, after an agreement was reached between Marseille and Lyon in a meeting organized by the Ligue de Football Professionnel. As {{a result of the}} disagreement over the transfer, in December 2008, Ben Arfa told the local Lyon newspaper Le Progrès that his former team lacked class and was not a great team. Ben Arfa was presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> had his first training session with the club the same day. He was given the number 20 shirt. On 16 July, Ben Arfa was involved in another training session bust-up, this time with striker and France international Djibril Cissé. Cissé later joined English club Sunderland on loan.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> {{held a press conference}} in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E
5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E

5|$|In 2072, {{after the}} Citadel Station's demise, TriOptimum's {{attempts}} {{to cover up}} the incident were exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; the ruthless malevolent A.I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a UN successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>and</b> alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers {{would have been difficult}} {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> <b>and</b> the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E
