5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists {{in the test}} group were instructed {{to adhere to the}} Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the group input and group process factors {{that lead to}} high-quality products in open content communities. A theoretical model was developed, based on the Input-Process-Output approach of group research in social psychology and on the Time, Interaction, and Performance Theory proposed by McGrath (1991). The model tests the relationship between input variables: organizational (Organizational Support), group-related (Group Size, Shared Experience and Group Heterogeneity) and individual (Member Competency and Member Activeness); process variables: group production, group well-being and member support: and an output variable: group effectiveness. A quantitative study of the detailed activity logs of Wikipedia, an open content encyclopedia, was designed using a sample of 10, 000 group tasks. A partial least squared (PLS) statistical approach {{was used to test}} the theoretical model. This study shows the synergistic and overwhelming role played by group size and shared experience on both group process variables and group effectiveness.

25|$|There {{have been}} several notable {{challenges}} to prison corresponding services. The Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) stated that effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using pen pal websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public. Service providers such as WriteAPrisoner.com, together with the ACLU, plan to challenge the ban in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate's rights or a website's right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts, citing First Amendment freedoms. Some faith-based initiatives promote <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> correspondence on inmates, and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance. Inmates' ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts. Inmate correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because of the positive impact it can have on inmates, albeit under the guidelines of each institution and availability of letter writers.|$|E
25|$|On November6, 2013, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} a broad low-pressure area {{over the}} southeastern Arabian Sea.

Moderate wind shear offset <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> upper-level outflow, though high sea surface temperatures aided further development. By November8, organized banding features {{wrapped around the}} northwestern side of a consolidating circulation. Subsequently, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the disturbance as Depression ARB 01 at 1000UTC, making it the first tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea during 2013.

Based on continued development, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert two hours later before declaring the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 2100UTC. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system on a westward course that would bring it over Somalia in two days. Some limited intensification was anticipated, though it was also noted dissipation before landfall was possible.|$|E
25|$|After early {{elections}} in 2003 Balkenende formed his second government with: Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again {{leader of a}} centre-right coalition, Balkenende's policies centred on reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European Elections, beating the general expectation of a huge loss in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26–33% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position {{as leader of the}} CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept this and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende's popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister while 40% preferred Bos. This switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during {{the last year of his}} administration and <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the reformed policy of the Balkenende cabinet, combined with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime-minister.|$|E
