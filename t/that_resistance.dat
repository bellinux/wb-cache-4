5|$|The {{defeat at}} Marathon barely touched the vast {{resources}} of the Persian empire, yet for the Greeks it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} the Greeks had beaten the Persians, proving that the Persians were not invincible, and <b>that</b> <b>resistance,</b> rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the {{invasion}} had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire. Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and <b>that</b> <b>resistance,</b> rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E

30|$|For {{translational}} maneuvers, an approximated force model <b>that</b> considers <b>resistance</b> from terrain deformation {{has been}} introduced. Based on this force model, {{it is assumed}} <b>that</b> the <b>resistances</b> acting on each track are equivalent. Therefore, only the slip ratio and slip angle at the robot’s center of gravity need to be considered.|$|R

5|$|On 15 August 1796 Elphinstone's larger fleet {{discovered}} Lucas's {{force and}} trapped {{it in the}} bay. Aware <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> would be futile and with his crews in open revolt, Lucas surrendered unconditionally. The ships of the captured Batavian force were taken into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron at the Cape; Elphinstone was later made Baron Keith in recognition of his achievements. The Batavian operation did however force the cancellation of a planned British invasion of Île de France. Lucas faced a court martial on {{his return to the}} Netherlands, but died before it concluded by exonerating him for the defeat. The Cape Colony was not attacked again {{before the end of the}} war in 1802, when the Treaty of Amiens returned it to the Batavian Republic.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E
5|$|By 23 November, Pellew's {{squadron}} {{was approaching}} the Sunda Strait {{from the southwest}} when he encountered the British frigate HMS Sir Francis Drake, which he attached to his force. Three days later, the squadron passed the port of Bantam and seized the Dutch East India Company brig Maria Wilhelmina, continuing on to Batavia during the night. At the approaches to the port, the squadron separated, with the frigates and brig passing between Onrust Island and the shore while the ships of the line took a longer route through deeper water. Although Terpsichore was able to surprise and capture the corvette William near Onrust Island, {{the main body of}} the squadron was spotted by Dutch lookouts from a distance, who initially mistook the approaching vessels for a French squadron. The Dutch officers, led by Captain Vander Sande on the frigate Phoenix, decided <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> against such a large British squadron was useless: the only warships remaining in the harbour were the Phoenix and six small armed ships, none of which could contend with the approaching British force. In an effort to dissuade the British from pressing their attack, the Dutch captains all drove their vessels ashore, joined by the 22 merchant vessels that were anchored in the harbour.|$|E
40|$|This chapter asserts <b>that</b> {{conservative}} <b>resistance</b> {{to racial}} change was already entrenched before 1954. It claims that moderate southern politicians were too fearful of an electoral backlash {{to formulate a}} strategy to promote gradual racial reform once the Supreme Court had issued its ruling. It implies <b>that</b> massive <b>resistance</b> only became inevitable because of the timidity and fatalism of liberal leaders...|$|R

5|$|Qutayba ibn Muslim (669–716), Governor of Greater Khorasan {{under the}} Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), {{initiated}} the Muslim conquest of Sogdia {{during the early}} 8th century, with the local ruler of Balkh offering him aid as an Umayyad ally. However, when his successor Al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah governed Khorosan (717–719), many native Sogdians, who had converted to Islam, began to revolt when {{they were no longer}} exempt from paying the tax on non-Muslims, the jizya, because of a new law stating that proof of circumcision and literacy in the Quran was necessary for new converts. With the aid of Turkic peoples, the Sogdians were able to expel the Umayyad Arab garrison from Samarkand and Umayyad attempts to restore power there were rebuffed until the arrival of Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi (fl. 720–735). The Sogdian ruler (i.e. ikhshid) of Samarkand, Gurak, who had previously overthrown the pro-Umayyad Sogdian ruler Tarkhun in 710, decided <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> against al-Harashi's large Arab force was pointless and thereafter persuaded his followers to declare allegiance to the Umayyad governor. Divashtich (r. 706–722), the Sogdian ruler of Panjakent, led his forces to the Zarafshan Range (near modern Zarafshan, Tajikistan), whereas the Sogdians following Karzanj, the ruler of Pai (modern Kattakurgan, Uzbekistan), fled to the Principality of Farghana, where their ruler at-Tar (or Alutar) promised them safety and refuge from the Umayyads. However, at-Tar secretly informed al-Harashi of the Sogdians hiding in Khujand, who were then slaughtered by al-Harashi's forces after their arrival.|$|E
5|$|Robert's Sententiae, or Summa Theologica, {{was well}} known in his time, and has been {{considered}} a key connection in theology between Robert's own teachers' works and the works of Peter Lombard. Robert is the first commentator on St Paul to say <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> to a tyrant might be vindicated by the Bible. Robert also opined that a king might be excommunicated if royal actions harmed the church. Robert used Gratian's works as sources for his own, citing the Decretum Gratiani. Although he used this work, which dealt with church law, he {{does not appear to}} have been considered a lawyer, and his training was that of a theologian. Furthermore, his years as a student predated the establishment of canon law as a distinct discipline in the European schools. Robert's views of the glossators, and their main work Glossa Ordinaria was that they had shortened their glosses to such a point that they made them unintelligible. Robert was also known as a logician, and John of Salisbury named him one of the leading disputatores, or a person who used rhetoric and logic to debate in public.|$|E
25|$|Wingate {{was killed}} in an {{aircraft}} accident late in the war. A continuing controversy over the Chindits has centred around the casualty rate the force suffered, especially from disease. Wingate believed <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> to infection could be improved by inculcating a tough mental attitude, but medical officers considered his methods unsuited to a tropical environment.|$|E

25|$|Erickson is {{most famous}} as a hypnotherapist, but his {{extensive}} research into and experience with hypnosis {{led him to}} develop an effective therapeutic technique. Many of these techniques are not explicitly hypnotic, but they are extensions of hypnotic strategies and language patterns. Erickson recognised <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> to trance resembles resistance to change, and developed his therapeutic approach with that awareness.|$|E
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{the flux}} is {{proportional}} to uv (where v is the velocity of the particles and u that of gross matter) and gravity {{is proportional to}} v2, so the ratio resistance/gravity can be made arbitrarily small by increasing v. Therefore, he suggested that the ultramundane corpuscles might move {{at the speed of}} light, but after further consideration he adjusted this to 105 times the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{polymorphism}} of serum transferrins in reindeer is used {{in population}} and genetic studies. Gene concentrations of alleles in populations of reindeer of the North-East of Siberia were compared with those in reindeer inhabiting Norway, the northern regions of the European part of the USSR and from North American caribou. Researchers found that frequencies of Tf alleles of the Siberian reindeer differed from all the others. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> to necrobacteriosis is related to concentrations of alleles in certain reindeer populations.|$|E

30|$|It {{can be seen}} <b>that</b> the <b>resistance</b> remains {{virtually}} unchangeable (Fig.  3 a) during compression at a {{speed of}} 8  μm/min due {{to the effect of}} X-irradiation. The graphs of dependences of samples exposed to 260 and 480  Gy had a similar appearance. It was shown in previous studies [11] <b>that</b> the <b>resistance</b> was increasing proportionally to the square root of the absorbed dose during the irradiation process.|$|R
25|$|With their supply routes interdicted by an {{increasingly}} effective Russian blockade, ammunition running low and their losses mounting, the Chechen rebel leadership decided <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> was futile. At {{a meeting in}} a bunker in central Grozny the rebel commanders decided on a desperate gamble {{to break through the}} three layers of Russian forces and into the mountains. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had been evacuated earlier to a secret headquarters somewhere in the south of Chechnya. About 1,000–1,500 fighters under field commander Ruslan Gelayev withdrew without orders, leaving other rebel forces exposed.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{they moved}} to the {{neighboring}} island of Gozo, where they bombarded the citadel for several days. The Knights' governor there, Galatian de Sesse, realizing <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> was futile, surrendered the citadel, and the corsairs sacked the town. Taking virtually {{the entire population of}} Gozo (approximately 5,000 people) into captivity, Turgut and Sinan set sail from the port of Mġarr ix-Xini in Gozo and headed towards Libya, where they shipped the captives to Tarhuna Wa Msalata. They later sailed towards Tripoli with the aim of conquering the strategic port city and its environs.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, in August, King Ferdinand I {{opted to}} declare war on the Central Powers. After briefly going on the {{offensive}} the Romanian Land Forces {{had to deal with}} a counterattack, eventually leading to the occupation of Craiova. According to Mariu, the family's book collection was ransacked by the Germans. For a while, Caton took refuge at Valea Mare, in Muscel County, where he reunited with his brother Mariu and many others who believed <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> would be organized there. When this failed to happen, they both sought a safer haven at Câmpulung.|$|E

25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} and occupation of Poland in 1939, a large resistance network was formed. <b>That</b> <b>resistance</b> required funds to operate, {{and the resources}} of the Polish government in exile, delivered through the cichociemni commando-couriers, were limited. In 1942 the resistance began planning to acquire money from the occupiers by carrying out large-scale robberies. Having learned that a large quantity of money would be moved by the occupiers to the German-established Bank of Issue in Poland, the resistance recruited a number of sympathizers within the bank. Preparations lasted about 14 months.|$|E
25|$|Littlejohn {{was killed}} after an hour's combat, and the {{inability}} of the British ship to manoeuvre, the arrival of a second frigate, and the looming presence of the larger French detachment in pursuit convinced the surviving British officers <b>that</b> <b>resistance</b> was futile. Berwick was surrendered and taken first to Gourjean Bay and later to Toulon. The ship served with the French Navy for ten years, before being recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar. Martin's fleet was intercepted by Hotham's a few days later in the Gulf of Genoa, and at the ensuing battle two French ships were lost.|$|E
