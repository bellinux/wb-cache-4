5|$|Part II {{begins with}} <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> singing a recitative and a da capo aria {{in a minor}} mode, {{characterized}} by its extensive use of dotted rhythms. A dialogue recitative for bass and soprano leads to a duet aria with oboes and continuo. After a declamatory bass recitative, the work ends with another four-part chorale setting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} of <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Adolphe Nourrit in Paris in 1839, Chopin made a rare {{appearance}} at the organ, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert's lied Die Gestirne (D. 444). On 26 July 1840 Chopin and Sand were present at the dress rehearsal of Berlioz's Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.|$|E
5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions {{to be heard over the}} choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E

5|$|Mozart's Requiem was sung {{at the funeral}}; the soloists {{were the}} soprano Jeanne-Anaïs Castellan, the {{mezzo-soprano}} Pauline Viardot, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No.4 in E minor and No.6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was Louis Lefébure-Wély. The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the viola da gamba (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> arias.|$|E
5|$|Britten's {{other works}} range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and {{instrumental}} {{as well as}} film music. He took {{a great interest in}} writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.|$|E

5|$|By early July 1724 Bach {{was more}} than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is the text of the first movement. The canticle's doxology is the text of the last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by <b>the</b> <b>tenor.</b> The text of the arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. The text of the duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.|$|E
5|$|Duke Vincenzo was keen to {{establish}} his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the maestro di capella at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister the singer Madama Europa, and <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Steuart Wilson and his wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious shyness with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted {{for the rest of his}} life. The enmity it provoked in Wilson had repercussions in Boult's later career. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career but not Boult's: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of George VI in 1937.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Paoli {{received}} La Cruz de Alfonso II from Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, and {{was declared}} ’’Honor Singer of the Vatican’’ by Pope Pius X. In 1910, he was honored {{with the title}} of Hijo Predilecto de España (Favorite Son of Spain), while in 1911, Wilhelm II, Kaiser of Germany, declared Paoli ’’Kammer Sanger of the Empire’’, and in 1912, Paoli received a protocol-breaking standing ovation from the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph when Paoli sang Lohengrin in Vienna. In 1920, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> was knighted by Vittorio Emmanuelle III, King of Italy, making him Cavaliere De La Corona Italiana and Commendatore Dell Popolo Romano (Knight of the Italian Crown and Commandant of the Roman People).|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Lutosławski {{fulfilled}} {{a commission}} for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux for chorus and orchestra. It {{was the first}} work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle Paroles tissées. This shortened title was suggested by the poet , who had published the poems as Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi. The song cycle is dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Kurt Atterberg's Stormen premiered in 1948 and Frank Martin's Der Sturm in 1955. Michael Tippett's 1971 opera The Knot Garden {{contains}} various {{allusions to}} The Tempest. In Act 3, a psychoanalyst, Mangus, {{pretends to be}} Prospero and uses situations from Shakespeare's play in his therapy sessions. John Eaton, in 1985, produced a fusion of live jazz with pre-recorded electronic music, with a libretto by Andrew Porter. Michael Nyman's 1991 opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs was first performed as an opera-ballet by Karine Saporta. This opera is unique in that the three vocalists, a soprano, contralto, and tenor, are voices rather than individual characters, with <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> just as likely as the soprano to sing Miranda, or all three sing as one character.|$|E

5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is written}} {{for a large}} cast—thirty roles {{including}} small choruses of heavenly beings, sirens and Phaecians—but these parts can be organised among fourteen singers (three sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, one alto, six tenors and two basses) by appropriate doubling of roles. This approximates to the normal forces employed in Venetian opera. In the score, the role of Eumete changes midway through Act II from tenor to soprano castrato, suggesting that the surviving manuscript may have been created {{from more than one}} source. In modern performances the latter part of Eumete's role is usually transposed to a lower range, to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> voice throughout.|$|E
5|$|Walton {{revised the}} score of Troilus and Cressida, and the opera was staged at Covent Garden in 1976. Once again it {{was plagued by}} misfortune while in preparation. Walton was in poor health; Previn, who was to conduct, also fell ill; and <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> chosen for Troilus pulled out. As in 1954, the critics were {{generally}} tepid. Some of Walton's final artistic endeavours were {{in collaboration with the}} film-maker Tony Palmer. Walton took part in Palmer's profile of him, At the Haunted End of the Day, in 1981, and in 1982 Walton and his wife played the cameo roles of King Frederick Augustus and Queen Maria of Saxony in Palmer's nine-hour film Wagner.|$|E
