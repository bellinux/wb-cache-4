40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more {{automobile}} producers adopted the supermarket-concept to enable a flexible and reliable Just-in-Time (JIT) part supply of their mixed-model assembly lines. Within this concept, a supermarket is a decentralized in-house logistics area where parts are intermediately stored and then loaded on small <b>tow</b> <b>trains.</b> These <b>tow</b> <b>trains</b> travel across the shop floor on specific routes to make frequent small-lot deliveries which are needed by the stations of the line. To enable a reliable part supply {{in line with the}} JIT-principle, the interdependent problems of routing, that is, partitioning stations to be supplied among <b>tow</b> <b>trains,</b> and scheduling, i. e., deciding on the start times of each tow train's tours through its assigned stations, need to be solved. This paper introduces an exact solution procedure which solves both problems simultaneously in polynomial runtime. Additionally, management implications regarding the trade-off between number and capacity of <b>tow</b> <b>trains</b> and in-process inventory near the line are nvestigated within a comprehensive computational study.

40|$|In today's mixed-model {{assembly}} production, {{there are}} two recent trends in particular, namely increasing vertical integration {{and the proliferation of}} product variety, which more and more shift focus to an efficient just-in-time part supply.

40|$|National audienceThis paper focusses on {{the problem}} of {{supplying}} the workstations of assembly lines with components during the production process. The components are assumed to be packed in pallets (or boxes). The pallets are shipped from a co-called supermarket and delivered to the workstations using <b>tow</b> <b>trains</b> with wagons. For each time period, depending on the production plan, a workstation has its specific component demand expressed as a fraction of pallets. The problem is to define the sequence of workstations that have to be visited by the <b>tow</b> <b>train</b> at each time period, as well as the number of pallets delivered at each stop. For that specific problem, this paper presents a Mixed Integer Linear Program that aims at minimizing the energy consumption of the supplying strategy.

In order to supply components to their mixed model assembly lines, more and more automobile producers are adopting the supermarket-concept.

40|$|In modern-day {{production}} systems, ever-rising product variety poses a {{great challenge}} for the internal logistics systems used to feed mixed-model assembly lines with the required parts. As an answer to this challenge many manufacturers especially from automobile industries have identified the supermarket-concept as a promising part feeding strategy to enable flexible small-lot deliveries at low cost. In this context, supermarkets are decentralized inhouse logistics areas in the direct vicinity of the final assembly line, which serve as intermediary stores for parts. Small <b>tow</b> <b>trains</b> are loaded with material in a supermarket and deliver parts Just-in-Time to the stations laying on their fixed route.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{manufacturers}} are adopting the so-called supermarket strategy to supply components to the production system. Supermarkets are decentralized storage areas used as intermediate warehouses for parts required by the production system (typically assembly lines). Such a feeding system is widely used in the automotive industry where assembly stations in multiple mixed-model assembly lines are usually refilled {{by means of a}} systematic part replenishment driven by Kanban systems, adopting small trucking vehicles towing some wagons (<b>tow</b> <b>trains).</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a simple but robust framework in order to design the supermarket/feeding system dedicated to complex multiple mixed-model assembly lines. This framework proposes an integrated approach both for long-term (static analytical model) and short-term (dynamic simulation) problems dealing with Kanban and Supermarket systems dedicated to assembly lines, and the <b>tow</b> <b>train</b> fleet sizing and management. This proposed methodology is applied to a case study derived from the Italian automotive industry, and the results highlight the high interrelation between the long and the short term variables that can be evaluated only by an integrated approach that considers both static and dynamic aspects of the problem. The results of this study are then presented and widely discussed...|$|R

Nine collegiate sprinters ran two 20 -m maximal sprints (MSs) and towed sprints (TSs) that were recorded on high-speed video (180 Hz). Sagittal plane kinematics of a 4 -seg-ment model of {{the right side of}} the body were digitized for a complete stride at the 15 -m point for the fastest trial. Sig-nificant (p, 0. 001) differences were observed for horizontal velocity of the center of mass (CoM), stride length (SL), and horizontal distance from the CoM of the foot to the CoM of the body. There was no significant difference in stride rate between the MS and TS conditions. Omega-squared analysis showed that elastic-cord towing accounted for most of the variance in acute changes in horizontal velocity (73 %), SL (68 %), and horizontal position of the CoM at foot contact (64 %). Elastic-cord <b>tow</b> <b>training</b> resulted in significant acute changes in sprint kinematics in the acceleration phase of an MS that do not appear to be sprint specific.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} types of waste in any manufacturing facility is material handling, especially in the case if {{there are a lot of}} different product models. If these product models are assembled on the same production line with very low setup time, Mixed Model Assembly Lines (MMAL) are used. This environment requires very variable feeding of parts at different stations where the number of parts required by each station in a short period is relatively low compared to the pallet size supplied by traditional transporters such as forklifts (Baudin 2004). Usually areas beside stations are scarce and not enough to hold a lot of inventory. Another strategy in which assembly workers can get parts in small bins very close to them is milk run system in which a group of stations is fed by the same tugger or <b>tow</b> <b>train</b> in the same route where each station gets its demand of parts for a certain period (Droste & Deuse 2011).|$|R
