5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{plan would}} still fail if {{sufficient}} ground {{could not be}} taken quickly in Belgium <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> allies against two fronts. Preventing this from happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southern-most army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to the fire of Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Late {{into the}} {{constriction}} phase, dynamin proteins assemble around the outer plastid-dividing ring, helping provide force <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> chloroplast. Meanwhile, the Z-ring {{and the inner}} plastid-dividing ring break down. During this stage, the many chloroplast DNA plasmids floating around in the stroma are partitioned and distributed to the two forming daughter chloroplasts.|$|E

25|$|Terasawa is {{infatuated}} with the salesgirl of a cigarette shop and buys cigarettes just for her scent despite {{not being a}} smoker. After Terasawa's friend suggests that he squeeze a woman's hand to get her going, he does so to his neighbor and immediately ejaculates. They later find out that she has moved and Terasawa is too slow <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> salesgirl's hand.|$|E
25|$|Next, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring {{is located}} in the inner side of the {{chloroplast}}'s inner membrane, and is formed first. The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across, arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins. In a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merolæ, chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.|$|E
40|$|Degenerate {{parametric}} amplification accompanied by dissipation is analyzed within the canonical operator formalism for quantum dissipative systems named non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics. The vacuum {{of the system}} is subject to both dissipation and breaking of phase symmetry due <b>to</b> <b>squeezing.</b> <b>The</b> annihilation-creation operators for the vacuum are derived and the structure of the vacuum is examined. The effects of dissipation on squeezing and uncertainty relation are estimated...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, who knew how <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> last drop out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition {{with just the right}} run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E
25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E

50|$|This {{is still}} a simple squeeze, but it is termed an {{automatic}} <b>squeeze</b> <b>to</b> distinguish it from a positional <b>squeeze.</b> <b>The</b> fact that declarer's two threats are in different hands means that no matter which defender holds both stoppers, {{at least one of}} the threats lies in the upper hand (the J if West is <b>to</b> be <b>squeezed,</b> <b>the</b> K if East is <b>to</b> be <b>squeezed).</b>|$|R
25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> water out of a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out {{in a matter of}} seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{known as}} food sovereignty views the business practices of multinational corporations {{as a form}} of neocolonialism. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics, and in the process <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> poor off of the more productive lands. Under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.|$|E
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a general multi-emitter system coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum reservoir and derive a master equation for this system based on the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. In this theory, we include the effect of positions of <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> sources which is usually neglected in the previous studies. We apply this theory to a quasi-one-dimensional waveguide case where <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> in one dimension is experimentally achievable. We show that while dipole-dipole interaction induced by ordinary vacuum depends on the emitter separation, the two-photon process due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum depends on {{the positions of the}} emitters with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> sources. <b>The</b> dephasing rate, decay rate and the resonance fluorescence of the waveguide-QED in <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum are controllable by changing the positions of emitters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the stationary maximum entangled NOON state for identical emitters can be reached with arbitrary initial state when the center-of-mass position of the emitters satisfies certain condition...|$|R

500|$|Journalists {{employed}} many superlatives {{to describe}} the Kippax style.

His favourite hook shot propelled the ball [...] "with such unhurried ease that the punishing power of the stroke was revealed only {{in the way the}} ball smacked against the fence."

500|$|The {{existing}} wooden carriages for 11-inch {{guns were}} {{too long to}} fit in New Ironsidess cramped battery. A new iron carriage was built where the gun rode in a cradle that slid on iron rails. The new carriages pivoted at the gun ports to minimize {{the size of the}} ports. Two compressors, or clamps, were fitted <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>the</b> rails and increase friction between the rails and the cradle, but these were not strong enough to handle the recoil force when the gun was fired. Two more compressors were fitted as well as rope [...] to restrain the guns, but neither was entirely satisfactory. The problem was not resolved until December 1862 when strips of ash wood were placed underneath the compressors; the friction of iron on wood was double that of iron on iron and the increased friction solved the problem.|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible."

In 1989, the party won {{a seat in the}} Brussels city council, {{as well as in the}} European Parliament. There, the Vlaams Blok agreed to form a parliamentary group together with the French National Front and the German The Republicans, called the Technical Group of the European Right.
