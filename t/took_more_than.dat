5|$|Construction of {{the system}} <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2,000 {{professional}} engineers from 20 countries and over 20,000 foreign and domestic workers six years to complete. Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately.

A fourth group of lots was for track work.|$|E

Recordings of this version <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a month due to Whitfield overdubbing Gaye's vocals {{with that of the}} Andantes' background vocals, mixing in several tracks featuring the Funk Brothers on the rhythm track, and adding the string section from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with an arrangement by Paul Riser.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, {{wielding}} weapons {{such as the}} tomahawk, killed 24 French and <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 70 prisoners. Other sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, {{claim that}} 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the “Massacre.” The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, but since {{they were unable to}} reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped and killed the Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack.|$|E

5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage. In Majahual, the only town to experience {{the full force of}} the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{performances}} in South Africa, Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007. He played in all 12 matches, seven against Australia and five against Pakistan. Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02, averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics. It was a steady performance; Pathan never <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, it <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 {{years for the}} veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have {{played a key role}} in establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, it <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{one and a}} half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{had more}} {{difficult}} {{times in the}} 2006–07 WNCL season.

She never <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one wicket in any match. Her batting also regressed, making 101 runs at 14.42, more than half coming in a 51 against New South Wales in the last match of the season. This was Ebsary's last season for her native state as she moved to Western Australia for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
