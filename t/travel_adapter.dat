50|$|Archos {{employed}} {{a philosophy of}} producing a modular player, making the standard 04 unit base price cheaper with the option of adding on additional features for additional costs. Using the DVR Station or the DVR <b>Travel</b> <b>Adapter,</b> each unit can record from TV and other standard video sources. The DVR Station and DVR <b>Travel</b> <b>Adapter</b> are not included with the units and must be purchased separately.|$|E

50|$|With up to 261 {{hours of}} standby time, the LG Shine offers SMS, EMS, MMS, and Email. Accessories include a <b>travel</b> <b>adapter,</b> strap, stereo {{headphones}} and inline remote/handsfree kit and a USB data kit.|$|E
50|$|The Power series offers various USB <b>travel</b> <b>adapters,</b> car {{chargers}} and batteries.|$|R

50|$|GreenChip Resonant ICs {{such as the}} TEA1713, {{launched}} in early 2010, extend the higher end of the Greenchip portfolio. They feature a resonant converter capable of being applied from 90-600 W and delivering efficiencies of over 95%. They are suitable for {{a broad range of}} applications including LCD TV and high efficiency computing power like high density <b>travel</b> <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Generation 4 {{players were}} modular, with the unit base priced cheaply and {{additional}} features available at extra cost. The add-on DVR Station and DVR <b>Travel</b> <b>Adapter,</b> sold separately, allowed video recording from sources including satellite, cable, and terrestrial television, {{as well as}} DVD players. The players included some working video codecs, but licensing costs meant support for MPEG-2/VOB videos with Dolby 5.1 Sound (AC3) sound and H.264 with AAC sound were not included as standard.|$|E
50|$|Countries {{with ties}} to Europe use 230 volt, 50 cycle power plugs and sockets. While many {{countries}} use the same 230 volt systems, {{there are a variety}} of different connectors used. Difficulty arises when moving an electrical device with a unique plug to another country with a different socket. An electric power adapter sometimes called a travel plug, may enable a plug from one region to use a foreign socket in another region. When traveling to and from continents that use 120 volt 60 cycle power, using a <b>travel</b> <b>adapter</b> is a safety hazard, check on the list of voltage by country.|$|E
50|$|The 604 is the {{flagship}} model, {{and the main}} successor to the AV500. Features include a 30 GB HDD, a 4.3 inch, 16:9 aspect ratio widescreen WQVGA screen, a removable battery, a kickstand, {{and the ability to}} record video and audio from line-in sources (via the optional docking station or <b>travel</b> <b>adapter),</b> or the included microphone. It is thinner than the 504, and about the same thickness as the 404 and 404 camcorder. The screen is glossy unlike the 604 WiFi and the 404, which have semi-matte finishes. The 604 family uses the Texas Instruments DaVinci DM644x processor.|$|E
40|$|During {{the online}} edition of video {{material}} for television over data networks a major con-cern is {{the accumulation of}} delay over the production chain. Before a video signal of a camera arrives at a remote studio to be edited live, it <b>travels</b> over video <b>adapters</b> and analog/digital converters to codecs which in turn compress the signal to comply with small bandwidth constraints. This technical process adds a signicant amount of delay that makes it difcult for the camera crew and director to interact spontaneously. An addi-tional amount of delay is added through their human reaction times as well. Meaningful interaction requires however, that the overall delay times stay within tight limits. The study evaluates the chain of events during the distributed online production of tele-vision shows in the project "Uni-TV " and investigates where delay times can be reduced signicantly during the process. The use of low-latency codecs and cameras that are re-mote controlled over the network is proposed to reduce the interaction times between a camera crew on location and the director at the distant studio. Additional equipment such as analog/digital converters only add very insignicant amounts of delay to the process and are therefore considered xed parameters. 2 Basic Concepts of the Project "Uni-TV" The main focus of the project "Uni-TV " is to produce university lectures online for tele-vision. This distributed production requires high bandwidths to ensure studio quality and low delay times {{to allow for a}} speedy interaction between the camera crew on location and the director at the remote studio. During the production process delay is introduced mainly through the compression and decompression of the video signals to reduce the data vol-ume for transmission. Additional delay is added through the human interactions during the editing process. Whereas so far the camera crew and studio personnel have been separated at distinct locations, it is now being investigated how delay times could be minimized by remotely controlling the cameras from the studio over the data network...|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} of the voltage {{converter}} is for a device that allows appliances made for the mains voltage of one geographical region to operate in an area with different voltage. Such a device may be called a voltage converter, power converter, <b>travel</b> <b>adapter,</b> etc. Most single phase alternating-current electrical outlets in the world supply power at 210-240 V or at 100-120 V. A transformer or autotransformer can be used; (auto)transformers are inherently reversible, so the same transformer {{can be used to}} step the voltage up, or step it down by the same ratio. Lighter and smaller devices can be made using electronic circuitry; reducing the voltage electronically is simpler and cheaper than increasing it. Small, inexpensive, travel adapters suitable for low-power devices such as electric shavers, but not, say, hairdriers, are available; travel adapters usually include plug-end adapters for the different standards used in different countries. A transformer would be used for higher power.|$|E
