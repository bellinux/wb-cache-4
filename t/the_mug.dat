5|$|All four cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer ND Chow. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto <b>the</b> <b>mug,</b> red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E

500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, <b>the</b> <b>mug</b> of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E

2500|$|The perp walk {{has been}} {{described}} as primarily serving the interests of the police and the media rather than the defendant or justice. [...] "Cynics might call the perp walk the crime reporter's red carpet", says crime reporter Art Miller. [...] "Police and prosecutors get to show off their trophy. [...] lap it up because that's all we know we're going to get" [...] since so many other aspects {{of the criminal justice system}} prior to trial take place out of public view, and even trials themselves may not always be televised or even photographed. [...] "Those 30 seconds of a perp walk are the lifeblood to the TV news. Between that and <b>the</b> <b>mug</b> shot that is often all you got as visuals to tell a crime story." [...] Retired NYPD detective Nicholas Casale likens it to a service: [...] "It promotes the arrest, it allows the defendant an opportunity to make a statement to the press, and it's centralized".|$|E

40|$|Contrary to {{theoretical}} expectations, {{measures of}} willingness-to-accept greatly exceed measures of willingness-to-pay. This paper reports several experiments that demonstrate that this "endowment effect" persists even in market settings {{with opportunities to}} learn. Consumption objects (e. g., coffee mugs) are randomly given to half the subjects in an experiment. Markets for <b>the</b> <b>mugs</b> are then conducted. The Coase theorem predicts that about half <b>the</b> <b>mugs</b> will trade, but observed volume is always significantly less. When markets for "induced-value" tokens are conducted, the predicted volume is observed, suggesting that transactions costs cannot explain the undertrading for consumption goods.
