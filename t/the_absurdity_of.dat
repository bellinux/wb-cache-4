5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E

25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou {{thought a}} lot about the human crave for meaning, and about <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> the human condition, rooted in matter but yearning for spirit. He was thinking about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning in and of itself. At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} article, he expounded upon <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> a {{monetary}} {{system in which}} the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.|$|E
50|$|His satirical commentaries {{can read}} like RD Laing in their {{philosophical}} intensity, whilst their subjects {{range from the}} vanities of celebrity and middle-class angst, to highlighting <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> modern life.|$|R
50|$|Like other M*A*S*H episodes, {{this episode}} deals with <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> army bureaucracy: specifically, a supply error {{which results in}} warm-weather clothes being {{delivered}} to the camp {{in the midst of}} winter.|$|R

25|$|Generally {{possessing}} of {{a strong}} sentimental streak, the Argentine public's taste for naïve art, and simple pottery cannot be overlooked. Since Prilidiano Pueyrredón's day, artists in the naïve vein like Cándido López, have captured <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> war, Susana Aguirre, and Aniko Szabó, the idiosyncrasies of everyday neighborhoods, Guillermo Roux's watercolors, a circus atmosphere, and Gato Frías, childhood memories. Illustrator Florencio Molina Campos's tongue-in-cheek depictions of gaucho life have endured as collectors' items.|$|E
25|$|Playwrights {{throughout}} history have looked to Plautus for character, plot, humor, {{and other elements}} of comedy. His influence ranges from similarities in idea to full literal translations woven into plays. The playwright's apparent familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> humanity and both the comedy and tragedy that stem from this absurdity have inspired succeeding playwrights centuries after his death. The most famous of these successors is Shakespeare—Plautus had {{a major influence on}} the Bard's early comedies.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Chinese {{are known}} to have made sacrifices of young men and women to river deities (Hebo), and to have buried slaves alive with their owners upon death as part of a funeral service. This was {{especially}} prevalent during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao of Wei demonstrated to the villagers that sacrifice to river deities was actually a ploy by crooked priests to pocket money. In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> human sacrifice.|$|E
5000|$|Described in the New York Times as [...] "a {{cross between}} Dada, David Letterman, John Cage and the Smothers Brothers", The Art Guys present {{a blend of}} performance, {{conceptual}} and visual art that explores <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> contemporary life.|$|R
5000|$|Kulbak wrote poems, fantastical or [...] "mystical" [...] novels, and, {{after moving}} to the Soviet Union, what are {{described}} by one source as [...] "Soviet" [...] satires. His novel The Zelmenyaners depicted with some realism <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> Soviet life.|$|R
6000|$|... 4. It {{was common}} with the Reformers and Puritans, when condemning <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> Aquinas and <b>the</b> schoolmen, to call it 'Dunsish sophistry,' {{from one of the}} chief of these writers named Duns, usually called, from the place of his birth, Duns Scotus.--Ed.|$|R
25|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding this final scene, however. For example, in his 1990 {{edition of the}} play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Kurt Schlueter suggests that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to Proteus, but the audience {{is not supposed to}} take it literally; the incident is farcical, and should be interpreted as such. Schlueter argues that the play provides possible evidence it was written to be performed and viewed primarily by a young audience, and as such, to be staged at university theatres, as opposed to public playhouses. Such an audience would be more predisposed to accepting the farcical nature of the scene, and more likely to find humorous <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> Valentine's gift. As such, in Schlueter's theory, the scene does represent what it appears to represent; Valentine does give Silvia to her would-be rapist, but it is done purely for comic effect.|$|E
25|$|As enemy aliens, Frisch and Peierls were {{initially}} {{excluded from the}} Maud Committee, but <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> this was soon recognised, and they were made members of its Technical Subcommittee. This {{did not mean that}} they were cleared for radar work. When Oliphant made the services of his secretary available for typing up the Peierl's and Frisch's papers for the Maud Committee in September 1940, they were not allowed to enter the Nuffield Building where she worked, so Peierls submitted them for typing by dictaphone on wax cylinders. Frisch and Peierls thought at first that uranium enrichment was best achieved though thermal diffusion, but as the difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion, bringing in a fellow refugee from Germany, Franz Simon, as an expert on the subject. Peierls also recruited yet another refugee from Germany, Klaus Fuchs, as his assistant in May 1941.|$|E
25|$|The greasepaint {{mustache}} and eyebrows originated spontaneously {{prior to a}} vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. <b>The</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his {{mustache and}} eyebrows.|$|E

50|$|Roser {{has made}} a major {{contribution}} working with marionettes. He first came to public attention in 1951 with his marionette, Clown Gustaf. Another of his characters, Grandmother, is outwardly charming but savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects <b>of</b> society and <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|R
25|$|In Yayoi Kusama’s Walking Piece (1966), a {{performance}} that was documented {{in a series}} of eighteen color slides, Kusama walks along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono with a parasol. The kimono suggests traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, is made to look inauthentic as it is really a black umbrella painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walks down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turns and cries without reason, and eventually walks away and vanishes from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involves the stereotypes that Asian American women continue to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation alters the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama is able to point out the stereotype in which her white American audience categorizes her, by showing <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> culturally categorizing people in the world’s largest melting pot.|$|E
25|$|According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon, it was {{the king}} that first sued for peace with the rebel brothers. Despite his success in retaking Donwun, he was still {{concerned}} about a potential interference by Lan Na. (The marriage alliance between the two states was at a breaking point. His daughter Tala Mi Thiri was never happy at Chiang Mai, and had been asking her father {{to bring her back}} for several years.) The brothers too were interested in an agreement that would preserve their status. The two sides then agreed to a treaty that called for U to recognize the brothers as the rightful viceroys of Martaban and Bassein (Irrawaddy delta) provinces, and to pay them 10 viss (16.33 kg) of gold and ten elephants in exchange for the brothers' recognition of U as their sovereign as well as brokering of an agreement with Lan Na to maintain peace. As the Razadarit Ayedawbon recounts, U realized <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> the overlord paying tribute to the vassals but he ultimately decided to swallow his pride, and agreed to the terms. On the other hand, Byattaba and Laukpya realized that they needed Lan Na's support in order to neutralize Pegu's stronger position. The brothers sent 15 viss (24.49 kg) of gold in total to retain Chiang Mai's support. The king of Lan Na sent back Tala Mi Thiri to Pegu.|$|E
500|$|Also {{among the}} more {{positive}} reviews was Movie Freaks 365s Kyle Bell: [...] "Good ol' Roger gave it his best....

"What {{comes from}} the heart, that alone goes to the heart," [...] says a great writer of our own day;[4] and there are few {{instances}} of this more convincing than the vehemence with which Beattie dissipates the reveries of Berkeley, and refutes <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> Hume.|$|R
50|$|In fact, {{this made}} Dunwich {{by no means}} the {{smallest}} of England's rotten boroughs, but the symbolism of two Members of Parliament representing a constituency that was essentially underwater captured the imagination and made Dunwich one of the most frequently-mentioned examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unreformed system.|$|R
5000|$|According to Alexander Genis, Bakhchanyan [...] "possessed a keen {{sensitivity}} to <b>the</b> <b>absurdities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet regime. By developing and experimenting with inventive artistic strategies, Bakhchanyan broadened {{the range of}} expressive possibilities for other nonconformist artists. Many of his puns became an intrinsic part of Soviet dissident culture." ...|$|R
500|$|Critic M. Keith Booker {{calls the}} final scene an [...] "enigmatic comment on {{representation}} {{and the relationship between}} art and reality". He suggests that the identical images point to <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> art which reflects life directly. The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality, prompting confusion in the viewer; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Cloten, [...] "the conceited, booby lord", is discussed as {{an occasion for}} noting how Shakespeare depicted what is most contradictory in human nature. Cloten, [...] "with all <b>the</b> <b>absurdity</b> <b>of</b> his person and manners, is not without shrewdness in his observations." [...] And again Hazlitt steps back and points out how Shakespeare set one {{character of}}f against the other and presented characters of similar types but with slight modifications of their otherwise similar traits to convey a certain impression about human nature. Hazlitt observes: ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{issue of}} October 25, 2005, eight {{days after the}} premiere episode of the Report, The New York Times ran its third article on The Colbert Report, [...] "Bringing Out <b>the</b> <b>Absurdity</b> <b>of</b> the News". The article {{specifically}} discussed the segment on [...] "truthiness", although the Times misreported the word as [...] "trustiness". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the Times ran a correction. On the next episode of the Report, Colbert took the Times to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that [...] "trustiness" [...] is [...] "not even a word".|$|E
