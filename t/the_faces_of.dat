5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign {{they were to be}} executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5000|$|As for <b>the</b> {{likeness}} <b>of</b> their <b>faces,</b> they four had <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a man, and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a lion, on {{the right}} side: and they four had <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> an ox on the left side; they four also had <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> an eagle. (Ezekiel 1:10, ESV).|$|R
6000|$|... 8. And every cherub had two faces--so here; but I read in Ezekiel 10:14, {{that they}} had four <b>faces</b> apiece. <b>The</b> first was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a cherubim; <b>the</b> second, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a man; <b>the</b> third, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a lion; and <b>the</b> fourth, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> an eagle.|$|R
50|$|To further brand exposure, {{the company}} signs celebrities for ad campaigns. Brenda Song was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Bebe's 2007 ad campaign. The company signed actresses Rebecca Romijn as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Bebe from Spring 2007 through Spring 2008 and Eva Longoria as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> BebeSport from spring 2007 through spring 2009.

5|$|Link: <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Jeckel Brothers debuted and {{peaked at}} #4 on the Billboard 200. In {{order to promote}} the album, Island {{released}} multiple collectible versions of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> Jake or Jack Jeckel. In 2008, it achieved platinum certification.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear {{eventually}} split up, as Meng turned face. The former partners {{faced each}} other at Road Wild 1998; The Barbarian had heel manager Jimmy Hart in his corner. Meng won the match, but The Barbarian, Hugh Morrus and Hart attacked him after the match. Hart later convinced The Barbarian and Meng to reconcile, however, and they wrestled as a tag team again as part of Hart's First Family stable. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear entered a tournament for the WCW World Tag Team Championship in early 1999 after an injury to co-champion Rick Steiner caused the belts to be vacated. According {{to the rules of}} the tournament, teams had to lose two matches before they were eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear won one match in the tournament, defeating the team of David Taylor and Fit Finlay on the January 25 episode of WCW Monday Nitro. However, they were eliminated after losses to the team of Mike Enos and Bobby Duncum, Jr. and the team of Horace Hogan and Brian Adams. In the latter match, The Barbarian attacked Meng, which caused the loss and led to the team splitting up for good.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu {{taught that}} a cherub (as in [...] ) had {{a face like}} a child (keravya), for in Babylonia they called a child ravya. Rav Papa asked Abaye that if this is so, {{then there is a}} {{difficulty}} interpreting , which says of Ezekiel's vision, [...] "the first <b>face</b> was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cherub, and <b>the</b> second <b>face</b> was <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a man, and <b>the</b> third <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a lion, and <b>the</b> fourth <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> an eagle." [...] Would not <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cherub and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a man be the same? The Gemara answered that one was a big <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> other was a small face.|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four Horsemen broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with Horsemen member Chris Benoit. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were booked to face Benoit and Steve McMichael, another member of the Four Horsemen, at Halloween Havoc 1996. Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the Horsemen team. The Barbarian and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order. Hall and Nash's WCW World Tag Team Championship was on the line, but <b>the</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were unable to win the belts, as Nash pinned The Barbarian.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> his characters.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man was {{stern and}} grey--even as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> one musing upon evil things.|$|R

50|$|In apartments, or condominiums, <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> <b>of</b> a unit is {{determined}} by <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire building. If the structure is not an obvious facade, <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit {{is determined}} {{by the side of the}} building having the most Yang energy (<b>faces</b> <b>the</b> busiest crowd flow).|$|R
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|Arts {{commentator}} Melvyn Bragg {{hosted a}} special edition of The South Bank Show about Paige's career in 1996, titled <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Elaine Paige. The episode saw her visiting parts of the world where plays she had starred in had been set: the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, Argentina where Eva Perón had given speeches; the Parisian haunts of Edith Piaf including a meeting with her collaborator Charles Aznavour; and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from previous titles in the Myst series, End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. <b>The</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players {{by the addition of}} multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game's characters as a gift to Myst fans.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or {{the position of a}} tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|The art of mummification {{was also}} practiced by other Chibcha-speaking {{groups in the}} Eastern Ranges; the Guane mummies are well studied, and also the U'wa and farther north the Chitarero of the {{department}} of Norte de Santander mummified their dead. The Carib-speaking Muzo buried their mummies with the head towards the west, while the Zenú and Panche, like the Muisca commonly oriented <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> their mummies to the east. Some of the Muisca mummies were directed towards the south.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{features}} an iconic 150-foot-tall central tower that is visible from many locations throughout the city, courtyards, stained glass, and gargoyles modeled on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the architects. Just {{south of the}} main building is Alumni Field, the school's stadium, which serves as home to the school's football, boys' and girls' lacrosse, and track teams. During a major building renovation in 1978, a modern gymnasium {{was added to the}} southwest corner of the main building. Other athletic facilities include fields for baseball, softball, soccer, and lacrosse, and tennis courts.|$|E
