5|$|Life for the {{ordinary}} {{soldiers of the}} garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered {{for even the most}} trivial offences. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{first noticed}} {{construction}} activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores {{into the old}} quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.|$|E

25|$|A maglev route was {{proposed}} between Sydney and Wollongong. The proposal came to {{prominence in the}} mid-1990s. The Sydney–Wollongong commuter corridor is the largest in Australia, with upwards of 20,000 people commuting each day. Current trains use the Illawarra line, between <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> of the Illawarra escarpment and the Pacific Ocean, with travel times about 2 hours. The proposal would cut travel times to 20 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The first {{military}} {{works at}} Queenscliff commenced in 1860, {{with the construction}} of a sea wall along the top of Shortland's Bluff. Built from sandstone quarried at Point King, this sea wall was positioned directly east of the site of the original upper lighthouse. It was designed to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> and allow the positioning of heavy-calibre guns in an elevated location, right {{on the edge of the}} Bluff.|$|E
25|$|The latest surveys, made in 1989 (Silva and others, 1991), have {{revealed}} new chambers, resulting in further progressive investigations. Beyond the important cave art, paintings and engravings, the underground system has revealed numerous funerary burial sites {{dating from the}} Neolithic to the Chalcolithic, with a universe of interesting artifacts. Outdoors, in an area defined by the extent of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> there were recorded traces of a village that existed throughout the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} of the area are a library, in poor condition, south of the sanctuary, and a relief of the Trimurti to the northwest. There are other carvings further north: a Buddha footprint on <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face,</b> and boulders shaped to resemble elephants and a crocodile. The crocodile stone has acquired some notoriety as being possibly {{the site of an}} annual human sacrifice described in a sixth-century Chinese text; the identification is lent some plausibility by the similarity of the crocodile's dimensions to those of a human.|$|E

25|$|The type of {{host rock}} is {{important}} as well. Most {{of the large}} sea caves on the Western U.S. coast and Hawaii are in basalt, a strong host rock compared to sedimentary rock. Basaltic caves can penetrate far into cliffs {{where most of the}} surface erodes relatively slowly. In weaker rock, erosion along a weaker zone may not greatly outstrip that of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> However, the world's largest sea cave has formed in the heavily fractured Caversham sandstone (Barth, 2013) changing our understanding of which host rocks can form large sea caves.|$|E
25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> of a {{mountain}} nearby, three colossal statues were carved 4,000 feet apart. One of them was 175 feet (53 m) high standing statue of Buddha, the world's tallest. The ancient statue was carved during the Kushan period in the fifth century. The statues were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001, {{on the grounds that}} they were an affront to Islam, even though they were left intact by Muslim rulers for 1200 years. Limited efforts have been made to rebuild them, with negligible success.|$|E
25|$|Naqsh-e Rustam is the {{necropolis}} of the Achaemenid dynasty (500–330 BC), {{with four}} large tombs cut high into <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face.</b> These have mainly architectural decoration, but the facades include large panels over the doorways, each very similar in content, with {{figures of the}} king being invested by a god, above a zone with rows of smaller figures bearing tribute, with soldiers and officials. The three classes of figures are sharply differentiated in size. The entrance to each tomb is at the centre of each cross, which opens onto a small chamber, where the king lay in a sarcophagus. The horizontal beam {{of each of the}} tomb's facades is believed to be a replica of the entrance of the palace at Persepolis.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{were able}} to gather little from the wreckage, most of which was {{severely}} damaged by the crash and the subsequent flash fire. The only instrument with readable settings which could be salvaged was the fluxgate compass, which was used to confirm the aircraft's heading. Propeller marks on <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>face</b> also confirmed the aircraft's heading and indicated that the aircraft was pitched nose upwards as it tried to climb. The propellers themselves were broken in such a fashion to indicate that they were functioning normally at impact. It was impossible to determine, however, the aircraft's speed {{at the time of}} the crash due to a lack of surviving instruments. Investigators were also able to determine that all of the damage to the plane was incurred during or after the crash; there was no indication of a midair mechanical failure.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} trails {{criss-cross}} Cannon Mountain {{and the surrounding}} region. The Kinsman Ridge Trail begins on the northeast {{side of the mountain}} in Franconia Notch near the base of the Tramway, passes near but not directly over the summit, and leads to the southwest across the Cannon Balls and the Kinsman peaks on to Kinsman Notch at the north base of Mount Moosilauke. The Mittersill-Cannon Trail, seasonally open from spring to fall, climbs to the summit area from the northwest, traversing Mittersill Peak on its climb. Both trails join the Rim Trail near the summit, which in turn climbs to the summit tower in a loop partially overlapped by the KRT. Lonesome Lake, {{on the south side of}} the mountain, is a popular hiking destination and is the location of the Appalachian Mountain Club-maintained Lonesome Lake Hut. The Appalachian Trail passes Lonesome Lake but does not cross the summit of Cannon.
