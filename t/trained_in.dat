5|$|Mass Effect is a single-player action {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name {{are determined by the}} player before the game begins. There are six different character classes for the player to choose from and each of them has different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities. For example, the Soldier class is <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> protecting and healing allies. At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player.
