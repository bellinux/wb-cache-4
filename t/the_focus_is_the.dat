2500|$|Like {{the other}} critics, Vendler recognizes {{the theme of}} time in this sonnet. [...] She expands on this by arguing that the sonnet {{revolves}} around the keyword [...] "live". [...] In quatrain 1, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "outlive". [...] In quatrain 2 it's [...] "living"; in quatrain 3 [...] "oblivious", and the couplet focuses on the word [...] "live" [...] itself. [...] However, this {{raises the question of}} whether the young man actually continues to live bodily or if only his memory remains. [...] There are references to being alive physically with active phrases like [...] "you shall shine in these contents" [...] and [...] "'gainst death and all oblivious enmity / shall you pace forth", and also to living in memory: [...] "the living record of your memory", and [...] "your praise shall…find room…in the eyes of all posterity". [...] Vendler argues that this question is answered by the couplet when it assigns [...] "real" [...] living to the day of the Last Judgment: [...] "So till the judgment that your self arise / you live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first of}} these models {{to appear in the}} {{literature}} is the spotlight model. The term [...] "spotlight" [...] was inspired by the work of William James, who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe. The focus is an area that extracts information from the visual scene with a high-resolution, the geometric center of which being where visual attention is directed. Surrounding <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fringe of attention, which extracts information in a much more crude fashion (i.e., low-resolution). This fringe extends out to a specified area, and the cut-off is called the margin.|$|E

50|$|A {{transparent}} {{sphere of}} any material with refractive index greater than one brings parallel rays {{of light to}} a rough <b>focus</b> (that <b>is,</b> a <b>focus</b> with significant coma). For typical values of <b>the</b> refractive index, this <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> usually very near <b>the</b> surface of the sphere, on the side diametrically opposite to where the rays entered. If <b>the</b> refractive index <b>is</b> greater than 2, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> inside <b>the</b> sphere, so the brightest accessible point is on its surface directly opposite the source of light. However, few materials have that property. For most materials, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> slightly outside <b>the</b> sphere. The closer <b>the</b> refractive index <b>is</b> to 2, <b>the</b> closer <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> to <b>the</b> surface of the sphere, and hence the brighter the spot formed on an object touching the sphere.|$|R

It was also {{through the efforts of}} Upali Thera that the Kandy Esala Perahera came into being. Annually in Kandy there is a celebration which includes a parade in which <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> relic of the tooth of the Buddha. This procession was originally focused on honor to Hindu deities, particularly those incorporated into Sri Lankan Buddhism. Upali Thera believed this to be inappropriate in a Buddhist nation, and his influence led to the king declaring that [...] "Henceforth Gods and men are to follow the Buddha".|$|E
5000|$|Victoria's revitalized Chinatown is {{a popular}} area for {{tourists}} {{as well as for}} the artistic community. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 500-600 block of Fisgard Street, including famously narrow Fan Tan Alley, the old Chinese School and a small selection of historic buildings and Chinese businesses. Many historic buildings have been well preserved in Chinatown and also in the larger area it once occupied along Government Street, Herald Street, Store Street, and Pandora Avenue. The modern Chinatown continues to be a key component of Downtown Victoria with many tourist attractions, hotels, bars, restaurants, theatres, services, and shopping areas nearby. The district was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995. [...] It was considered as potential addition to Canada's Tentative List of nominations to become a World Heritage Site, but has yet to be nominated.|$|E
50|$|Diverging (negative) {{lenses and}} convex mirrors do not focus a {{collimated}} beam to a point. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{point from which}} the light appears to be emanating, after it travels through the lens or reflects from the mirror. A convex parabolic mirror will reflect a beam of collimated light {{to make it appear}} as if it were radiating from the focal point, or conversely, reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam. A convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus, both of which are behind the mirror. A convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point {{in front of the mirror}} as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror. Conversely, it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a Cassegrain telescope.|$|E

50|$|The second {{model is}} called the zoom-lens model and was first {{introduced}} in 1986. This model inherits all properties of the spotlight model (i.e., the focus, the fringe, and the margin), but it has the added property of changing in size. This size-change mechanism {{was inspired by the}} zoom lens one might find on a camera, and any change in size can be described by a trade-off in the efficiency of processing. The zoom-lens of attention can be described in terms of an inverse trade-off between the size of focus and the efficiency of processing: because attentional resources are assumed to be fixed, then it follows that the larger <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> slower processing will be of that region of the visual scene, since this fixed resource will be distributed over a larger area. It is thought that the focus of attention can subtend a minimum of 1° of visual angle, however the maximum size has not yet been determined.|$|E

50|$|New Testament Studies, in essence, {{focuses on}} the {{interpretation}} of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament and related literature. In interpreting these texts, attention is given to the language of the New Testament, as well as the history of the texts that were eventually taken up {{to be part of the}} New Testament canon. Important here is not only the way in which these texts were produced, but also their transmission which led to the different surviving manuscripts we today have of the New Testament. This aspect of New Testament Studies is called textual criticism, in which an effort is made to identify the best texts and the most probable original readings of these texts. New Testament Studies also gives attention to hermeneutics, that is, how interpretation takes place. Here <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> different exegetical approaches and methods that can be used to analyse a text. Also important in New Testament Studies is its socio-historical, political and religious background, as well as the history of earliest Christianity. Finally, the study of the New Testament also focusses on the theology of the New Testament, including its relationship with the Old Testament, and Dogmatics and Christian Ethics as a theological discipline. Members of the Department current focus on {{the interpretation of the}} Synoptic gospels, the Johannine literature, Paul and the General letters. Postgraduate students, however, can be supervised on any topic related to the New Testament. The Department strives to publish relevant research and believes in international collaboration.|$|E
