5|$|As ununennium is <b>the</b> <b>lightest</b> undiscovered element, it {{has been}} the target of {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross-section, it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at that time of year. Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical.

5|$|Lithium has a {{very low}} density (0.534 g/cm3), {{comparable}} with pine wood.

Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only two thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3).

50|$|Before modern strobe lights, lenses {{were used}} to {{concentrate}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from a continuous source.

5|$|The JINR team {{sought to}} use {{berkelium}} because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium {{used in the}} beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; and it is <b>the</b> <b>lightest</b> stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, palladium-110 (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei {{were expected to be}} heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 protons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is <b>the</b> <b>lightest</b> particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lightest</b> {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products.

The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: {{it seems likely that}} the same is true of 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
