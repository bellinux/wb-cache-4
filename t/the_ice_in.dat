5|$|Most of the {{reported}} stations for box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> protected refugia.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> <b>In</b> response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E

After some discussiion about the entertainment busniess Chilcott offered Stane the opportunity to run <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House. Stane responded that he would run <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House as a partner. Chilccott agreed and Stane became co-owner of <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> House <b>in</b> 1961.

5|$|First Light {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of two protagonists, Peter, who lives {{with his mother and}} father in New York but is in Greenland for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an underground colony in Greenland called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> <b>In</b> January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he was healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form.

5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the Russian Superleague, contracted hepatitis A. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> <b>In</b> July 2005, the team announced that head coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} in little more than a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E

5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could finally be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> <b>In</b> both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from professional play, Thompson became {{the head coach}} of the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1940–41 season. He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back onto <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He {{was one of the few}} scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players he was watching.|$|E
