25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige.

40|$|Nanoscale novel {{devices have}} raised the demand for {{nanoscale}} thermal characterization that is critical for evaluating the device performance and durability. Achieving nanoscale spatial resolution and high accuracy in temperature measurement is very challenging due to the limitation of measurement pathways. In this review, we discuss four methodologies currently developed in nanoscale surface imaging and temperature measurement. To overcome the restriction of the conventional methods, the scanning thermal microscopy technique is widely used. From the perspective of measuring target, the optical feature size method can be applied by using either Raman or fluorescence thermometry. The near-field optical method that measures nanoscale temperature by focusing the optical field to a nano-sized region provides a non-contact and nondestructive way for nanoscale <b>thermal</b> <b>probing.</b> Although the resistance thermometry based on nano-sized thermal sensors is possible for nanoscale <b>thermal</b> <b>probing,</b> significant effort is still needed {{to reduce the size}} of the current sensors by using advanced fabrication techniques.

50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>probe</b> {{techniques}} have still not achieved the nanoscale spatial resolution that thermal expansion methods have attained {{though this is}} theoretically possible. For this, a robust <b>thermal</b> <b>probe</b> and a high intensity source is needed. Recently, the first images using a QCL and a <b>thermal</b> <b>probe</b> have been obtained by Reading et al. A good {{signal to noise ratio}} enabled rapid imaging but sub-micron spatial resolution was not clearly demonstrated. Theory predicts improvements in spatial resolution could be achieved by confining data analysis to {{the early part of the}} thermal response to a step change increase in the intensity of the incident radiation. In this way pollution of the measurement from adjacent regions would be avoided, i.e. the measurement window could be confined to a suitable fraction of the time of flight of the thermal wave (using a Fourier analysis of the response could provide a similar outcome by using the high frequency components). This could be achieved by tapping the probe in synchrony with the laser. Similarly, lasers that provide very rapid modulations could further reduce thermal diffusion lengths.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{methods are}} {{promising}} tools for small-scale <b>thermal</b> <b>probing</b> and characterization. A lab-developed photothermal (PT) technique provides a noncontact method {{to characterize the}} thermal transport along the thickness direction of a multilayered film by analyzing the phase shift of the thermal radiation from the sample’s surface. Aiming to reduce the calibration in the phase shift method, a new amplitude method is developed {{on the basis of}} the amplitude of the thermal radiation signal. The new method successfully performs the thermal measurements for chemical vapor deposited SiC films, thermally oxidized SiO 2 film on silicon substrates, and spider silk films. Furthermore, weak-sensitivity to the thermal contact resistance enables the amplitude method to lower the effect of thermal contact resistance on thermal conductivity determination. The normalized amplitude ratio of a high frequency to a low frequency provides a reliable way to evaluate the effusivity ratio of the film to that of the substrate. For spider silk films, the contribution to the thermal conductivity from -helices and antiparallel -sheets in silk proteins against the temperature has been studied. Raman spectroscopy is better than PT since its scatterings involve not only the structure information of a sample but also physical properties, like temperature and stress. The edge area of a mechanically cleaved Si wafer is studied using Raman spectroscopy. The appearance of nanocrystals there is proved and it accounts for the abnormal increase in Raman intensity when the grain size of nanocrystals varies from 20 to 10 nm. For transient <b>thermal</b> <b>probing</b> and characterization, a time-domain differential Raman technique is developed using a square-wave modulated laser. The varying duty cycle of the modulation signal realizes controlled heating and transient <b>thermal</b> <b>probing</b> based on Raman thermometry and transient electrothermal technique.

50|$|The AFM is {{interfaced}} with {{an infrared}} spectrometer. For work using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the spectrometer {{is equipped with}} a conventional black body infrared source. A particular region of the sample may first be chosen {{on the basis of the}} image obtained using the AFM imaging mode of operation. Then, when material at this location absorbs the electromagnetic radiation, heat is generated, which diffuses, giving rise to a decaying temperature profile. The <b>thermal</b> <b>probe</b> then detects the photothermal response of this region of the sample. The resultant measured temperature fluctuations provide an interferogram that replaces the interferogram obtained by a conventional FTIR setup, e.g., by direct detection of the radiation transmitted by a sample. The temperature profile can be made sharp by modulating the excitation beam. This results in the generation of thermal waves whose diffusion length is inversely proportional to the root of the modulation frequency. An important advantage of the thermal approach is that it permits to obtain depth-sensitive subsurface information from surface measurement, thanks to the dependence of thermal diffusion length on modulation frequency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pioneering}} experiments of Hammiche et al and Anderson {{had limited}} spatial resolution due to thermal diffusion - the spreading of heat {{away from the}} region where the infrared light was absorbed. The thermal diffusion length (the distance the heat spreads) is inversely proportional {{to the root of}} the modulation frequency. Consequently, the spatial resolution achieved by the early AFM-IR approaches was around one micron or more, due to the low modulation frequencies of the incident radiation created by the movement of the mirror in the interferometer. Also, the first thermal probes were Wollaston wire devices that were developed originally for Microthermal analysis (in fact PTMS was originally considered to be one of a family of microthermal techniques). The comparatively large size of these probes also limited spatial resolution. Bozec et al. and Reading et al. used thermal probes with nanoscale dimensions and demonstrated higher spatial resolution. Ye et al [...] described a MEM-type <b>thermal</b> <b>probe</b> giving sub-100 nm spatial resolution, which they used for nanothermal analysis.
