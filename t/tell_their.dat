5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact.

Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
