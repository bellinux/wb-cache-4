500|$|Epworth {{stated that}} the producers' request was for [...] "a {{dramatic}} ballad", so he and Adele tried to [...] "do something that was simultaneously dark and final, like a funeral, and to try {{and turn it into}} something that was not final. A sense of death and rebirth". Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the [...] "musical code" [...] of the songs, [...] "whatever the modal structure or the chord that always seemed to unify those songs" [...] and contributed to the mood and [...] "that kind of '60s jazzy quality". Epworth identified as an uniting factor [...] "a minor ninth as the harmonic code... the Bond songs, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> elaboration to it", and wrote what would become the instrumental part of [...] "Skyfall". He described it as [...] "a bit of a 'Eureka!' moment".|$|E
500|$|Badmotorfinger {{has been}} {{classified}} by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} songwriting on the album [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision." [...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us {{to come out and}} make something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live. Shepherd contributed the song [...] "Somewhere" [...] and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album. Thayil said that Shepherd's contributions helped make the album [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "weirder".|$|E

500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review in Time that the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute". He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her [...] "grand designs" [...] and [...] "configurations of enormous powers" [...] with [...] "passages of aching poignancy". Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>that</b> their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added that even if you do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|E
500|$|... was {{developed}} by Sniper Studios with support {{from members of the}} original Hitmaker Crazy Taxi design team in Japan and released for the PlayStation Portable on August 7, 2007. The game effectively is a port of both Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2 to this system without any changes to the gameplay, but lacking the in-game advertising and the original soundtracks. While the game includes its own soundtrack, the player can use their own music stored on the PSP; as noted by Jeff Hasson of Sniper Studios, [...] "for those hard core fans that must have The Offspring playing, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> option with the Custom Music Player." [...] The player can also record up to a minute of gameplay footage that can then be shared with friends. The game includes a multiplayer feature over the PSP's ad-hoc wireless system, allowing players to vie for fares within the same map, including the ability to steal passengers from another player. Multiplayer games such as time trials or [...] "C-R-A-Z-Y" [...] runs (a variation of the game [...] "Horse") can also be played sharing a common PSP, with each player taking turns within the game.|$|E
500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) {{have the right}} to remain silent as part of their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Remaining silent is optional—they may speak or be silent as they wish. The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners {{to make sure that the}} suspect is aware <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> right prior to questioning, in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right (and would have relied upon it had they been aware). Miranda v. Arizona [...] and related cases contemplate that a suspect might invoke their rights (make clear they wish to rely on them), waive their rights (make clear they do not wish to rely on them), or do neither of these. A number of cases such as the present one, refine Miranda by addressing when and at what point a suspect, who is aware that they {{have the right to}} remain silent, is said to have begun to rely on that right, as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012 by actor/comedian Chris Rock, who is a longtime friend and fan of the band. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (who was represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez. Frusciante did not attend the ceremony. Smith said [...] "We asked him, he said, 'I'm just not really comfortable with that, but good luck and thanks for inviting me.' He's the kind of guy, I think, that once he's finished with something he's just on to the next phase of his life. The Chili Peppers are not really on his radar right now." [...] Despite recording one album with the band, Dave Navarro and Jack Sherman were the only two former recording band members not inducted. Kiedis explained that Navarro, who appeared to be fine with not being included, was better suited for induction as a member of Jane's Addiction, the band he was best known for. Sherman on the other hand was angry about not being included and spoke out about the band's induction blaming the band for not including him or Navarro by saying he was told only original members, current members and those who played on multiple albums were eligible for induction (although this has proven to not be the case with other inductees). [...] "It appeared to be a politically correct way of omitting Dave Navarro and I for whatever reasons <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> are probably the band's and not the Hall's," [...] Sherman also said [...] "It's really painful to see all this celebrating going on and be excluded. I'm not claiming that I've brought anything other to the band... but to have soldiered on under arduous conditions {{to try to make the}} thing work, and I think that's what you do in a job, looking back. And that's been dishonored. I'm being dishonored, and it sucks." [...] During his induction speech, Smith made sure to thank all of the band members, past and present including Sherman, Navarro along D. H. Peligro (whom he accidentally called H.R. Peligro) and Arik Marshall for the contributions they brought to the band. At 32, Klinghoffer was the youngest artist ever to be inducted into the hall of fame passing Stevie Wonder, who was 38 at the time of his induction. The band performed three songs, including [...] "By the Way", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Higher Ground", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in 24 years and Martinez in 26 years. Near the end of the ceremony, the band was joined by George Clinton, Michael Hampton, Slash, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tre Cool, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones for a performance of [...] "Higher Ground".|$|E
