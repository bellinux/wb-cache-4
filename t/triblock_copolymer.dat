The contact angle values were also {{used to evaluate the}} film surface tensions, following two fundamentally different approaches. The low surface energies found for any of the <b>triblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> were attributed to the pronounced hydrophobicity and lipophobicity of the outermost surface caused by the preferential segregation of the fluorinated block regardless of the distinctly different macromolecular architectures of the <b>triblock</b> <b>copolymers...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce {{hazardous}} chemicals, a one-pot two-step process with active bases and inactive salts was developed for the synthesis of high molar mass PEO-block-PCL-block-P(L- or D,L-LA) amphiphilic <b>triblock</b> <b>copolymers.</b> A series of poly(3 -caprolactone) (PCL) /poly(L- or D,L-lactide) (P(L- or D,L-LA)) di- and <b>triblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> have been prepared in bulk from metal-free catalytic systems and starting from either 1 -pyrenemethanol or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) macroinitiator. The controlled generation of such structures was obtained after screening and comparing a wide variety of organic activators. Narrower dispersity characterizing each sample prepared from the PEO macroinitiator were elucidated by theoretical modeling. Finally, the ability of those <b>triblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> to self-associate in water was studied by dynamic light scattering and compared to PEO-b-P(CL-co-LA) copolymers...|$|R
