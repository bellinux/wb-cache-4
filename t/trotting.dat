5|$|The {{stallion}} Dyoll Starlight {{was credited}} with being the foundation sire of the modern breed, and {{was a combination of}} Welsh and Arab breeding. From his line came an influential stallion of the Section B type: Tan-y-Bwlch Berwyn. This stallion was sired by a Barb and out of a mare from the Dyoll Starlight line. Influential stallions on the Section C and D bloodlines include: <b>Trotting</b> Comet, foaled in 1840 {{from a long line of}} <b>trotting</b> horses; True Briton, foaled in 1930, by a <b>trotting</b> sire and out of an Arab mare; Cymro Llwyd, foaled in 1850, by an Arab stallion and out of a <b>trotting</b> mare; and Alonzo the Brave, foaled in 1866, tracing his ancestry through the Hackney breed to the Darley Arabian.|$|E

Construction of the speedway began in 1967 and the first races were in September 1968. The track has been in use since opening and crowds of over 10,000 have been reported.|$|E
5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular export to New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a <b>trotting</b> horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French <b>trotting</b> lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US <b>trotting</b> horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian <b>Trotting</b> Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian <b>Trotting</b> Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and <b>trotting</b> crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian <b>Trotting</b> Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab blood was added by stallions who were {{turned out in}} the Welsh hills. Other breeds have also been added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire Coach Horse. Before the car was developed, the quickest mode of transport in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by <b>trotting</b> them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could complete this feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such <b>trotting</b> tests.|$|E

5|$|The Morgan <b>trotting</b> {{stallion}} Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his <b>trotting</b> ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares {{may have been}} brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that they were able to keep up with a <b>trotting</b> horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E

40|$|Reason for {{performing}} study: During <b>trot,</b> the rider call either {{rise from the}} saddle during every stride or remain seated. Rising <b>trot</b> is used frequently because it is widely assumed that it decreases the loading of the equine back. This has, however, not been demonstrated in an objective study. Objective: To {{determine the effects of}} rising and sitting <b>trot</b> on the movements of the horse. Hypothesis: Sitting <b>trot</b> has more extending effect on the horse's back than rising <b>trot</b> and also results in a higher head and neck position. Methods: Twelve horses and one rider were used. Kinematic data were captured at <b>trot</b> during over ground locomotion under 3 conditions: unloaded, rising <b>trot</b> and sitting <b>trot.</b> Back movements were calculated using a previously described method with a correction for trunk position. Head-neck position was expressed as extension and flexion of 0, C 3 and C 6, and vertical displacement of C 1 and the bit. Results: Sitting <b>trot</b> had an overall extending effect on the back of horses when compared to the unloaded situation. In rising trot: the maximal flexion of the back was similar to the unloaded situation, while the maximal extension was similar to sitting trot; lateral bending of the back was larger than during the unloaded situation and sitting trot; and the horses held their heads lower than in the other conditions. The angle of C 6 was more flexed in rising than in sitting <b>trot.</b> Conclusions and clinical relevance: The back movement during rising <b>trot</b> showed characteristics of both sitting <b>trot</b> and the unloaded condition. As the same maximal extension of the back is reached during rising and sitting <b>trot,</b> {{there is no reason to}} believe that rising <b>trot</b> was less challenging for the back...|$|R

5|$|Several horses {{imported}} to the United States from Canada had {{a lasting}} impact on American horse breeding. In the early 1800s, a roan-coloured stallion named Copperbottom was imported to Lexington, Kentucky from Quebec, through Michigan. He {{began to be}} offered for stud service in 1816, and his progeny spread throughout the eastern US. Known mainly as saddle stock, they also included several pacing horses. Another roan stallion, Tom Hal, a successful pacer in his own right, founded an important family of pacers in the US. Appearing in Kentucky in 1824, he was offered for stud, and his offspring (many of whom carried on the family name, being differentiated only {{by the name of}} the owner) began the family of Standardbreds that included Little Brown Jug, Brown Hal, Star Pointer, Adios and Good Time, all champion harness racing horses. Another pacing import to the US was a black stallion named Old Pilot, said to have been bred near Montreal, who originated the Pilot family of <b>trotting</b> horses. Old Pilot produced a son, also named Pilot, who was acclaimed as a sire of <b>trotting</b> horses, as well as being a successful harness horse himself.|$|E

Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by <b>trotting</b> back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E

A failure as a <b>trotting</b> horse, due to his insistence on pacing, he was instead used for breeding. From his line, a foal named Roan Allen was born in 1904. Able to perform several ambling gaits, Roan Allen became a successful show horse, and in turn sired several famous Tennessee Walking Horses.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a versatile horse, appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred <b>trotting</b> horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du cheval français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du cheval français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as versatile horses that could be used for both riding and driving.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Norman was {{developed}} in the early 19th century, and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood, influences were seen from other breeds, including British and Russian <b>trotting</b> horses. By the mid-19th century, the Anglo-Norman was a popular breed throughout France, and in 1864 a breed association was founded. While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses, there was controversy over whether the Anglo-Norman was the best choice for the military. The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs, although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders and the needs of the military. Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly reduced demand for the breed, and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses. While rebuilding their herds, breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Horse {{descended from}} the French stock Louis XIV sent to Canada in the late 17th century. The initial shipment, in 1665, {{consisted}} of two stallions and twenty mares from the Royal Stables in Normandy and Brittany, the center of French horse breeding. Only 12 of the 20 mares survived the trip. Two more shipments followed, one in 1667 of 14 horses (mostly mares, but {{with at least one}} stallion), and one in 1670 of 11 mares and a stallion. The shipments included a mix of draft horses and light horses, the latter of which included both pacing and <b>trotting</b> horses. The exact origins of all the horses are unknown, although the shipments probably included Bretons, Normans, Arabians, Andalusians and Barbs.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{horse is}} a horse breed from Canada. It is a strong, {{well-muscled}} breed of horse, usually dark in colour. The horses are generally used for riding and driving. Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada {{in the late}} 1600s, it was later crossed with other British and American breeds. During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern US, where it contributed {{to the development of}} several horse breeds. During the peak popularity of the breed, three subtypes could be distinguished, a draft horse type, a <b>trotting</b> type and a pacing type. Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century, many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War. These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population {{almost to the point of}} extinction, prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of a law against further export.|$|E
