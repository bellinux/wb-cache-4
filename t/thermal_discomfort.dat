The useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factors—the percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an illuminance value. The range for these factors is typically 100-2,000 lux. Useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has {{the added benefit of}} addressing glare and <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The upper threshold is used to determine when glare or <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> is occurring and may need resolution.|$|E
50|$|Although {{thermal comfort}} is usually {{discussed}} {{for the body}} as a whole, thermal dissatisfaction may also occur just for a particular part of the body, due to local sources of unwanted heating, cooling or air movement. According to the ASHRAE 55-2010 standard, there are four main causes of <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> to be considered. A section of the standard specifies the requirements for these factors, that apply to a lightly clothed person engaged in near sedentary physical activity. This is because people with higher metabolic rates and/or more clothing insulation are less thermally sensitive, and consequently have less risk of <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Skin {{wettedness}} {{is defined}} as [...] "the proportion of the total skin surface area of the body covered with sweat."The wetness of skin in different areas also affects perceived thermal comfort.

[...] The extremities are much more sensitive to <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> from wetness than the trunk of the body.

30|$|From the {{analysis}} of thermal sensations, {{it can be concluded}} that sequence of exercise intensity during the whole process plays a major part in the subjective thermal sensation. Richard de Dear (2011) suggested a concept of alliesthesia: any external or environmental stimulus that has the precept of restoring the regulated variable within the milieu interieur to its set point will be perceived as pleasant (positive alliesthesia), while any environmental stimulus that will further displace the error between the regulated variable and its set point will be perceived as distinctly unpleasant, or even noxious in more extreme cases (negative alliesthesia). In our research, although the walking distance is the same, Exercise 3 makes the subjects more tolerable to the environment with the velocity decrease from 6 to 3  km/h in the end, and their desire to lower the temperature is less strong than Exercise 2. The decrease of the velocity in Exercise 3 is a pleasant stimuli thus leads to the positive alliesthesia, while the increase of the velocity in Exercise 2 is an unpleasant stimuli so the subjects want to avoid it. The change of exercise intensity is an external stimulus. And it plays the same role in this alliesthesia theory as the environmental stimulus. Luo et al. (2016) once concluded that if personal control approaches were utilized, the <b>thermal</b> <b>discomforts</b> might be reduced through a slightly improvement of thermal condition. The mechanism of the external or environmental stimulus affects the thermal comfort is still under development, so the occurrence and calculation methods of the alliesthesia is still unknown.|$|R
40|$|Session: [CS 04 - 7] Urban climate (3) : no. 2 Urbanization {{is known}} to cause {{significant}} changes in the properties of local climate. Studies have shown that urban areas, compared to rural areas with less artificial lands, registered higher local temperatures as a result of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. Hong Kong {{is one of the most}} densely populated cities in the world with high portion of population residing in urbanized areas, hot/humid weather and densely built high-rise buildings created severe local <b>thermal</b> <b>discomforts.</b> To fully characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of UHI effects in Hong Kong, my study deployed 25 small, durable and low-cost logging sensors at various sites to take temperature/humidity measurements for 17 consecutive days throughout within a typical urban area of Hong Kong. With the aid of GIS and GPS, the measurements were mapped against the urban structures and land use to enable ratings of environmental settings at various sites. The respective meteorological conditions in duration were correlated with the sensors measurements for further evaluations and validations. This empirical study not only established the feasibility of employing the small and inexpensive logging sensors for widespread deployment but also confirmed the existence and the extent of microclimate variations of UHI in Hong Kong. These empirical data formed the bases of spatio-temporal examination of UHI effects in urbanized areas of Hong Kong. The study and the methodology have also paved a sound foundation and provided essential frameworks for further studies of UHI effects on local human comfort and environmental health of Hong Kong. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|The urban heat {{island effect}} {{has a direct}} {{relation}} with thermal comfort.

Especially at night, stress caused by heat exhaustion can impact a wide number of diseases which may become worse, particularly in the elderly and children (Laaidi et al. 2012). Further, thermal stress is most relevant to people who spend a substantial time outdoors during a day. These include pedestrians, cyclists, vendors, shopkeepers near roadside and most people from the lower strata of society who live in makeshift houses which can form a significant proportion of population in developing countries (Mohan et al. 2014). A large section of this population does not have air conditioning facilities and, thus is most affected by <b>thermal</b> stress-induced <b>discomfort</b> during day as well as night.|$|R

40|$|Summary It is {{generally}} {{taken for granted}} that people like sunshine inside buildings, provided <b>thermal</b> and visual <b>discomfort</b> are avoided. Obviously {{the degree to which}} sunshine is liked is dependent on climate, tradition and sometimes on prejudice. It is a common practice in building design to deal with the thermal aspects of sunshine and their control, while visual aspects of sunlight are not adequately considered. Recent studies have indicated {{that as a result of}} the trend towards improved thermal comfort in buildings, the visual aspects of sunlight have assumed a higher degree of importance for the well being of occupants. Further studies have been made of the effect of the presence of sunlight and also of the degree of exposure of occupants to the Sun. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: <b>Thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> often affects {{prosthesis}} wearers {{and could}} be addressed by increasing liner thermal conductivity. This note explores a liner made from thermally conductive silicone and two additional alternative liner designs. Technique: Thermally conductive silicone was {{used to create a}} conductive liner and a hybrid liner. Additionally, one with open elements was made. These were compared with a plain silicone liner and a no liner scenario. Scaled down liner prototypes were used due to the high-cost of the thermally conductive silicone. Temperature decay profiles were collected by attaching thermistors to a heated liner phantom and used to evaluate scenarios. Discussion: No scenario performed much better than the plain silicone liner. Implementation of passive solutions may be easier, but alternative liner materials are unlikely to affect dissipation enough to address <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Based on this work, future research efforts may be better spent developing active <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> solutions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of active pre-warming on speed and quality of performance during simulated firefighting exercise. Twelve male firefighters performed two trials in counterbalanced order. They were either pre-warmed by 20 -min cycling at 1. 5 Watt kg- 1 body mass (WARM) or remained thermoneutral (CON) prior to a simulated firefighting activity. After the pre-warming, gastrointestinal temperature (P < 0. 001), skin temperature (P = 0. 002), and heart rate (P < 0. 001) were higher in WARM than in CON. During the firefighting activity, rating of perceived exertion, <b>thermal</b> sensation and <b>discomfort</b> were higher for WARM than for CON. Finish time of the firefighting activity was similar, but the last task of the activity was completed slower in WARM than in CON (P = 0. 04). In WARM, self-reported performance quality was lower than in CON (P = 0. 04).

40|$|Thermoafferent {{information}} is integrated at multiple levels within {{the central nervous}} system. However, due to the difficulty in differentiating thermoregulatory functions of the spinal cord from those of higher centres in humans, {{the role of the}} spinal cord in certain aspects of thermoregulation remains unclear. Subjects with spinal cord injury have unique neural changes providing an opportunity to evaluate the role of the spinal cord, independently of higher thermoregulatory centres. Subjects with (N= 11) and without (N= 11) spinal cord injury were studied in a series of experiments, in which a wide range of local and whole-body temperature changes and postural manipulations were imposed. During these trials, various physiological (skin temperature, core temperature, local sweat rate and sweat expulsion frequency - a measure of central sympathetic drive), and psychophysical variables (<b>thermal</b> sensation and <b>discomfort)</b> were investigated. Six key observations arose from these experiments: (i) Subjects with spinal cord injury had a lower thermoafferent capacity (secondary to neural damage) and a corresponding reduction in thermoefferent drive (sudomotor sensitivity of 4. 2 versus 8. 8 expulsions•min- 1 •,°C- 1;in able-bodied; P= 0. 03). (ii) Equations used to approximate thermoafferent drive in able-bodied subjects, overestimated thermal feedback in subjects with spinal cord injury. However, this could be corrected by modifying the skin area weightings to include only the sensate areas. (iii) No subjects with physiologically-confirmed thermoefferent spinal cord injury displayed sweating from insensate skin sites, indicating that a spinal cord that has been isolated from higher centres cannot induce thermal sweating. (iv) Subjects with spinal cord injury had higher forehead sweat rates (0. 77 versus 0. 52 mg•cm- 2 •min- 1; P= 0. 03), but an equivalent sweat sensitivity (1. 24 versus 1. 27 mg•cm- 2 •min- 1 •,°C- 1; P= 0. 94), indicating the presence of a peripheral adaptation to sustain thermal homeostasis, and secondary to reduced thermal afferent and efferent flow. (v) Respiratory frequency increased more for a given increase in body temperature in subjects with spinal cord injury (2. 4 versus 1. 1 breaths•min- 1 •°C- 1; P= 0. 042), but this did not provide a thermoregulatory benefit. (vi) Subjects with spinal cord injury demonstrated greater changes in behavioural thermoregulatory indicators (<b>thermal</b> sensation and <b>discomfort)</b> in response to standardised local and whole-body thermal loads. Collectively, these observations indicate the unique nature of thermoregulation in people with spinal cord injury and the adaptive ability of the human thermoregulatory system...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relationship between students’ perceived <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> and stress behaviours affecting their learning in lecture theatres in the humid tropics. Two lecture theatres, LTH- 2 and 3, at the Niger Delta University, Nigeria, {{were used for the}} study. Two groups of students from the Faculties of Agriculture and Engineering and the Department of Technology Education constituted the population. The sample size selected through random sampling for Groups A and B was 210 and 370 students, respectively. Objective and self-report instruments were used for data collection. The objective instrument involved physical measurement of the two lecture theatres and of the indoor temperature, relative humidity and air movement. The self-report instrument was a questionnaire that asked for the students perceived indoor <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> levels and the effect of indoor thermal comfort level on perceived stress behaviours affecting their learning. The objective indoor environmental data indicated <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> with an average temperature of 29 – 32 °C and relative humidity of 78 % exceeding the ASHARE [1] and Olgyay [2]. The students’ experienced a considerable level of <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> and also perceived that stress behaviours due to <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> affected their learning. Further, {{there were no significant differences}} in the perceived <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> levels of the two groups of students in LTH- 2 and 3. Furthermore, stress behaviours affecting learning as perceived by the two groups of students did not differ significantly. In addition, no correlation existed between the perceived indoor <b>thermal</b> <b>discomfort</b> levels and stress behaviour levels affecting learning for students in LTH- 2, because the arousal level of the students in the thermal environment was likely higher than the arousal level for optimal performance [3, 4]. However, a correlation existed in the case of students in LTH- 3, which was expected because it only confirmed the widely-accepted view that stress behaviours exhibited by students in any learning can have a profound effect on learning. It was recommended that teaching-learning indoor environment should be thermally comfortable by providing adequate window openings with proper orientation and also by ensuring that the learning space only accommodated the required student capacity to reduce the stress behaviours that affect learning...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionAthletes are {{permanently}} {{exposed to}} {{or in the}} state of transient thermal conditions, because of their own varying metabolic output or environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind velocity and radiation. This causes <b>thermal</b> stress, <b>discomfort</b> and even inhibits performance. The human body constantly regulates its internal temperature receiving neuronal signals from thermal receptors in the skin. Both warm and cold receptors have static and dynamic responses to thermal transitions in the environment. The latter occurs at sudden thermal changes that lead to peak the receptors firing rate. It is well known how humans thermally perceive transient thermal conditions due to starting temperature, temperature gradient {{and the size of the}} skin surface area. Not known is their comfort response to quick environmental changes. Therefore this study investigates local comfort response of sudden thermal changes, whether they can improve thermal comfort and imply useful applications for hot or cold environments in sports. MethodologyEight healthy, male subjects were exposed to three warm and cold environments in standardized clothing. After 20 minutes of acclimatization nine body parts were locally treated with cool and warm convection to trigger peak receptor responses (“overshoot”). Local skin temperatures were measured and subjects were asked about their thermal comfort and perception. ResultsResults show highly significant global comfort improvement by local overshoot in both environments (p=. 00, α=. 01) at every body part. Furthermore results show tendencies for major impact on comfort of core body parts. ConclusionTo sum up this research found the possibility for temporal local treatment as highly efficient for significant comfort improvement. For instance local heating via technical textiles can improve comfort in harsh skiing conditions or local cooling can do the same in extreme heat. Nonetheless further research is needed to quantify physiological impacts of temporal local treatments for further implications e. g. on sports performance as well as possibilities of technical realizations...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of new office {{buildings}} is characterized by extended external glazed surfaces, generally located without any care about orientation. Without a suitable solar control strategy, this fact implies a series of well-known problems: high-energy demand and consequent carbon dioxide emissions for HVAC, as well as <b>thermal</b> and luminous <b>discomfort.</b> Moreover, if the working room is large, the values of physical parameters influencing comfort are relevantly variable from point to point. The best way to control entering solar radiation {{is based on the}} use of external movable elements, such as slats or screens. However, in some winter periods, it would be appreciated to promote the collection of solar radiation in order to contribute to cover heating loads. In this case, the use of internal diffusing or redirecting elements (i. e., blinds or venetian curtains) is necessary to avoid glare phenomena. The physical properties of these elements influence the room thermal balance, and their temperatures influence indoor thermal comfort conditions, particularly for the nearest occupants.

30|$|Although {{the use of}} {{appropriate}} multilayered textile materials can help to achieve {{a high level of}} thermal protection, the transfer properties of these materials are compromised. The multilayered protective clothing can prevent the air and water vapour transport, which results in increased thermal stress and reduces the work efficiency of the fire-fighters (Havenith [1999]). Failure to achieve a thermal balance will result in heat stress and saturation of the microclimate close to the skin with high humidity and condensation of liquid from the sweat on the skin (Nunneley [1989]). This can lead to high <b>thermal</b> load and <b>discomfort,</b> which in turn restricts the work time of fire-fighters. Hence, the recent designs should not only focus on the protection but also consider to reduce the heat stress (Holmér [1995]). The heat stress can be measured from the heart rate and the core body temperature (Bruce-Low et al. [2007]). The amount of heat stress depends on the ability of the fabric to transfer the heat and moisture vapour from the wearer’s skin to the environment. The parameters affecting these properties are thermal resistance (Rct) and moisture vapour resistance (Ret) (Lotens and Havenith [1991]), which are discussed in subsequent section on comfort.|$|R
