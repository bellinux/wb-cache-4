5|$|The {{character}} of Red Rackham was partly inspired by Jean Rackam, a fictional pirate {{who appeared in}} a story alongside female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read that Hergé encountered in a November 1938 edition of Dimanche-Illustré. Red Rackham's looks and costumes were also inspired by the character, Lerouge, who appears in C. S. Forester's novel, The Captain from Connecticut, and by the 17th-century French buccaneer Daniel Montbars. The name of Marlinspike Hall— in French—was based upon {{the name of the}} real Belgian town, Sart-Moulin. The actual design of the building was based upon the Château de Cheverny, albeit with the two outer wings removed. In introducing Francis Haddock to the story, Hergé made Captain Haddock the only character in the series (except Jolyon Wagg, introduced later) <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> and an ancestry.|$|E

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Rettenmund had a {{different}} interpretation of the video, calling it as a [...] "subtly orchestrated story of the singer's addiction to—and almost spiritual deliverance from—heroin". He found contrast in Madonna's white blonde character—with hyper-glamor, heavy mascara, pierced nose and navel, a clingy blouse and vintage high heels—to the neighborhood of Harlem, where Madonna is portrayed as a [...] "Billie Holiday-esque singer in the jazz club". At {{the end of the}} video, Madonna climbs up the stairs to her lover's room, Rettenmund found references to the music videos for the singles [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984) and [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), both of which had the singer climbing the stairs but never reaching the destination, unlike [...] "Secret". Rettenmund also observed that [...] "Secret" [...] could serve as a follow-up to the music video for [...] "Borderline" [...] with the events happening ten years and Madonna all grownup. He concluded by saying that in lieu of the singer's 1994 interview with The Face magazine, where she expressed her desire <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> the video emphasized on Madonna's interest in a partner and a child.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> She lets go of the helm and stumbles {{to the back of the}} boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E

2500|$|Today, many {{family names}} have ta as a component, a {{practice}} {{which can be}} largely attributed to a government edict in the early Meiji Period which required all citizens <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> name. Many chose a name based on some geographical feature associated with their residence or occupation, and as nearly three fourths of the population were farmers, many made family names using ta. Some common examples are Tanaka (...) , literally meaning [...] "in the paddy field;" [...] Nakata (...) , [...] "middle paddy field;" [...] Kawada (川田), [...] "river paddy field;" [...] and Furuta (...) , [...] "old paddy field." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are differing {{views about}} how {{important}} it is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member or relative who also attended a college. It is clear that it is a factor; one report suggested that having a family member who is an alumnus gives [...] "a leg up" [...] for applicants. One report suggested that siblings do not count as legacies. In some cases, a parent's attendance at a related graduate school counts as a legacy, but most colleges do not count this. Many selective private colleges have a higher admit rate for alumni children as a way to [...] "keep the larger set of alumni happy and giving", and being a legacy applicant can mean as much as [...] "100 or 200 points on the SAT".|$|E

[...] Another aspect of her Go-Set work was record reviews, which were taken up by Nimmervoll, he was [...] "more descriptive, knowledge-based, and historically comparative than Brett's reviews. In the limited column space available, Nimmervoll captured the meaning of the recording and its place in rock music history."

2500|$|Enya {{is known}} for keeping a low profile and very private lifestyle, saying: [...] "The music is what sells. Not me, or what I stand for... that's the way I've always wanted it".

In 1991, she said: [...] "I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think {{a great deal about}} this".

I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up.

2500|$|After Maria's baby is {{declared}} dead, Erica {{finds the}} little girl and tries to return her to Maria. When she gets to Wildwind, she overhears Maria and Dimitri discussing the baby and deciding the baby's death was for the best. Hearing this, Erica decides to pass the baby off as a child she adopts from Russia. Erica names the baby Sonya Kane. Dimitri sees this as another chance <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> with Erica and {{wants to be a}} father to Sonya. Erica refuses to let him be a part of either of their lives. This makes Dimitri so angry he begins checking into Sonya's adoption. Tad Martin and Gloria Marsh are also looking into it. Losing Erica leads Dimitri to do very cruel things such as conning mentally challenged Stuart Chandler out of his television station, WRCW, in an attempt to get back at Erica for leaving him. She has a television show, the Cutting Edge, on that station. He also [...] "kidnaps" [...] and romantically pursues a very taken Gloria Marsh. While in a rage he accidentally hits Erica and baby Sonya with his car. Sonya is taken to the hospital where Maria gives her a check up and feels a connection with her. Eventually, Erica returns Sonya to Maria and is sent to prison for kidnapping. Maria is presumed dead not long afterward, leading to a custody battle between Dimitri and Edmund over the baby, now named Maddie Grey. Dimitri is awarded custody after a few dirty tricks such as drugging Edmund so he will look like an unfit parent. Even after Dimitri finds out he is not Maddie's father, he keeps the secret from his brother. To insure the secret does not get out, Dimitri threatens Skye and beats the lab technician who helped her switch the results. From behind bars, Erica finds out Dimitri is not Maddie's father and helps Edmund reunite with his daughter.|$|E
2500|$|Norman Sanders {{calls the}} play [...] "almost a {{complete}} anthology of {{the practices of}} the doctrine of romantic love which inspired the poetic and prose Romances of the period." [...] At the very centre of this is the contest between love and friendship; [...] "an essential part of the comicality of The Two Gentlemen of Verona is created by the necessary conflict between highly stylised concepts of love and friendship." [...] This is manifested in {{the question of whether the}} relationship between two male friends is more important than that between lovers, encapsulated by Proteus' rhetorical question at 5.4.54; [...] "In love/Who respects friend?" [...] This question [...] "exposes the raw nerve at the heart of the central relationships, the dark reality lurking beneath the wit and lyricism with which the play has in general presented lovers' behaviour." [...] In the program notes for John Barton's 1981 RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Anne Barton, his wife, wrote that the central theme of the play was [...] "how to bring love and friendship into a constructive and mutually enhancing relationship." [...] As William C. Carroll points out, this is a common theme in Renaissance literature, which often celebrates friendship as the more important relationship (because it is pure and unconcerned with sexual attraction), and contends that love and friendship cannot co-exist. As actor Alex Avery argues, [...] "The love between two men is a greater love for some reason. There seems to be a sense that the function of a male/female relationship is purely for the family and to procreate, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> But a love between two men is something that you choose. You have arranged marriages, [...] a friendship between two men is created by the desires and wills of those two men, whereas a relationship between a man and a girl is actually constructed completely peripheral to whatever the feelings of the said boy and girl are." ...|$|E
