500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is one {{of those}} songs that's in the DNA of so much going on <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> it's hard to know where to start. Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully. I also think that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.|$|E
2500|$|Evans never embraced {{new music}} movements; {{he kept his}} style intact. For example, he lamented {{watching}} Davis shift his style towards jazz fusion, and blamed the change on considerations of commerce. Evans commented [...] "I {{would like to hear}} more of the consummate melodic master , but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> <b>that</b> unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music." [...] However, Evans and Davis kept in touch throughout their lives.|$|E

5000|$|Michael Kuchwara, in his Associated Press review, wrote [...] "The Story of My Life is {{a heartfelt}} little musical {{that has the}} courage of its sweet-tempered, low-key convictions. <b>These</b> <b>days,</b> <b>that's</b> a novelty. In a Broadway world of big musicals {{determined}} to sell themselves, this gentle new show celebrates softly but with an emotional pull that slowly wins you over." ...|$|R
5000|$|In JazzTimes Chris Kelsey wrote [...] "Straightahead tenor {{players who}} {{regularly}} stretch themselves and break a sweat {{in the process}} are too {{few and far between}} <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That’s</b> what makes a record by someone like the late Bill Barron so attractive. Barron had no such problems cutting loose. He possessed an original voice-not revolutionary, but unique in its way".|$|R
2500|$|It was in <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> Twain {{became a}} writer of the Sagebrush School; he was known later as the most notable within the genre. His first {{important}} work was [...] "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," [...] published in the New York Saturday Press on November 18, 1865. After a burst of popularity, the Sacramento Union commissioned him to write letters about his travel experiences. The first journey that he took for this job was to ride the steamer Ajax on its maiden voyage to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). All the while, he was writing letters to the newspaper that were meant for publishing, chronicling his experiences with humor. These letters {{proved to be the}} genesis to his work with the San Francisco Alta California newspaper, which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from San Francisco to New York City via the Panama isthmus.|$|E

6000|$|The Admiral {{rubbed his}} hands, and shook with amusement. [...] "We'll {{find one of}} <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> three and two make one," [...] said he. [...] "I'll bet you a new bonnet on it, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was, perhaps, in <b>these</b> Hamburg <b>days</b> <b>that</b> Heine {{paid the}} visit to Goethe, of which he gives us this charming little picture: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By your leave, Caesar," [...] {{said the}} blunt soldier, [...] "good swordsmen are too rare in <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> {{we should let}} them slay each other for sport. Perhaps if the Barbarian would wrestle a fall--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> you've been so {{friendly}} an' like a pardner--all these evenin's {{that have}} been so bewilderin' to me--your beauty--an'--an' the way you looked an' came close to me--they were woman's tricks to bind my hands?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're afraid you'll take cold," [...] said Flo. [...] "This is desert {{country with}} high altitude. Spring is here {{when the sun}} shines. But it's only shinin' in streaks <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That</b> means winter, really. Please be good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sorry, Peggy,' he said. 'I'm a fool. It's {{only that}} it all seems so damned hopeless! Here am I, earning about half a dollar a year, and--Still, it's no use kicking, is it? Besides, I may make a home-run with my writing one of <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That's</b> what I meant when I said you were a Billiken, Peggy. Do you know, you've brought me luck. Ever since I met you, I've been doing twice as well. You're my mascot.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Describing {{the aim of}} the album, Jon said, [...] "I {{heard someone}} say that albums were dead… and {{everyone}} just wants three minute songs <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That's</b> exactly {{what we are trying to}} fight with this record. We hit reset on what this band was about, threw everything out and just imagined the record we would want to hear someone else make." [...] "I think we just wanted to challenge ourselves and explore something new as a band. A concept album is something we've wanted to do for a really long time", said Jon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] said Tell. [...] "Oho! so it's you, is it? I know you. And a nice sort {{of person}} you are, with your taxes on bread and sheep, aren't you! You'll come to a bad end one of <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> <b>that's</b> {{what will happen to}} you. Oh, you old reprobate! Pooh!" [...] And he had passed on with a look of scorn, leaving Gessler to think over what he had said. And Gessler ever since had had a grudge against him, and was only waiting for a chance of paying him out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were too}} good for the job," [...] she declared. [...] "What is there in it? There ain't nobody {{converted}} <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> I can see, and what's the use of gettin' up and preach {{into a lot of}} sapheads that don't know what religion is? Sure they don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean--my {{peculiar}} scent? Correct {{the impression}} that I intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by, {{in the hope that}} one of <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> dashed animal will decide that I smell all right." [...] I thought for a bit. [...] "Jeeves!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Notify the police, {{and have}} them butt in and stop the thing and kill a good story!' There was honest amazement in the Press-agent's voice. 'Let me tell you, it isn't so easy to get {{publicity}} <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> {{you want to go}} out of your way to stop it!' ...|$|E
5000|$|The actual words Ash says are: [...] "Naturally enough ... {{the others}} have been doing their utmost to match this {{performance}} ... this is something people get when they continually drink whisky...

50|$|According to Alexander Rosenberg {{philosophers}} mostly <b>these</b> <b>days</b> believe <b>that</b> reduction between sciences {{is possible}} in principle but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which natural sciences are involved, for instance from biology to chemistry.|$|R
5000|$|A 1999 {{article in}} The Advocate said of Imperial Teen, [...] "With lyrical allusions to wearing {{lipstick}} and male pronouns used to address love objects, Imperial Teen serves up a gay sensibility that ordinarily surfaces only from straight bands like Pulp or Pizzicato Five." [...] Bottum noted [...] "I think there's a resistance from gay artists {{to go that}} route just because it's so predictable. But it is annoying to see bands play it as safe as they do <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That's</b> why something that visually screams as loud as Marilyn Manson is such {{a breath of fresh}} air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now," [...] went on Hollis, [...] "don't be an idiot. You {{know very}} well that nobody spouts any stuff like that <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That</b> sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets. Cut out that right-arm {{exercise}} and the Adam and Eve stunt, and make your captain talk as you or I or Bill Jones would." ...|$|E
60|$|Fine lodgings these {{proved to}} be indeed, since, as they found, no house in Avignon was better {{furnished}} with all things needful. But, and this will show how dreadful were the times, during <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> they made this their home they never so much as learned {{the name of that}} poor lady arrayed in the bride's dress and laid out upon her marriage bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{bad time}} for colds," [...] said the doctor, sitting down and attacking the fire. [...] "I dare say, though, {{you have to run}} so fast <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> a cold couldn't catch you. I suppose you'll soon be leaving Sampson's. He told me he didn't need you after the holiday season was over. What are you going at next? Have you {{anything}} in view?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} {{hard for him to}} remain with the Frenchman all <b>these</b> <b>days</b> for <b>that</b> very reason, and that he had unselfishly done so spoke more glowingly of his nobility of {{character}} than even did his rescuing the French officer from Mbonga's clutches.|$|R
50|$|In Poland to <b>these</b> <b>days</b> {{it means}} <b>that</b> {{there is no}} man that a freeman (a better, {{philosophical}} meaning of szlachcic) would {{think of as a}} superior.|$|R
50|$|It {{is rather}} unknown, <b>these</b> <b>days</b> on campus, <b>that</b> the Fieldhouse once {{witnessed}} concerts by Jimi Hendrix, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't think what's {{got into}} the younger people <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> they seem so {{indifferent}} to religion. Your father's a vestryman, Phil, and I believe {{it has always been}} his hope that you would succeed him. I'm afraid Rex won't succeed his father," [...] she added, with a touch of regret and a glance of pride at her husband. [...] "You never go to church, Rex. Phil does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every {{young girl}} and woman, who in her sphere and by her example shows {{that she is}} not ashamed of {{domestic}} labor, and that she considers the necessary work and duties of family life as dignified and important, is helping to bring on this good day. Louis Philippe once jestingly remarked, 'I have this qualification for being a king in <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> <b>that</b> I have blacked my own boots, and could black them again.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{appeared}} to notice him. He so seldom came to London <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> he was practically {{a stranger in}} the club; {{and in any case}} your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure for observing anything not immediately {{on the table in front}} of him. To attract attention in the dining-room of the Senior Conservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, you have to be a mutton chop--not an earl.|$|E

5000|$|The song Miss America {{discusses}} {{the corruption of}} an artist when he has the chance for commercial appeal and corruption of government when capitalism is involved. When speaking about the single with Billboard Cole said, [...] "I’m gonna try {{to use it to}} shift culture just a little bit. To me, 'Miss America' shifts things a little bit, it changes the conversation it takes it in a more aggressive direction, more raw, more social commentary... Any type of commentary is good compared to what a normal single is <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>That’s</b> my aim, is to shift culture slightly, change the conversation. Nobody expects that for your first single." ...|$|R
