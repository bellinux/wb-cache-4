5000|$|Canadian Taxpayers Federation {{director}} John Williamson mentioned and applauded {{that the}} registered savings plan was [...] "very good" [...] {{for the middle}} class. Economist Andrew Jackson, from the Canadian Labour Congress, mentioned however that the plan will give little to the average worker while Don Scott, a <b>taxation</b> <b>specialist,</b> added that the program may incite some investors to contribute less to their RRSP. The creation of the new savings account also had positive reviews from several Canadian newspapers including Le Devoir, La Presse, The Globe and Mail and the National Post. Aaron Freeman, policy director for the Environmental Defence, criticized the government for having no clear direction on the environment making reference to the suspension after 2008 of the tax-rebate program on fuel-efficient vehicles but praised the funding for transit and {{for the protection of}} consumers from toxins in products.|$|E

A beneficial researcher scheme with low <b>taxation</b> of foreign <b>specialists</b> has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour.

These relationships were not present for employees with lower levels of professional commitment. It was also found that <b>taxation</b> <b>specialists</b> perceived the least emphasis in the firm on serving the public interest. Originality/value – No prior study has documented the moderating influence of affective professional commitment on the association between ethical climate and accountants 2 ̆ 7 OPC or OC.

The development of elite patronage, protection and <b>taxation</b> of artisans, <b>specialist</b> traders and their activities is viewed as a strategy of mutual benefit and alliance between elites and specialists. By the later tenth and eleventh centuries some merchant-artisans, usually citizens of major towns, became indistinguishable from the lower aristocracy as they possessed both urban residences and rural estates.
