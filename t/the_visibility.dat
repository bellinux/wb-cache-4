40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-cost {{system for the}} measurement of atmospheric <b>visibility.</b> <b>The</b> measurement setup is composed by a consumer digital camera which is controlled by a computer. The camera acquires photos of the landscape that include natural dark objects.

Two different approaches are proposed so {{that the system is}} able to measure <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>visibility</b> both under normal and low <b>visibility</b> conditions. <b>The</b> use of the three color channels of the camera allows the measurement of the extinction coefficient at different wavelengths along with the Angström exponent which is an important parameter in the classification of atmosphere aerosols.

Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E

40|$|The {{upcoming}} Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA) {{will operate}} at 326. 5 MHz which {{corresponds to the}} redshifted 21 -cm signal from neutral hydrogen (HI) at z = 3. 35. We present two different prescriptions to simulate this signal and calculate <b>the</b> <b>visibilities</b> expected in radio-interferometric observations with OWFA. In the first method we use an input model for the expected 21 -cm power spectrum to directly simulate different random realizations of the brightness temperature fluctuations and calculate <b>the</b> <b>visibilities.</b> This method, which models the HI signal entirely as a diffuse radiation, is completely oblivious to the discrete nature of the astrophysical sources which host the HI. While each discrete source subtends an angle that is {{much smaller than the}} angular resolution of OWFA, the velocity structure of the HI inside the individual sources is well within reach of OWFA's frequency resolution and this is expected {{to have an impact on}} the observed HI signal. The second prescription is based on cosmological N-body simulations. Here we identify each simulation particle with a source that hosts the HI, and we have the freedom to implement any desired line profile for the HI emission from the individual sources. Implementing a simple model for the line profile, we have generated several random realizations of <b>the</b> complex <b>visibilities.</b> Correlations between <b>the</b> <b>visibilities</b> measured at different baselines and channels provides an unique method to quantify the statistical properties of the signal.
