5000|$|Twinsburg Stamping was a Chrysler {{automobile}} {{factory in}} Twinsburg, Ohio. The factory opened in 1957 and closed on July 31, 2010. It processed, on average, over 26,000 tons of steel {{a month and}} shipped stamped panels to assembly plants in Mexico, the United States, Austria, and Canada. The former Chrysler Corporation began modernizing the press room with new Verson [...] "C" [...] Transfer Presses in 1994. This modernization continued, even after the merger with Germany's Daimler-Benz, through the early 2000s. New equipment included additional Verson Transfer Presses {{as well as new}} Schuler and Mueller Weingarten Transfer and <b>Tandem</b> <b>Presses.</b> New Schuler blankers were also added during the early 2000s, and the plant quickly {{became one of the most}} modern stamping plants in North America. Through numerous bad decisions from parent company DaimlerChrysler, the company slid into another one of its bust cycles. After the bankruptcy of 2009, the President's Automotive Task Force decided that Twinsburg would close, and the plant was put up for auction. As of August 1, 2012, the only part of the plant still standing is the main cafeteria and administration building.|$|R

40|$|Food-deprived rats in Experiment 1 {{responded to}} one of two tandem {{schedules}} that were, with equal probability, associated with a sample lever. The tandem schedules' initial links were different random-interval schedules. Their values were adjusted to approximate equality in time to completing each tandem schedule's response requirements. The tandem schedules differed in their terminal links: One reinforced short interresponse times; the other reinforced long ones. Tandem-schedule completion presented two comparison levers, one of which was associated with each <b>tandem</b> schedule. <b>Pressing</b> the lever associated with the sample-lever tandem schedule produced a food pellet. Pressing the other produced a blackout. The difference between terminal-link reinforced interresponse times varied across 10 -trial blocks within a session. Conditional-discrimination accuracy increased with the size of the temporal difference between terminal-link reinforced interresponse times. In Experiment 2, one tandem schedule was replaced by a random ratio, while the comparison schedule was either a tandem schedule that only reinforced long interresponse times or a random-interval schedule. Again, conditional-discrimination accuracy increased with the temporal difference between the two schedules' reinforced interresponse times. Most rats mastered the discrimination between random ratio and random interval, showing that the interresponse times reinforced by these schedules can serve to discriminate between these schedules...|$|R
40|$|Rats' lever presses and drinking-tube {{contacts}} {{were studied}} under fixed-interval schedules of food presentation and under a tandem schedule composed of three fixed intervals. One group of rats was exposed {{first to the}} tandem schedule, next to fixed-interval schedules of comparable interpellet intervals, and once again to the tandem schedule; a second group of rats was exposed first to a fixed-interval {{and then to the}} tandem schedule. Under the <b>tandem</b> schedule, lever <b>presses</b> occurred at a higher rate and were more uniformly distributed in time than under the fixed-interval schedule. Tube contacts emitted by rats exposed first to a fixed-interval schedule consisted mostly of tongue contacts, which occurred at a high rate shortly after food; tube contacts emitted by rats exposed first to the tandem schedule consisted mostly of paw contacts, which occurred at a lower rate at times other than shortly after food. Changing the schedule from fixed interval to tandem decreased the frequency of tongue contacts for all rats. Under schedules of food presentation with comparable interpellet intervals, the schedule of food presentation, rather than the rate of food delivery per se, determined the topography and temporal locus of drinking-tube contacts...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} argues that, {{during the}} second {{decade of the twentieth}} century, adolescent girls helped shape America's film fan culture. Though many film histories address the contributions of female audiences during the silent era, seldom are girls recognized as an independent and vital target demographic. In my dissertation, I propose that seminal conceptions of affective movie fandom and film consumption are interlaced with {{the emergence of a new}} life- stage: that of female adolescence. In 1904, American psychologist G. Stanley Hall defined adolescent girls as highly susceptible, romantic, and rabid consumers. A decade later, popular newspapers and fan magazines represented the typical "movie-mad" fan as a white female consumer in her teens. Surveying early-twentieth-century psychology and educational literature in <b>tandem</b> with <b>press</b> depictions of screen-struck girlhood, I propose that the birth of a commercial film fan culture is intrinsically linked with the rise of female adolescence. However, I also suggest that the relationship established between the first generation of adolescent girls and a burgeoning film industry was rather complex and symbiotic. Exploring the letters girls sent to the <b>press</b> in <b>tandem</b> with their unpublished fan archives [...] private movie scrapbooks, journals, collages, and correspondence [...] my work sets out to document the voices of the first movie girl fans. To reclaim a marginalized history of girl agency and authorship, I privilege previously unexamined autobiographical materials [...] such as personal diaries, published collages, and suicide notes [...] authored both by individual girl fans and girls-only film collectives during the 1910 s. By examining girls' first-person fan testimonies side by side press representations of movie-loving girlhood, my research seeks to challenge a long-standing, albeit constructed notion, that early Hollywood was built fundamentally on male agency and mature labor. Marked by material loss, much of our contemporary understanding of American silent cinema has been biased by surviving accounts relayed by renowned filmmakers and film critics, most of them adult males. However, as my archival research evinces, during this transitional decade adolescent girls' fan practices, their affect, and their craft labor importantly impacted the ways American film was produced, promoted, and consumed...|$|R

40|$|Motion {{planning}} for robot operations {{is concerned with}} path planning and trajectory generation. In multi-robot systems, i. e. with multiple robots operating simultaneously in a shared workspace, the motion planning also needs to coordinate the robots' motions to avoid collisions between them. The multi-robot coordination decides the cycle-time for the planned paths and trajectories since it determines to which extend the operations can take place simultaneously without colliding. To obtain the quickest cycle-time, there needs to bean optimal balance between, {{on the one hand}} short paths and fast trajectories, {{and on the other hand}} possibly longer paths and slower trajectories to allow that the operations take place simultaneously in the shared workspace. Due to the inter-dependencies, it becomes necessary to consider the path planning, trajectory generation and multi-robot coordination together as one optimisation problem in order to find this optimal balance. This thesis focusses on optimising the motion {{planning for}} multi-robot material handling systems of sheet metal parts. A methodology to model the relevant aspects of this motion planning problem together as one multi-disciplinary optimisation problem for Simulation based Optimisation (SBO) is proposed. The identified relevant aspects include path planning,trajectory generation, multi-robot coordination, collision-avoidance, motion smoothness, end-effectors' holding force, cycle-time, robot wear, energy efficiency, part deformations, induced stresses in the part, and end-effectors' design. The cycle-time is not always the (only) objective since it is sometimes equally/more important to minimise robot wear, energy consumption, and/or part deformations. Different scenarios for these other objectives are therefore also investigated. Specialised single- and multi-objective algorithms are proposed for optimising the motion planning of these multi-robot systems. This thesis also investigates how to optimise the velocity and acceleration profiles of the coordinated trajectories for multi-robot material handling of sheet metal parts. Another modelling methodology is proposed that is based on a novel mathematical model that parametrises the velocity and acceleration profiles of the trajectories, while including the relevant aspects of the motion planning problem excluding the path planning since the paths are now predefined. This enables generating optimised trajectories that have tailored velocity and acceleration profiles for the specific material handling operations in order to minimise the cycle-time,energy consumption, or deformations of the handled parts. The proposed methodologies are evaluated in different scenarios. This is done for real world industrial case studies that consider the multi-robot material handling of a multi-stage <b>tandem</b> sheet metal <b>press</b> line, which is used in the automotive industry to produce the cars' body panels. The optimisation results show that significant improvements can be obtained compared to the current industrial practice...|$|R

50|$|A robot then {{transfers}} the aluminium blanks {{into the}} <b>tandem</b> <b>press</b> lines where the sheets are stamped into the various panels of the cars. The Schuler SMG hydraulic stamping press {{line is the}} largest in North America and the 6th largest in the world. The presses use up to 11,000 ton-force to form the body panels; the upper section applies 1400 tonnes of downward force and the lower section 130 tonnes. The blank aluminium sheet is stretched over the lower draw die and openings are cut with robots transferring the panels between processes. The workers then inspect each panel to ensure correct pressing. The parts are then stacked in frames and stored. The machines press one part every 6 seconds and create 5,000 parts per day.|$|E

40|$|Automated {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} automotive <b>tandem</b> <b>press</b> lines include time dependent complex control functions. All motions and critical interactions between moving parts must be synchronised to avoid collisions and reach high production rate. It is even for a skilled operator hard to optimise these processes on-line. Therefore, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation including real industrial control systems and its control code establish an essential tool for optimisation. Additionally, an efficient optimisation algorithm is required to reach a useful simulation-based optimisation method. This paper proposes a new optimisation algorithm starting with the Lipschitzian algorithm DIRECT as global search and then switches over to the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm for local convergence. During the switch over, the new algorithm determines all local candidates of the set of points evaluated by DIRECT and starts multiple Nelder-Mead local searches in each of these. An optimisation study for an automotive press line shows that the proposed algorithm combines {{the benefits of the}} Lipschitzian and the simplex algorithms in an efficient way. The importance of multiple local searches from all local candidates found is also shown in the study. Based on the same number of function evaluations, it is also shown that this algorithm reaches improved press line performances compared to the stochastic differential evolution algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} of compliant parts during material handling {{is a critical}} issue that can significantly affect the productivity and the parts' dimensional quality. There are multiple relevant aspects to consider when designing end-effectors to handle compliant parts, e. g. motion planning, holding force, part deformations, collisions, etc. This paper focuses on multi-robot material handling systems where the end-effector designs influence the coordination of the robots to prevent that these collide in the shared workspace. A multi-disciplinary methodology for end-effector design optimisation and multi-robot motion planning for material handling of compliant parts is proposed. The novelty is the co-adaptive optimisation of the end-effectors' structure with the robot motion planning to obtain the highest productivity and to avoid excessive part deformations. Based on FEA, the dynamic deformations of the parts are modelled in order to consider these during the collision avoidance between the handled parts and obstacles. The proposed methodology is evaluated for a case study that considers the multi-robot material handling of sheet metal parts in a multi-stage <b>tandem</b> <b>press</b> line. The results show that a substantial improvement in productivity can be achieved (up to 1. 9 %). These also demonstrate the need and contribution of the proposed methodology.
