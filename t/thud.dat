5|$|<b>Thud,</b> 2002, by Trevor Truran, {{publisher}} The Cunning Artificer. It resembles ancient Norse games such as Hnefatafl, {{and involves}} two unequal sides, Trolls and Dwarves with different moves and 'capture' abilities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Lionel, [...] "if he bides." [...] He {{felt his}} mouth turn dry as he spoke; his heart <b>thudded,</b> but its <b>thuds</b> were {{softened}} by a slight insensibility which the liquor had produced in him.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{from behind}} the closed door of the inner room, {{she was aware of}} a strange, {{shuffling}} sound. She listened, astonished. She heard a gasp, then curious <b>thuds,</b> finally a bump louder than the <b>thuds.</b> And then there was silence.|$|R
60|$|Blicky darted {{through the}} door and his {{footsteps}} <b>thudded</b> out of hearing.|$|R
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud <b>thud</b> on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1972, a Phantom {{flying at}} {{supersonic}} speed shot down a MiG-19 over <b>Thud</b> Ridge in Vietnam {{for the first}} supersonic gun kill. At a recorded speed of Mach 1.2, Major Phil Handley's shoot down {{was the first and}} only recorded gun kill while flying at supersonic speeds.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled <b>thud</b> or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
60|$|From {{some point}} {{farther down the}} {{corridor}} came a muffled <b>thudding.</b> Ann stopped her work to listen.|$|R
60|$|Low, muttered curses, then {{mingled with}} dull <b>thuds</b> of hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses.|$|R
6000|$|The candle {{slanting}} sooty wick'd, [...] The <b>thuds</b> {{upon the}} thatch, The eaves-drops {{on the window}} flicked, [...] The clacking garden-hatch, ...|$|R
5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The <b>thud</b> of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E
25|$|The {{board game}} <b>Thud</b> (2002) {{was created by}} puzzle {{compiler}} Trevor Truran.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Chicago {{increased}} its lead with Gould nailing a 41-yard field {{goal for the}} only score of the period. However, in the fourth quarter, New York took the lead with QB Eli Manning completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with RB Reuben Droughns. The Bears did have one final attempt, but it ended with a <b>thud.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then a small blunt skiff--manned by two rowers came by {{under the}} wall, with the <b>thudding</b> and the creak of oars.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone: [...] "Whereupon {{the record}} segues into the Number One hit 'Boom Boom Pow,' and all hell breaks loose. There are Auto-Tune vocal trills, eerie synth chords, screechy disco-diva wailing, 808 <b>thuds,</b> raps about 808 <b>thuds</b> and a dizzying barrage of doggerel: 'I got that [...] [...] [...] digital spit/Next-level visual shit.' It is {{an assault on}} the senses, and on good taste. And it's the best thing The Black Eyed Peas have ever recorded." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{a moment}} when the steadiest pulse [...] <b>Thuds</b> pit-a-pat. The crisis shapes and nears [...] For Wellington as for his counter-chief.|$|R
25|$|Reggae drummers often {{involved}} {{these three}} tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum {{so that it}} tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy <b>thud,</b> and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.|$|E
25|$|Snow's first second-spell {{over the}} Walters and Redpath resembles {{one of those}} oldtime bombardments on the World War I Western Front. His first {{delivery}} was just short of a length and straight. His second was a lofty bumper, under which Walters ducked. His third was lifting offside ball...The fifth ball, called a no ball by Umpire Rowan, {{was perhaps the most}} vicious bumper of all...Redpath turned his back on this one and the <b>thud</b> on his rump could be heard from most parts of the ground.|$|E
25|$|Softly, {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade. A lone rook stirred in the tall beeches nearby, troubled by the {{relentless}} purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night breeze. A mighty arm nudged the building. There was no crash, not even a rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to <b>thud</b> in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.|$|E
60|$|With a soft <b>thudding</b> {{upon the}} sand, and a clatter among the stones the weary pony was off upon her journey once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{added another}} voice, which broke harshly through the <b>thuds</b> of hoofs, [...] "ten teams wouldn't move {{the man who}} rode away." ...|$|R
60|$|There was not {{the faintest}} sound in the house. Beatrice stood in the gloom of the landing, her heart <b>thudding</b> in her ears.|$|R
25|$|When Karou and {{her best}} friend Zuzana are at a restaurant, Kishmish flies in bearing a letter from Brimstone saying to come immediately. Karou is sent off to Paris via a magical door to get a seven-foot-long {{matching}} pair of elephant tusks. When she finds another portal back to Brimstone's shop, she notices a scorched black handprint on the door, but fortunately she is able to get back home. Similar handprints are appearing across the world. When Karou returns to Brimstone's shop, a violent <b>thud</b> strikes the second door to the shop that Karou is forbidden from investigating.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a <b>thud.</b> Both were tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{manages to}} capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, {{flickering}} lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches {{and there is}} a loud <b>thud,</b> causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.|$|E
60|$|My {{heart was}} <b>thudding</b> with the guns, {{and it was}} all that I could do to answer her for the catch of my breath.|$|R
50|$|He {{was already}} a fast {{freestyle}} swimmer with a <b>thudding</b> kick {{when he went to}} Xalapa to study law and to be coached in swimming.|$|R
60|$|The boys made further efforts. Foam lapped {{about the}} bows, the splash of paddles swelled into a {{resonant}} <b>thudding,</b> and Gilby pulled hard upon his helm.|$|R
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the <b>thud</b> of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thud,</b> {{a modern}} game {{inspired}} {{by a series of}} fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett (which in turn were inspired by the historical tafl games), also features the general symmetry of tafl games, although it is played on an octagonal board with only eight defenders pitted against thirty-two attackers. <b>Thud</b> also features a [...] "Thudstone" [...] (cf. konakis), but no kingpiece. There are also important differences in the moves and attacks in <b>Thud.</b>|$|E

60|$|My heart <b>thudded</b> violently in that moment, as I {{looked into}} that pale face of sorrow. Then Fra Gervasio {{began to speak}} very gently and softly.|$|R
60|$|Three minutes later, {{to their}} {{infinite}} surprise, the bridge <b>thudded</b> down to span the ditch, and I walked out upon it with Bianca at my side.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped the}} man obediently, though with protest writ large on her face; {{and his body}} <b>thudded</b> to the floor. Bonner nudged him with his moccasined foot.|$|R
