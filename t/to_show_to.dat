Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his {{loneliness}} and now having to raise his sons alone. To help him get on with his life, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> single girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, {{but none of them}} are successful.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in tandem}} with larger Serb and Czech {{national}} units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway were involved in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> the Entente that Romanians were still eager {{to fight against the}} Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with the Bolshevik or anarchist cells. They resisted especially when the Bolshevik Russian government asked them to surrender all weapons.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, the CIA agents {{presented}} {{the results of}} their first two weeks of work in Washington. At Wisner's request, Tracy Barnes created a booklet from these documents <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> US President Dwight Eisenhower. The 23 documents in the booklet included Communist literature owned by Árbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying Communist sympathies, and Árbenz's wife Maria Cristina Villanova's copy of a biography of Joseph Stalin. After the presentation, Frank Wisner decided that the examination of the seized documents needed to proceed faster, and so expanded the group of agents working in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Portugal {{designated}} Mozambique {{an overseas}} territory in 1951 in order <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> {{the world that}} the colony had a greater autonomy. It was called the Overseas Province of Mozambique (Província Ultramarina de Moçambique). Nonetheless, Portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province. The increasing number of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population, encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were {{about the size of}} a quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what would prove to be the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors was revised in late 1977 for {{publication}} as an AD module. In 1978, TSR, Inc. published the module with a monochrome cover, revised and updated {{for use with}} first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The module included a twenty-page book, a twelve-page book, and an outer folder; the original printing featured a two-color cover. The module features a book of illustrations <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> players as the adventure unfolds. Tomb of Horrors was republished in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with identical text but a new, full-color cover. The module {{has been described as}} {{the first of a series}} of high-level scenarios, and was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{conceived}} {{of the film}} after Bartley returned from documenting {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and ÓBriain shot more than 200hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.|$|E
5|$|The {{same day}} in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst {{working in the}} CTC, was told to review {{material}} about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number. In late August 2001, Gillespie told the INS, the State Department, the Customs Service, and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents {{in the search for}} the duo, which hindered their efforts.|$|E

Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas {{in the same manner}} as Jane Goodall had with chimpanzees in Tanzania. Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.|$|E

Having analyzed the data, the writer finds that there are nine intentions of criticism utterances. The intentions are to contradict, to advice, to mock, to order, to judge, to forbid, to satire, to remain and treat, and to blame. There are six reasons of criticism utterances; they are <b>to</b> <b>show</b> power, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> anger, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> disappointment, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> intimacy, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> solidarity, and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> astonishment.

Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.|$|E

France instead focused on another treaty also under development. In May 1950 France had proposed the European Coal and Steel Community with the purpose of ensuring French economic security by perpetuating access to German Ruhr coal, but also <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. and the UK that France could come up with constructive solutions, as well as to pacify Germany by making it part of an international project.|$|E

John Paul joined other brothers and sisters already living in California. Pedro Nuno left to the Congo. Geraldo went to Angola and Clotilde went to Mozambique. On the account of Andrée`s spending habits, Sousa Mendes also started to have disputes with his brothers Cesar and Joao Paulo and his cousin Silverio.|$|E

The participants partook of whisky toddy served in a punch-bowl. It is not recorded who was the victor on this occasion, however the judge was John, son of Edward Whigham. Joseph Train also records this story and adds that the whistle had been partly renewed since it was won from Anne of Denmark's courtier and that it was usually accompanied by a large 'highly mounted Scandinavian drinking horn' - Burns had borrowed both.|$|E
25|$|As the antisemitic {{policies}} of the Third Reich took effect, Jewish musicians were forced {{out of work and}} began to leave Germany. The Nazis were aware that Furtwängler was opposed to the policies and might also decide to go abroad, so the Berlin Philharmonic, which employed many Jews, was exempted from the policies. In 1933, when Bruno Walter was dismissed from his position as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Nazis asked Furtwängler to replace him for an international tour. Their goal was <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> the world that Germany did not need Jewish musicians. Furtwängler refused, and it was Richard Strauss who replaced Walter.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, Paul Rose {{as leader}} of the FLQ's Chenier Cell joined with members Jacques Rose (brother), Bernard Lortie, and Francis Simard to kidnap Quebec Vice Premier and cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to have Quebec live up to the fate wished for it by the Lower Canada rebellions of 1837-8, namely to become an {{independent}} country. However, the kidnapping did not work out as planned and they killed Laporte. The FLQ said they killed him without hesitation in order <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> the population they were serious. In 1971, Rose was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Laporte and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
