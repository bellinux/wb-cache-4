25|$|Some teas, {{especially}} green teas {{and delicate}} oolong teas, are steeped for shorter periods, sometimes less than 30 seconds. Using a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer</b> separates the {{leaves from the}} water {{at the end of}} the brewing time if a tea bag is not being used. However, the black Darjeeling tea, a premium Indian tea, needs a longer than average steeping time. Elevation and time of harvest offer varying taste profiles; proper storage and water quality also have a large impact on taste.|$|E

40|$|From the {{theoretical}} fluid dynamics point of view, the wake region {{of a large}} horizontal-axis wind turbine has been defined and described, and numerical models of wake behavior have been developed. Wind tunnel studies of single turbine wakes and turbine array wakes {{have been used to}} verify the theory and further refine the numerical models. However, the effects of scaling, rotor solidity, and topography on wake behavior are questions that remain unanswered. In the wind tunnel studies, turbines were represented by anything from scaled models to <b>tea</b> <b>strainers</b> or wire mesh disks whose solidity was equivalent to that of a typical wind turbine. The scale factor compensation for the difference in Reynolds number between the scale model and an actual turbine is complex, and not typically accounted for. Though it is wise to study the simpler case of wakes in flat topography, which can be easily duplicated in the wind tunnel, current indications are that wind turbine farm development is actually occurring in somewhat more complex terrain. Empirical wake studies using large horizontal-axis wind turbines have not been thoroughly composited, and, therefore, the results have not been applied to the well-developed theory of wake structure. The measurement programs have made use of both in situ sensor systems, such as instrumented towers, and remote sensors, such as kites and tethered, balloonborne anemometers. We present a concise overview of the work that has been performed, including our own, which is based on the philosophy that the MOD- 2 turbines are probably their own best detector of both the momentum deficit and the induced turbulence effect downwind. Only the momentum deficit aspects of the wake/machine interactions have been addressed. Both turbine power output deficits and wind energy deficits as measured by the onsite meteorological towers have been analyzed from a composite data set. The analysis has also evidenced certain topographic influences on the operation of spatially diverse wind turbines...|$|R
25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. <b>Strainers,</b> <b>tea</b> balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|R

50|$|Cannabis-infused butter, also {{referred}} to as cannabutter, is a cannabis-infused ingredient used in many cannabis edibles. Heating the raw cannabis in melted butter allows the cannabinoids to be extracted by the fat.

50|$|Dried teas as loose tea or {{tea bags}} are {{prepared}} for drinking by steeping the leaves in just boiled or heated water to release the flavour and nutrients in the dried tea into the water.

5000|$|When tea is brewed in the {{traditional}} manner in a teapot, the tea leaves are not contained in teabags, but rather are freely suspended in the water. As the leaves themselves may be distasteful, it is usual to filter them out with a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer.</b> Strainers usually fit {{into the top of}} the cup to catch the leaves as the tea is poured.|$|E

50|$|Some deeper tea {{strainers}} {{can also}} be used to brew single cups of tea, much as teabags or brewing baskets are used - the strainer full of leaves is set in a cup to brew the tea, and then removed, along with the spent tea leaves, when the tea is ready to drink. By using a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer</b> in this way, the same leaves can be used to brew multiple cups.|$|E
50|$|The infuser {{is placed}} in a cup or pot of hot or boiling water, {{allowing}} the tea to brew without loose tea leaves spilling into the pot or cup. A rod or chain is commonly attached to the container of the infuser to simplify retrieval from the pot or cup.

5000|$|After {{a cup of}} tea {{has been}} poured, without using a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer,</b> the tea is drunk or poured away. The cup should then be shaken well and any {{remaining}} liquid drained off in the saucer. The diviner now looks at the pattern of tea leaves in the cup and allows the imagination to play around with the shapes suggested by them. They might look like a letter, a heart shape, or a ring. These shapes are then interpreted intuitively or by means of a fairly standard system of symbolism, such as: snake (enmity or falsehood), spade (good fortune through industry), mountain (journey of hindrance), or house (change, success).|$|E
5000|$|Gongfu cha, meaning [...] "making {{tea with}} skill", {{is a popular}} method of {{preparing}} tea in China. It makes use of small Yixing teapots holding about 100 - 150 ml (4 or 5 fl.oz.), the size being thought to enhance the aesthetics and to [...] "round out" [...] {{the taste of the}} tea being brewed. Brewing tea in a Yixing teapot can be done for private enjoyment as well as to welcome guests. Depending on the region of China, there may be differences in the steps of brewing as well as the tools used in the process. For example, Taiwanese-style gongfu cha makes use of several additional instruments including tweezers and a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer.</b> The procedure is mostly applicable to oolong teas, but it is some used to make pu'er and other fermented teas.|$|E

It could be - it was certainly somebody special." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{historical}} {{origin of}} the tetsubin is not certain. At least one authoritative Japanese source states that it developed from the spouted and handled water kettle called tedorigama that was already being used in chanoyu {{in the era of}} Sen no Rikyū (1522-91). During the 19th century, infused tea became more popular and tetsubin were considered primarily status symbols rather than functional kitchen items. Outside Japan, a frequently seen variant is a cast-iron teapot that outwardly resembles a tetsubin. This type of teapot is glazed with enamel on the inside to make it more practical for tea brewing, though it can't be used to heat water because that would break the enamel coating. In the west, these teapots are commonly referred to as tetsubin, although the Japanese call them [...] "tetsu kyūsu" [...] (鉄急須), or iron teapot, to make a distinction from the kettle. Cast-iron teapots often come with a <b>tea</b> <b>strainer</b> that fits inside.|$|E
50|$|A teapot is {{a vessel}} used for {{steeping}} tea leaves or an herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water, and for serving the resulting infusion {{which is called}} tea. Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea, in which case a tea infuser or <b>tea</b> <b>strainer</b> may be of some assistance, either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured. Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top, where the dry tea and hot water are added, a handle for holding by hand and a spout through which the tea is served. Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout. A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured. In modern times, a thermal cover called a tea cosy {{may be used to}} enhance the steeping process or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly.|$|E
