40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{conditions under}} which an industry-wide practice of posted (or list) pricing is a plus factor sufficient to conclude that firms established an agreement to coordinate their prices. For certain classes of markets, it is shown that, under competition, all firms setting a list price with a policy of no discounting is contrary to competition. Thus, if all firms choose posted pricing, it is to facilitate collusion by {{making it easier for}} them to coordinate their prices. It is then argued that the adoption of posted pricing communicates the necessary intent and reliance to conclude concerted action.

40|$|Effective {{management}} educators play many {{roles in}} their classrooms. They are experts, formal authorities, personal models, facilitators, and delegators (Grasha, 1994), {{to name just}} a few. Webelieve there is another role being played by some of the best management educators that is not explicitly discussed in the existing literature. The role is that of the teacher as coach— an educator who blends the best of instruction with a personalized strategy for helping students practically apply concepts and theories to their own life experience in order to develop their individual knowledge, skills, and abilities. We define coaching in the classroom environment as working with stu-dents to increase their self-awareness and capacity for self-discovery, while motivating them to begin a process of continuous learning and development. We believe coaching should be a key behavior for management educators because {{one of the most important}} functions of management education is helping students become aware, self-reflective citizens.

40|$|We thank Chang and Lin {{for their}} <b>thoughtful</b> <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>comments</b> on our study (Park et al. 2010). In Park et al. (2010), {{we did not}} {{explicitly}} state that the topography-forced stationary waves are the direct cause for the reduced downstream transient eddy kinetic energy (EKE). The response of stationary waves to topography may saturate even with a relatively small mountain (Cook and Held 1992); furthermore, their magnitudes are much smaller than thermally forced stationary waves (Chang 2009; Held et al. 2002). Instead, we suggest that quasistationary waves generated by the central Asian mountains may strongly affect North Pacific storminess by changing the year-to-year variability of westerly winds over the eastern Eurasian continent. Observational analyses indicate that the midwinter suppression of North Pacific storminess does not occur every year. Some years experience stronger and more meridionally confined zonal winds over the western North Pacific, leading to stronger midwinter suppression (Harnik and Chang 2004; Nakamura and Sampe 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|Following {{accumulative}} advantage studies {{based on}} career performance in science, we demonstrate the generality {{of the phenomenon}} through a syn-thetic cohort analysis of Protestant clergy, using a composite measure of profes-sional resources. These resources are distributed more unequally in older than in younger cohorts within a total sample drawn from 21 denominations and also within 7 denominational subsamples. This finding suggests {{the presence of an}} underlying process of accumulative advantage generating inequalities. In this study we draw on recent research in the sociology of science to explore the structure of career attainment processes in the Protestant parish ministry. In doing so, we assume that the formal mechanisms through which career mobility takes place are very similar from occupation to occu-pation, although the nature of these mechanisms can differ greatly. We focus here on the process Merton in 1942 termed the "accumulation of dif-ferential advantages " (273). After describing the use to which sociologists of science have put this concept, we argue that it is best understood when applied to occupational stratification systems as a process which generates inequalities in the distribution of the resources on which members of a cohort draw in the performance of their occupational roles. We then seek evidence of such a differential accumulation of occupational advantages within the Protestant parish ministry. Our study is thus one of a small but increasing number of recent efforts to understand intraoccupational mobility (e. g., Stewman; Talbert and Bose; White), where status attainment is of greatest subjective salience. We test for the presence of accumulative ad-vantage by examining the degree of inequality contained in successive distributions of parish resources available to a synthetic cohort of clergy. *We have benefited greatly from the <b>thoughtful</b> <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>comments</b> Paul D.

40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The “Acheulean” is comprised of individual knapping events undertaken by individual hominins. In other words, it is a particular component of hominin behavior that we draw out and amalgamate into a wider “pattern. ” The resultant phenomenon (i. e., “the Acheulean”) is an entity that stretches over the space of three continents and spans a time period in excess of one million years. If such an exercise has any merit, it is because it provides a means of comparative (behavioral) analysis over these swathes of time and space. Comparative research can document, measure, and statistically assess temporo-spatial patterns of artifactual variation, and so test hypotheses regarding {{the character of that}} variation. However, it does not provide an independent means of examining some of the key phenomena which it is necessary to further understand in order to increase our comprehension of this archaeological legacy. Here, we review and synthesize recent experimental work that we have undertaken, which has specifically investigated some of the factors potentially responsible for the generation and constraint of variation within the Acheulean techno-complex. We examine issues of raw material, copying errors, and their relationship to mechanisms of social learning. Understanding these microevolutionary factors via experiments, we contend, is essential in order to reach a secure understanding of the macroscale phenomenon typically referred to as the “Acheulean. ” Moreover, we outline how a “quantitative genetic” framework to these issues provides an essential means of linking these inherent micro- and macro-evolutionary factors into a coherent whole, while also simultaneously reconciling the potential influence of different sources of variation that are part of a temporally and geographically dispersed entity such as the Acheulean. We thank Marie-Hélène Moncel and Daniele Schreve for their invitation to take part in this issue. We are also grateful to the four reviewers (Michael O'Brien and three anonymous), whose <b>thoughtful</b> <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>comments</b> on the manuscript were much appreciated.

40|$|Changes in the {{concentrations}} of atmospheric greenhouse gases {{are an important part}} of the global climate forcing. The hypothesis that benthic foraminifera are useful proxies of local methane emission from the seafloor has been verified on sediment cores by numerous studies. The calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) content and the high-resolution carbon and oxygen isotope composition of the benthic foraminifera from the core 08 CF 7, from the northeastern Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area in the Baiyun Sag of the northern South China Sea were analyzed, and the benthic foraminifera's evidence for methane release from gas hydrate decomposition are presented here for the first time. Two rapid obvious carbon isotope negative excursions were observed in the oxygen isotope stage boundaries 5 d/ 5 c and 6 / 5 e (penultimate deglaciation, about 130 ka) of the cold-to-warm climatic transition period. The largest negative value of delta C- 13 is about - 2. 95 aEuro degrees, and the whole change of carbon and oxygen isotope is strikingly similar and is in consonance with the atmospheric methane concentration recorded by the Vostok ice core and the carbon isotopic record from Lake Baikal. Combining these results with the analysis of the geological conditions of the study area and the fact that gas hydrate exists in the surrounding area, it can be concluded that the carbon isotope negative excursions of the benthic foraminifera in the northern South China Sea are associated with methane release from gas hydrate decomposition due to deglacial climate warming. By recording the episodes of massive gas hydrate decomposition closely linked with the northern hemisphere temperatures during major warming periods, the new delta C- 13 record from the Baiyun Sag provides further evidence for the potential impact of gas hydrate reservoir on rapid deglacial rises of atmospheric methane levels.
