Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa pledged to withdraw IPKF {{as soon as}} he is elected president during his presidential election campaign in 1988. After being elected, in April 1989, he started negotiations with LTTE. President Premadasa ordered the Sri Lanka Army to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy, the <b>Tamil</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> (TNA). These consignments included RPG guns, mortars, self-loading rifles, T81 automatic rifles, T56 automatic rifles, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition, and communications sets.

CVF {{consisted}} of ex cadres of PLOTE and TELO, trained by Indian government. Perumal said that the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) would not be needed in the province. On 1 March 1990, when India was ready to withdraw their forces, Perumal passed a resolution in the council to declare independence for Eelam. After his declaration, Sri Lankan government dissolved the provincial council and imposed the direct rule on it. After the failed attempt, Perumal self-exiled to India. Perumal opposed LTTE and its leader V. Prabhakaran. LTTE called him as a traitor and tried to kill him.|$|E

These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and they allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a ceasefire. But the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent hostilities. In April 1989, the Ranasinghe Premadasa government ordered the Sri Lanka Army to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy <b>Tamil</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> (TNA). Although casualties among the IPKF mounted, and calls for {{the withdrawal of the}} IPKF {{from both sides of the}} Sri Lankan conflict grew, Gandhi refused to remove the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, following his defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, the new prime Minister V. P. Singh ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF, and their last ship left Sri Lanka on 24 March 1990. The 32-month presence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka resulted in the deaths of 1200 Indian soldiers and over 5000 Sri Lankans. The cost for the Indian government was estimated at over ₹10.3 billion.|$|E

5000|$|From the outset, Comrade Thiyagu courageously {{pointed out}} Communist Party of India (Marxist)'s wrong {{policies}} related to Eelam. On 15 September 1987, Thileepan began his hunger strike in Eelam. Comrade Thiyagu {{and some of}} his friends began [...] "Thileepan Forum" [...] to support him. At the meeting held on that day, Comrade Thiyagu explained about Eelam struggle in detail to the people. He did not hesitate to critique his party’s wrong views about the Eelam struggle.

50|$|While most Tamil {{militant groups}} laid down {{their weapons and}} agreed to seek a {{peaceful}} solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters. Keen to ensure {{the success of the}} accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils. Simultaneously, nationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and the government allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a cease-fire. However, the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent clashes.
