5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> not clear, but {{it is known that}} the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> unknown.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{attendance}} {{recorded at}} Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for the 1937 British Home Championship tie between Scotland and England. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a European record {{for an international}} match. The 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, a world record for a club match, with 20,000 more people locked outside. Hampden set world attendance records that year that were only surpassed by the Maracanã, and it still holds all the major European records. The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear {{candidate for}} a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx plays an important role, {{not only in the}} study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> debated.|$|E
5|$|West Bromwich Albion's record {{victory was}} their 12–0 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the widest {{margin of victory}} for a game in the top-flight of English football, {{although}} the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909. Albion's biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 10–1 on 2 March 1889. The club's record league defeat was a 3–10 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937, while a 0–5 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albion's heaviest FA Cup loss.|$|E

5|$|To {{secure a}} first round bye, the Giants needed to beat {{two of the}} NFL's worst teams, the Phoenix Cardinals and New England Patriots on the road. The Giants won the Cardiinals game 24–21. Their game against the Patriots was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the trip up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The Patriots, who came in 1-14 and on a 13-game losing streak in a scandal-plagued season, played the Giants better than expected, but missed a field goal that proved the {{difference}} as the Giants held on for a 13-10 win. The win secured a 13-3 record, and the playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. The team discipline Parcells installed was exemplified by the Giants setting the record for fewest turnovers in a season with 14 (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the NFL record as of 2007).|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
