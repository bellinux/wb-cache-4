Although the income gap between wealthy and poor farmers did grow under the NEP, it remained quite small, but the Bolsheviks began to <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> at the wealthy kulaks. Clearly identifying this group was difficult, though, since only about 1% of the peasantry employed laborers (the basic Marxist definition of a capitalist), and 82% of the country's population were peasants.|$|E
500|$|Around 461 BC, the {{leadership}} of the democratic party {{decided it was time to}} <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> at the Areopagus, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state. The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, Ephialtes, proposed a reduction of the Areopagus' powers. The Ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of [...] "radical democracy".|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} event, The Portland Mercury Erik Henriksen {{encouraged}} {{readers to}} join the march, writing: [...] "Trump's hostility to science isn't just an attack on humankind's accumulated knowledgeâ€”it's an attack on all of us, and its repercussions will affect everyone on Earth, every day, {{for the rest of}} our lives. Time to fight back." [...] KOIN said organizers portrayed the demonstration as [...] "political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under President Donald Trump". Similarly, Maggie Vespa of KGW said, [...] "Although organizers trumpeted the event's 'nonpartisan' platform, participants in Portland were quick to <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> at President Trump's proposed funding cuts to scientific research agencies." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's combat {{focuses on}} velocity, and {{encourages}} players to defeat enemies in a fast-paced way. As a result, players can employ different moves including wall running, air-dashing, zip lining, performing parkour, acrobatics, and water traversal. Players use grind rails to deftly navigate city streets, {{and are able}} to switch direction instantly at will. The city is also filled with items for players to bounce up into the air. Players may utilize their weapons while performing these movements and slow down time for players to <b>take</b> <b>aim.</b> On-foot, players cannot walk, take cover, or take out enemies silently, but instead must rely on agility to survive as they will be overwhelmed quickly by enemies if they choose to walk on the ground. The game also features a Style Meter. Shown in the head-up display (HUD) of the game, the Meter increases as players perform stylish moves like killing enemies and grinding on-rails without touching the ground. When players are killed, {{they do not have to}} wait for the game to load. Players can respawn and return to the world by different methods, such as descending with a rocket or exiting a golden sarcophagus. Insomniac named this system [...] "Next-Gen Respawning".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} being {{a witness in}} Ryan's trial, where he gave {{evidence}} claiming to have seen him commit the murder, a man broke his silence, for fear that the alleged killer was becoming a latter-day Ned Kelly. Les Watt wrote to The Australian: [...] "Let me assure you and your readers that Ryan did kill Hodson." [...] Watt spoke out after reading Philip Opas' comments and the latter's autobiography. Watt {{was one of four}} witnesses to testify seeing Ryan fire a shot. Watt said that it might well be proper for Opas to leave the bar as his emotional involvement with the case had certainly distorted the facts, leading as it had to the suggestion that Ryan might not have fired the shot that killed Hodson. Watt, on the contrary, said that he saw Ryan <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> and fire and then saw Hodson fall flat on his face and not move. [...] "It was a sickening sight. I also witnessed a slight puff of smoke come from the carbine Ryan used. This was probably {{as a result of a}} bullet passing through a well-oiled barrel bore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mayer's most {{powerful}} poems speak {{of loss and}} longing, and express a deep sadness. The poet Elaine Feinstein for example observed in a 1996 review that [...] "most readers ... will have paused over that poignant poem, 'Make Believe'", in which Mayer imagines her father alive again. There is a wistfulness, too, when she writes about the countryside (of both her native and adoptive lands). These poems rarely fall {{into the trap of}} self-pity, though Mayer can veer in that direction when writing about the minor disappointments of life. In the poems [...] "My Aunt Selfpity" [...] and [...] "Selfpity Again" [...] she first identifies, then renounces, her dependence on that negative emotion to inspire her, though she also fears that without it her poems would be [...] "bland and blank". The majority of Mayer's poems however are sharp and entertaining observations of familiar human foibles, domestic life and growing old grudgingly. Her wry sense of humour is never far away, and in poems such as [...] "The Poetry Reading" [...] and [...] "Drip Drip or Not Bloody Likely" [...] she is quite happy to <b>take</b> <b>aim</b> at the poetry scene and fellow poets.|$|E
