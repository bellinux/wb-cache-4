5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media.

Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

As part of <b>this</b> <b>press</b> conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half.

Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind the entry from Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Belt press- <b>This</b> <b>press</b> {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt.

Belt presses have been used by high volume wineries for whole-cluster pressing and sparkling wine production but it has not caught on in many wine regions due to concerns about the amount of oxidation it introduces to the wine as well as the large amount of suspended solids that get past the screens.|$|E
25|$|When Gounod's Shakespeare adaptation, {{the opera}} Roméo et Juliette, {{appeared}} at the Théâtre Lyrique in 1867, it provided additional impetus for Thomas to finish working on his own adaptation of Hamlet. According to accounts in the press, it was that same year, at his publisher Heugel's office in Paris, that Thomas met the Swedish soprano Christine Nilsson, {{who had just been}} engaged at the Opéra. Thomas finally consented to the scheduling of the premiere. Consistent with <b>this</b> <b>press</b> report, parts of the soprano role were altered around this time with Nilsson's capabilities in mind. Thomas replaced a dialog with the women's chorus in the Mad Scene in act 4 with a Swedish Ballade. This Ballade resembles the first movement of Grieg's Op. 63 (Two Nordic Melodies), and its use was suggested to Thomas by Nilsson.|$|E

The following year (1962), RMIT bought a lithography press. King {{was one of the}} few able to use it. From then on King concentrated on producing lithographs and creative monotypes. In 1965, he acquired a small off-set litho press (12 ins x 15 ins or about 30.5 x 38.1cm) for his studio at Warrandyte. Although <b>this</b> <b>press</b> was “a bit on the small side”, by designing for its limitations King could make larger prints. Some years later, he acquired a larger press which “gave him scope to wield a longer, wider brush-mark on the lithographic plate”.|$|E

25|$|In {{the press}} release issued by the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA, 文建會) on Jan. 23, 2007, it was stated that “according to recent news, some local representatives and {{organizations}} in Taipei City and Taipei County claimed that the 90% Losheng preservation plan proposed by CCA will severely delay the MRT construction. Hereby CCA reiterates that the 90% preservation plan, evaluated by Hsin-Lu cooperation, will lengthen the construction period for about four months, and appends a three billion budget to it.
