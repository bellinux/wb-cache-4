5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> base, invasive vines overrunning <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> face, or the piling of slash against <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> after logging.|$|E
5|$|A further {{variant of}} the hedge hopper idea was devised for St Margaret's Bay where the barrels would be sent rolling over <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> edge.|$|E
5|$|Scar makes a brief cameo {{appearance}} in the film in Simba's nightmare. In the nightmare, an adult Simba runs down <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> where his father died, attempting to rescue him. Scar intervenes, however, and then turns into Kovu and throws Simba off <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> Scar makes another cameo {{appearance in}} a pool of water, as a reflection, after Kovu is exiled from Pride Rock.|$|E

50|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> by car is {{possible}} at The Bight of Hjembæk, 10 km {{north of the}} town, Grenaa. Here <b>the</b> <b>Cliffs</b> of Karlby stretch {{to the north and}} <b>The</b> <b>Cliffs</b> of Sangstrup to the south.|$|R
5|$|Tourists {{and locals}} visit <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> on <b>the</b> {{western side of}} the {{peninsula}} for views of the ocean and the sunset - hence <b>the</b> name, Sunset <b>Cliffs.</b> There are surfing spots below <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> such as Luscomb's, Garbage Beach, and New Break. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> are unstable and can be dangerous; a woman died in a fall from <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> in December 2008, and other falls have resulted in injuries.|$|R
5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron Beach is a surfing and bodyboarding {{location}} for surfers of all levels, {{although it can}} be dangerous at high tide when the waves break directly onto boulders underneath <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> The better surfers head for the northern end.|$|E
5|$|After reuniting Kevin {{with her}} chicks, Carl and Russell fly the {{dirigible}} {{back to the}} city. Carl presents Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Meanwhile, Carl's house has landed on <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> consist {{mainly of}} beds of Namurian shale and sandstone, with the oldest rocks being {{found at the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> It is {{possible}} to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bird life in Drangey is {{varied and}} lively, {{but the most}} common are diving birds: the {{guillemot}}, auk and puffin. The guillemot nests in <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> while <b>the</b> auk mostly prefers deep cracks underneath <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> <b>The</b> puffin, on the other hand, digs holes in the edge of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> In addition to these species, the black-legged kittiwake and fulmar nest in <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> and <b>the</b> raven and falcon also have their sanctuaries there.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} depth and {{consistent}} nature of the alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness. The pointed shape of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave, {{and there are no}} vertical joints in the rock above.|$|E
5|$|At the castle, Charles {{has begun}} to regret Madeleine's {{transformation}} and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner stops her. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
50|$|These initial {{setbacks}} {{resulted in}} a 40-minute delay in landing {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> but British landing craft carrying the Rangers finally reached the base of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> at 7:10am with approximately half the force it started out with. The landing craft were fitted with rocket launchers to fire grapnels and ropes up <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> As <b>the</b> Rangers scaled <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> <b>the</b> Allied destroyers USS Satterlee and HMS Talybont provided them with fire support and ensured that the German defenders above could not fire down on the assaulting troops. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> proved to be higher than the ladders could reach.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> {{around this}} Tower are eroding very badly. Serious cracks are {{visible on the}} surface of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> near <b>the</b> Tower and huge holes can be seen on the wall of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> This tower may {{eventually}} collapse when the terrain on which it's built gives in.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> dwellings, Mesa Verde boasts {{a number of}} mesa-top ruins. Examples open to public access include the Far View Complex and Cedar Tree Tower on Chapin Mesa, and Badger House Community, on Wetherill Mesa.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob and Patrick board {{a bus to}} go {{home from}} Glove World, which is a glove-themed {{amusement}} park. They accidentally board the wrong bus, which then takes them to a 90-degree cliff. <b>The</b> <b>cliff</b> leads to a abyssopelagic zone called Rock Bottom, which is inhabited by many strange deep-sea animals.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> are {{a popular}} picnic, rock {{climbing}} and abseiling site. The steepness of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> was increased by quarrying operations which mined the volcanic rock or rhyolite lava flows which form <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> <b>The</b> lava was {{deposited in the}} Triassic Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form {{the banks of the}} Brisbane River.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is named}} for <b>the</b> sheer <b>cliffs</b> which border <b>the</b> ocean. There are surfing spots below <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> <b>The</b> cliffside trails are popular for walking and for {{watching}} the sunset, but are undeveloped and can be dangerous. Falls from <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> have resulted in deaths and injuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{headland}} {{is within}} the Trevose Head and Constantine Bay Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which is designated for both its biological and geological interests. Wild asparagus grows on <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> of Dinas Head and shore dock {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> are also important for breeding fulmar, razorbill and guillemot.|$|R
5|$|The town is {{overlooked}} by North Hill, {{and is just}} outside the boundaries of Exmoor National Park. <b>The</b> <b>cliff</b> exposures around the shoreline are dramatic and fossils are exposed. Areas of the town included Higher Town, Quay Town and Lower or Middle Town, although {{they are no longer}} separate.|$|E
5|$|There are no snakes, no highly venomous or {{stinging}} insects, {{animals or}} plants, and no dangerous daytime sharks off the beaches. Although {{there are reports}} of tiger sharks on <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> side of the island.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, the Bureau of Reclamation and the State of Arizona {{agreed on}} an {{alternative}} to Orme. This was known as Plan 6, and it recommended four projects: a reconstruction of the Stewart Mountain Dam, a new or larger Roosevelt Dam, <b>the</b> <b>Cliff</b> Dam on the Verde River and finally, the New Waddell Dam on the Agua Fria River (a tributary of the Gila River). On November 6, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt recommended Plan 6. In April 1984, it was approved {{with the exception of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cliff</b> Dam, which needed further study and would eventually be removed from CAP.|$|E
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> Some stonechats and meadow pipits gather on the meadow, while rock pipits move along the base of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> House martins make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of <b>the</b> chalk <b>cliffs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Clare County Council {{initiated}} {{development plans}} to enable visitors to experience <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, <b>the</b> <b>Cliffs</b> of Moher Visitor Experience was {{built into a}} hillside approaching <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> <b>The</b> centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling.|$|R
50|$|The €32 million {{facility}} was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Facility exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, {{flora and fauna}} of <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> A large multimedia screen displays a bird's-eye view from <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> as well as video from the underwater caves below <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b>|$|R
5|$|After passing Carlyon Bay {{the path}} {{comes to the}} much busier china-clay {{exporting}} port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, {{with the}} bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George's island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after {{crossing}} the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues up onto <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth {{carved into the}} turf of the hillside to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{retrieves}} the ATAC {{system and}} stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden flick knife, but is {{killed by a}} knife thrown by Columbo; Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond throws it off <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> Bond and Melina later spend a romantic evening aboard her father's yacht when he receives {{a call from the}} Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|By mid-July, the Japanese troops {{no longer}} used ladders {{to climb up}} <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b> Instead, they used the piles of their corpses as ramps to scale <b>the</b> <b>cliffs.</b>|$|R
