Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to <b>take</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying.

Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married Toirdelbach's son, Tadc (died 1086).
