Inside historical Zeppelins, the gas cells were separate entities from the hull; however, on the Zeppelin NT, the envelope serves both as the aircraft's hull and as the gas cell. It is made of a three-layered laminate: one gas-tight layer of Tedlar (PVF), one polyester fabric layer to provide stability and one polyurethane layer suitable for <b>thermic</b> <b>welding</b> that acts to connect the separate laminate panels. To preserve its outer form, a slight overpressure of about [...] is maintained within the hull. As in blimps, the interior pressure is kept constant at all flight altitudes by using ballonets.

The thermite (or aluminothermic) reaction {{is one in which}} aluminum metal is oxidized by an oxide of another metal, usually iron oxide, producing great heat in the process. Goldschmidt was originally interested in producing very pure metals by avoiding the use of carbon in smelting, but he soon realized the value in welding, a process known as <b>thermic</b> <b>welding.</b> It is also used in incendiary devices. This process is sometimes called the [...] "Goldschmidt reaction" [...] or [...] "Goldschmidt process", because he furthered its development and patented it in 1895. He would also go on to publish an extensive paper on it in 1898.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, passanger {{train speed}} and freight train load have {{increased}} to enhance efficiency of rail road transportation. These trends {{have increased the}} severity of rail service conditions, calling for rails with greager wear resistance, strength and fatigue behavior. In the United States and Europe, track site weld rails are made entirely by alumino thermic process. This work describe the results of experimental study conducted on bending fatigue strength of plain rails and alumino <b>thermic</b> <b>welded</b> rails with preheating procedures (oxipropane and air-induced propane) approved by railways authorities. Compliance with the required fatigue strength shall be ascertained by 4 point pulsating bending test in accordance with European standard by alumino <b>thermic</b> <b>weld</b> in rails. The Locati method, based in the empirical Miner's law about the cumulative damage on a fatigue tested material, allows, once known the Wohler curve of the welding process in use to settle the fatigue tensile limit at 50 % with only one test. The values obtained at 2. 10 cycles for plain rails (Sf = 353 MPa), oxipropane preheated aluminothermic weld rails (Sf = 225 MPa), and propane-air induced aluminothermic weld rails (Sf = 210 MPa) {{are very similar to}} those resulting from test method stated in the European Standard. From our point of view and due to its ease, speediness and savings, this is the most suitable test to check the quality and compare the aluminothermic processes in use. En los últimos años la eficiencia de los FECC, tanto para el transporte de viajeros como de mercancías, ha experimentado un desarrollo espectacular. Ello, ha sido posible gracias, entre otros factores, a la fabricación de carriles con resistencia al desgaste, carga de rotura y resistencia a fatiga mejoradas. La soldadura de los carriles, en Europa y U. S. A. se realiza "in situ" por aluminotermia con precalentamiento de los carriles con oxipropano o propano-aire inducido. Los ensayos de fatiga de los carriles soldados se llevan a cabo por flexión en cuatro puntos en concordancia con la norma europea. El método Locati, descrito en esta nota, está basado en la Ley de Miner de daño acumulado y en las curvas de Wohler del material ensayado. Permite calcular, con precisión suficiente, las tensiones límites de fatiga al 50 %. Así, los valores obtenidos, en ensayos a dos millones de ciclos, para carriles sin soldar (Sf = 353 MPa), carriles soldados con precalentamiento de oxipropano (Sf = 225 MPa) y carriles soldados con precalentamiento de propano-aire inducido (Sf = 210 MPa) son muy similares y aceptables a los estipulados por los métodos de determinación del límite de fatiga según norma europea. Debido a la comodidad, rapidez y bajo coste del método Locati resulta, en nuestra opinión, muy adecuado para el control de calidad de los procesos de soldadura aluminotérmica en vigor, de carriles de alta resistencia...|$|R
