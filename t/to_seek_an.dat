His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E

5|$|Eckfeldt {{served a}} quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises. As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which evolved into the National Numismatic Collection. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt {{continued}} {{to perform the duties}} of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, Franklin Peale, <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> assistant.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Poland-Pomerania {{alliance}} {{ended up}} in regaining the fortresses in Gdańsk and the complete expulsion of the Brandenburg forces from Pomerania. Although soon after Mestwin II decided to conclude a separate peace with the Margraviate, the alliance with Greater Poland signed in 1272 remained in force. The continuous threat of Brandenburg and {{the uncertainty of the}} alliance with Mestwin II, caused that Bolesław the Pious began to seek new allies in case of war. For this purpose, Bolesław decided <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> agreement with Duke Barnim I of Pomerania.|$|E

5|$|The {{stands and}} {{terraces}} were {{arranged in a}} haphazard manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay, a stadium in Halifax.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{postponement}} {{because of}} the death of her maternal uncle, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her father did not approve of the match; in his view Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> annulment of his own marriage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E

The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> audience with Hunson Abadeer if they want to leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. Just then, a storm cloud appears in a mist, slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death.|$|E
5|$|Kieswetter played junior cricket for Western Province {{until the}} age of 18, but lack of {{opportunity}} led him <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> alternative route in England. He studied at Millfield, where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of South Africa, Graeme Smith, invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England.|$|E

5|$|The Wiz is a 1978 American musical {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Universal Pictures and Motown Productions, and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. An urban reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an entirely African-American cast, The Wiz was loosely {{adapted from the}} 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. The film follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy twenty-four-year-old Harlem, New York City, schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles an alternative fantasy version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say {{is the only one}} powerful enough to send her home.|$|E
5|$|The eldest living {{brother of}} the late King Robert, Stannis Baratheon, announces himself as {{rightful}} heir to the Iron Throne. From his court {{on the island of}} Dragonstone, he sends a letter to all the corners of the Seven Kingdoms announcing that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella Baratheon are not Robert's true heirs, but rather the products of incest between Cersei Lannister and her twin brother Jaime. Stannis refuses <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> alliance with Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, despite the advice of his advisor Ser Davos Seaworth, because he sees them as usurpers; Stannis insists that all will bend the knee to him or be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inaugural}} 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor {{controversy}} erupted when one opposition {{member of parliament}} (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge suit and tie {{instead of the usual}} official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other MPs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> audience with him.|$|E
5|$|Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio, Norberto Galasso, and Jorge Abelardo Ramos {{attempt to}} rescue the image of Moreno by {{avoiding}} both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists. Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno, and the proposals <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> alliance with Britain are not seen {{as the product of}} anglophilia, but just an example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta. Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the Representation..., considering it a mere work for a client that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts. The harsh policies are acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca, the La Paz revolution, and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{smuggling}} of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century AD Byzantine historian Menander Protector wrote {{of how the}} Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian Persian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> audience with the Sasanian king of kings {{for the privilege of}} travelling through Persian territories to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sasanian king, the latter had the members of the embassy killed by poison. Maniakh, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 AD and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also an alliance against Sasanian Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy under Zemarchus to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E
