2500|$|After Indian {{independence}} {{and until the}} end of the Cold War, the relationship between the US and India was cold and often thorny. This was due to the closeness of the US towards India's arch-rival Pakistan during the War, with Pakistan joining the US-led Western Bloc in 1954. India's policy of being not aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union, but maintaining close ties with the latter, also impacted relations. American officials perceived India's policy of non-alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position. Grady told the State Department in December 1947 that he had informed Nehru [...] "that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> that cannot be straddled and that India should get on the democratic side immediately.|$|E

Political moderation is a contested concept, and various authors have a {{put forth a}} range of opinions on the issue. For some, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of using violence or not: a Western author, (Eric Trager), interviewing 30 current and {{former members of the}} Brotherhood in 2011 and found that the Brethren he talked to emphasised [...] "important exceptions" [...] to the position of non-violence, namely conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq, and Palestine. Trager quotes the former Supreme Guide Mohammed Mahdi Akef as telling him We believe that Zionism, the United States, and England are gangs that kill children and women and men and destroy houses and fields. ....

[...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or two and a half years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of language at all.

40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at really in order to account for its various interpretations. Stenstrm's (1986) work on really forms the starting-point for the investigation. The {{following}} examples are from Stenstrm (1986 : 151), where she claims that the different readings of really are due to position and syntactic function: (1) <b>this</b> question <b>is</b> really surprising (2) <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really surprising <b>question</b> (3) <b>this</b> <b>is</b> really <b>a</b> surprising <b>question</b> (4) <b>this</b> really <b>is</b> <b>a</b> surprising <b>question</b> (5) really <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> surprising <b>question</b> Stenstrm states that when really is placed next to the adjective, as in (1) and (2), it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> degree modifier which serves as an intensifier of surprising. But, the further really is moved to the left, the less is the emphasis on surprising and the more it is on the whole <b>a</b> surprising <b>question.</b> When really is placed in initial position, as in (5), it no longer intensifies a single clause element but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> comment on the whole proposition. Stenstrm remains vague about the intermediate positions and about the more exact interaction between syntactic position and interpretation. She concludes that what finally decides the function of really is the combined effect of position, prosody and the wider context. In contrast to Stenstrm, I propose that the motivating factors for the readings are semantic/pragmatic in nature rather than syntactic/positiona...|$|R
