25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean <b>that,</b> <b>say,</b> the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E

500|$|The lead-up to Adore {{was marked}} by {{conflicting}} statements as to the album's sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading {{in the direction of}} the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven [...] "The End is the Beginning is the End" [...] in summer 1997. while the band's management reported the album would be all-acoustic. In early 1998, Corgan called the sound [...] "arcane night music", elaborating, [...] "The people <b>that</b> <b>say</b> it's acoustic will be wrong. The people <b>that</b> <b>say</b> it's electronic will be wrong. The people <b>that</b> <b>say</b> it's a Pumpkins record will be wrong. I will try to make something that is indescribable". Further complicating the situation was the record label's initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin produced, upbeat, poppy song [...] "Let Me Give the World to You" [...] as the album's lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners the wrong first impression of the album. Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.|$|E

500|$|Piller {{originally}} envisioned only casting actors {{between the}} ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs.

He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached on the grounds that the [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E
