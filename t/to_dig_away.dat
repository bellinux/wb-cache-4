And right while Peter {{was looking}} at him, he began to sink down into the ground until only {{the top of his}} head could be seen. Then that disappeared. Old Mr. Toad had gone down, and the sand had fallen right back over him. Peter just had to rub his eyes again. He had to! Then, to make sure, he began <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> the sand where Old Mr. Toad had been sitting. In a minute he felt Old Mr. Toad, who at once came out again.|$|E
60|$|I spared no pains {{indeed in}} this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I think, {{three or four weeks}} about it; at last finding it {{impossible}} to heave it up with my little strength, I fell <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> <b>away</b> the sand <b>to</b> undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.|$|R
60|$|It {{appeared}} {{as if the}} earth Poyor had dug up {{from the middle of}} the fortification was all heaped above him in such a manner that he could do nothing in his own behalf, and it was only necessary <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> this <b>away.</b>|$|R

60|$|Oh, how Peter Rabbit did {{wish that}} he had not been so curious to know what Farmer Brown had been doing that day, and {{that he had}} gone {{straight}} home as he had meant to do, instead of trying to get one more meal of young peach bark! Big tears rolled down Peter's cheeks. What should he do? What could he do? For a long time Peter sat in the moonlight, trying to think of something to do. At last he thought of the stake to which that hateful wire was fastened. The stake was of wood, and Peter's teeth would cut wood. Peter's heart gave a great leap of hope, and he began at once <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> the snow from around the stake, and then settled himself to gnaw the stake in two.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} that all was ready and every man {{had been given to}} drink from the great jars of water which stood along the walls, the massive wooden doors began to burn through, though this did not happen for quite half an hour after the enemy had begun to attempt to fire them. They fell at length beneath the {{battering}} of poles, leaving only the mound of earth and stones which we had piled up in the gateway after the closing of the doors. This the Black Kendah, who had raked out the burning embers, set themselves <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> with hands and sticks and spears, a task that was made very difficult to them by about a score of our people who stabbed at them with their long lances or dashed them down with stones, killing and disabling many. But always the dead and wounded were dragged off while others took their places, so that at last the gateway was practically cleared. Then I called back the spearmen who passed into the ranks behind us, and made ready to play my part.|$|E
60|$|Still, the queer object {{interested}} him languidly, by its odd {{and timely}} {{connection with the}} subject of his morning sermon; and he looked at it again a little more closely. By Jove, yes, it was a feather, not a doubt in the world of that now; he could see distinctly the central shaft of a tail-quill, and the little barbed branches given off regularly on either side of it. The shale on which it was impressed was a soft, light-brown mudstone; in fact, a fragment of lithographic slate, exactly like that employed by lithographers for making pictures. He could easily see how the thing had happened; the bird had fallen into the soft mud, long ages since, before the shale had hardened, and the form of its feathers had been distinctly nature-printed, while it was still moist, upon its plastic surface. But a bird in the oolite! that was a real discovery; and, as the Gospel Evangelists were no Sabbatarians, Cyril did not scruple in the pursuit of Truth <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> at the thin slab with his knife, till he egged it out of the rock by dexterous side pressure, and laid it triumphantly down at last for further examination on the big stone that stood before him.|$|E
5000|$|The Case of Mines or R v Earl of Northumberland {{was decided}} in 1568.

50|$|There {{were three}} {{standard}} ways <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunnelling. Entrenching, {{where a man}} would stand {{on the surface and}} dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large <b>digging</b> party <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. Sapping involved extending the trench by <b>digging</b> <b>away</b> at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time.|$|R
50|$|The kagu is {{exclusively}} carnivorous, {{feeding on}} a variety of animals with annelid worms, snails and lizards being amongst the most important prey items. Also taken are larvae, spiders, centipedes and insects such as grasshoppers, bugs, and beetles. The majority of the diet is obtained from the leaf litter or soil, with other prey items found in vegetation, old logs and rocks. Sometimes kagus will hunt small animals in shallow water. Their hunting technique is to stand motionless on the ground or from an elevated perch, and silently watch for moving prey. They may stand on one foot and gently move the leaf litter with the other foot in order to flush prey. Having located prey they will move towards the prey and stand over it, ready to strike, or make a dash towards the prey from their watching location. If <b>digging</b> is required <b>to</b> obtain the prey this is done with the bill, the feet are not used <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> or scratch <b>away</b> debris.|$|R
6000|$|Martin was youthful, rash, and impetuous; excelling {{in all the}} {{exercises}} which distinguish a mountaineer, and brave and undaunted from his familiar intercourse with the dangers that attend them. He laughed at the timidity of his brothers. [...] "Tell me not of such folly," [...] he said; [...] "the demon is a good demon--he lives among us {{as if he were}} a peasant like ourselves--haunts the lonely crags and recesses of the mountains like a huntsman or goatherd--and he who loves the Harz forest and its wild scenes cannot be indifferent to the fate of the hardy children of the soil. But, if the demon were as malicious as you would make him, how should he derive power over mortals, who barely avail themselves of his gifts, without binding themselves to submit to his pleasure? When you carry your charcoal to the furnace, is not the money as good that is paid you by blaspheming Blaize, the old reprobate overseer, as if you got it from the pastor himself? It is not the goblins gifts which can endanger you, then, but it is the use you shall make of them that you must account for. And were the demon to appear to me at this moment, and indicate to me a gold or silver mine, I would begin <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> even before his back were turned,--and I would consider myself as under protection of a much Greater than he, while I made a good use of the wealth he pointed out to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Graboids are {{depicted}} as highly intelligent, possessing {{memory and the}} ability to learn. For instance, in the first Tremors film the characters successfully killed a Graboid by having it swallow homemade dynamite. The second Graboid (nicknamed [...] "Stumpy" [...] by Val) had apparently noticed this trap and simply regurgitated the dynamite. Other examples are when the characters escaped on a bulldozer which was too big to be toppled (weighing 30 tons) or undermined (it could drive away before the Graboids had a chance <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> enough of the dirt under it), the creatures dug a trap in its path.|$|E
5000|$|The Tunnel is a {{novel about}} a man named William Frederick Kohler and his attempt to write an {{introduction}} to his historical magnum opus, [...] "Guilt and Innocence in Hitler's Germany." [...] But when Kohler tries to flesh out this minor introduction, mostly {{for the purposes of}} gloating over his colleagues, he instead finds himself writing a deeply personal book about the history of his own life. As the novel progresses we see the lies, half-truths, violent emotions, and relative chaos of Kohler's life laid bare, and while he continues <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> at the memories of his past he also begins digging a tunnel out from the basement where he works, a reflection of his tunneling through himself. The novel addresses ideas about history, evil, and the living and the dead.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} Wolfert went on digging, but {{the field was}} extensive, and as his dream had indicated no precise spot, he had <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> at random. The winter set in before one-tenth of the scene of promise had been explored. The ground became too frozen and the nights too cold for the labors of the spade. No sooner, however, did the returning warmth of spring loosen the soil, and the small frogs begin to pipe in the meadows, but Wolfert resumed his labors with renovated zeal. Still, however, the hours of industry were reversed. Instead of working cheerily all day, planting and setting out his vegetables, he remained thoughtfully idle, until the shades of night summoned him to his secret labors. In this way he continued <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> from night <b>to</b> night, and week to week, and month to month, but not a stiver did he find. On the contrary, the more he digged the poorer he grew. The rich soil of his garden was <b>digged</b> <b>away,</b> and the sand and gravel from beneath were thrown to the surface, until the whole field presented an aspect of sandy barrenness.|$|R
5000|$|In Deut. 3:11 {{and later}} in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the Rephaim. Rephaim is a Hebrew word for giants. Deut. 3:11 {{declares}} that his [...] "bedstead" [...] (translated in some texts as [...] "sarcophagus") of iron is [...] "nine cubits in length and four cubits in width", which is 13.5 ft by 6 ft according to the standard cubit of a man. It {{goes on to say that}} at the royal city of Rabbah of the Ammonites, his giant bedstead could still be seen as a novelty at the time the narrative was written. If the giant king's bedstead was built in proportion to his size as most beds are, he may have been between 9 and 13 feet in height. However, later Rabbinic tradition has it, that the length of his bedstead was measured with the cubits of Og himself. The Talmud further embellishes in fantastic detail that Og was so large that he sought the destruction of the Israelites by uprooting a mountain so large, that it would have crushed the entire Israelite encampment. The Lord caused a swarm of ants <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> the center of the mountain, which was resting on Og's head. The mountain then fell onto Og's shoulders. As Og attempted to lift the mountain off himself, the Lord caused Og's teeth to lengthen outward, becoming embedded into the mountain that was now surrounding his head. Moses, fulfilling the LORD's injunction not to fear him, seized a stick of ten cubits length, and jumped a similar vertical distance, succeeding in striking Og in the ankle. Og fell down and died upon hitting the ground. It is noteworthy that the region north of the river Jabbok, or Bashan, [...] "the land of Rephaim", contains hundreds of megalithic stone tombs (dolmen) dating from the 5th to 3rd millennia BC. In 1918, Gustav Dalman discovered in the neighborhood of Amman Jordan (Amman is built on the ancient city of Rabbah of Ammon) a noteworthy dolmen which matched the approximate dimensions of Og's bed as described in the Bible. Such ancient rock burials are seldom seen west of the Jordan river, and the only other concentration of these megaliths are to be found in the hills of Judah in the vicinity of Hebron, where the giant sons of Anak were said to have lived (Numbers 13:33).|$|E
60|$|There was a {{prize in}} the old blind evidently. But {{what was he doing}} there? Till then I had {{supposed}} that the owl always takes his game from the wing. Farther along the beach was a sand bluff overlooking the proceedings. I gained it after a careful stalk, crept to the edge, and looked over. Down in the blind a big snowy owl was <b>digging</b> <b>away</b> like a Trojan, tearing out sand and seaweed with his great claws, first one foot, then the other, like a hungry hen, and sending it up in showers behind him over the old mast. Every few moments he would stop suddenly, bristle up all his feathers till he looked comically big and fierce, take a look out over the log and along the beach, then fall <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> again furiously.|$|R

60|$|A {{very few}} days in the Warden's hospitable mansion {{produced}} an excellent effect on Redclyffe's frame; his constitution being naturally excellent, and a flow of cheerful spirits contributing much to restore him to health, especially as the abode in this old place, which {{would probably have been}} intolerably dull to most young Englishmen, had for this young American a charm like the freshness of Paradise. In truth it had that charm, and besides it another intangible, evanescent, perplexing charm, full of an airy enjoyment, {{as if he had been}} here before. What could it be? It could be only the old, very deepest, inherent nature, which the Englishman, his progenitor, carried over the sea with him, nearly two hundred years before, and which had lain buried all that time under heaps of new things, new customs, new institutions, new snows of winter, new layers of forest leaves, until it seemed dead, and was altogether forgotten as if it had never been; but, now, his return had seemed <b>to</b> dissolve or <b>dig</b> <b>away</b> all this incrustation, and the old English nature awoke all fresh, so that he saw the green grass, the hedgerows, the old structures and old manners, the old clouds, the old raindrops, with a recognition, and yet a newness.
