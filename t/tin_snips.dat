500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 6, 1997, the 'T's were nearly stolen from the north, south and west sides of Tech Tower by five {{students}} wielding hacksaws, <b>tin</b> <b>snips,</b> and rappelling equipment. The students were caught by Georgia Tech police acting on a tip provided by an anonymous informant. The stolen north 'T' was recovered {{in the back of}} a blue Ford Explorer that was parked at the Copper Kettle on Howell Mill Road, also in response to an anonymous tip. Each student was required to pay $2,446.75 in damages ($ in [...] ) although criminal charges were not filed. The Georgia Tech Office of Facilities reinstalled the 'T' on January 31, 1998, 87days after its attempted theft.|$|E
2500|$|Household {{scissors}} or {{a utility}} knife are sometimes used to open difficult packaging. [...] <b>Tin</b> <b>snips</b> are effective for tough plastics; [...] the higher mechanical advantage of compound metal snips {{make it possible}} to cut such packages open even using little hand strength.|$|E
2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as tinner snips or <b>tin</b> <b>snips,</b> {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades. They usually have extra wide jaws and are made of drop forged carbon steel. Depending on the size of the blade, <b>tin</b> <b>snips</b> can cut between 24 and 16 gauge cold rolled {{low-carbon}} tin. They can be ranged in length from [...] long. There are two main types: straight-pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|E

50|$|Sheet {{metal can}} be cut in various ways, from hand tools called <b>tin</b> <b>snips</b> up to very large powered shears. With the {{advances}} in technology, sheet metal cutting has turned to computers for precise cutting. Many sheet metal cutting operations are based on computer numerically controlled (CNC) laser cutting or multi-tool CNC punch press.|$|E
50|$|Installing {{flexible}} stone veneers {{is typically}} done by cutting the sheet using long nose <b>tin</b> <b>snips</b> and then adhering to a substrate using various adhesives. Because the flexible stone veneer sheets are waterproof {{they can be}} used in most wet locations. These materials hold up to most indoor/outdoor environments other than extreme low freezing conditions. Like real stone these flexible stone veneers can also be sealed using wood or stone sealers to bond and protect the surface while bringing out the colors.|$|E
50|$|A nibbler, or nibblers, is a {{tool for}} cutting sheet metal with minimal distortion. One type {{operates}} much like a punch and die, with a blade that moves in a linear fashion against a fixed die, removing small bits of metal and leaving a kerf approximately 6 mm wide. Another type operates similar to <b>tin</b> <b>snips,</b> but shears the sheet along two parallel tracks 3-6 mm apart, rolling up the waste in a tight spiral as it cuts. Nibblers may be manual (hand operated) or powered.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with <b>tin</b> <b>snips.</b> The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|E

50|$|The company {{became one}} of the nation's largest {{wholesale}} enterprises with nationally known quality brands, among which Blue Grass was the most readily recognizable. John Primble knives, developed by an employee of the company, became a Belknap brand with its own division, made in Louisville between 1947 and 1985 by the John Primble Belknap Hardware Co. The Crusader manufacturing brand of Belknap included contractors' shovels, hammers, hatchets, axes, drawing knives, carpenters' pincers, planes, screw drivers, hand drills, wrecking bars, bit braces, auger bits, chisels, pliers, wrenches, <b>tin</b> <b>snips,</b> and tin ceilings. Other popular Belknap manufactured products included rifles, guns, padlocks, lawn mowers, and bicycles. Belknap inventory in the vast warehouse spaces grew larger and larger, and the Belknap neon sign could be seen from miles away.|$|E
