40|$|Aims: This paper {{assessed}} {{the effect that}} the vertical stratification of nutrients in conservation cropping systems of Australia has on phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fertiliser use efficiency. Methods: Intact soil cores from two long-term tillage experiments, located on a Vertosol and on a Calcarosol were used to assess if tillage system (zero tillage - ZT vs conventional tillage - CT) and soil water influence fertiliser use efficiency (using 33 P and 15 N) of wheat under controlled growth conditions. Results: Adding P increased shoot growth and P uptake on the Calcarosol, provided the surface remained moist and N was applied. The percentage of plant P derived from fertiliser (Pdff) was greater on the Calcarosol regardless of <b>tillage</b> <b>practice.</b> Pdff increased when the soil remained wet or when N was added. The percentage of N derived from fertiliser (%Ndff) was not affected by <b>tillage</b> <b>practice</b> on the Vertosol but when the soil surface was allowed to dry, it was significantly greater under ZT than CT on the Calcarosol. Adding P increased N fertiliser recovery but <b>tillage</b> <b>practice</b> had no effect. Conclusion: The effect of <b>tillage</b> <b>practice</b> on P and N fertiliser use efficiency depends on soil and topsoil water status. R. D. Armstrong, K. Dunsford, M. J. McLaughlin, T. McBeath, S.

50|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{sequestration}} can be reversed. If {{the soil is}} disrupted or <b>tillage</b> <b>practices</b> are abandoned, the soil becomes a net source of greenhouse gases.

50|$|Mechanical soil {{cultivation}} practices, including primary tillage (mold-board or chisel plowing) followed by secondary tillage (disking, harrowing, etc.), break up and aerate soil. When soils become degraded and compacted, such <b>tillage</b> <b>practices</b> are often deemed necessary. The tilth created by tillage, however, {{tends to be}} unstable, because the aggregation is obtained through the physical manipulation of the soil, which is short lived, especially after years of intensive tillage. Aggregates in such soils readily dissolve during subsequent rains, causing the soil to settle and become dense and hard, requiring further tillage.|$|E
50|$|Most crops {{can benefit}} from the {{practice}} of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture. Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation <b>tillage</b> <b>practices,</b> like a combination of strip-till with no-till areas. Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage, mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.|$|E

It should however be noted that tillage activity could reduce topsoil compaction compared to no tillage activity in the long term.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{policies}} have been developed that are intended to inform regulators and private citizens as to how NPS effluent can be better controlled. One example is with the CZMA mentioned earlier, the EPA is required to provide states with a listing of best management practices (BMPs) for controlling NPS coastal pollution. BMPs are state-of-the-art methods to treat NPS pollution. There {{is no shortage of}} BMPs to reduce NPS pollution. For agriculture, examples of BMPs include: conservation easements, cover crops, drainage management, grid sampling, manure injection, manure staging, reduced <b>tillage</b> <b>practices,</b> rotational grazing, and two stage ditches.

The obvious problem with educational and informational tools, however, is there is no guarantee they will be implemented.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} {{alternatives}} to fungicides that are especially preferred by organic farmers, {{such as a}} combination of soil solarization and organic amendment. Soil solarization is a method of using solar power for controlling pathogens in the soil by mulching the soil and covering it with a large, usually transparent polyethylene tarp to trap solar energy and heat the soil. In studies, this method {{has proven to be}} as effective as fungicides. Additionally, crop rotation can be an effective management practice. According to researchers, “Rotation out of soybeans for three years may effectively reduce microsclerotia numbers and is useful for managing charcoal rot” because “corn is not as good of a host to M. phaseolina as soybean so rotation with corn for three years may help reduce populations but not eliminate the pathogen from the soil” Finally, <b>tillage</b> <b>practices</b> can reduce moisture in the soil and make the environment less favorable for the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{methods of}} weed control cause {{physical}} {{changes in the}} immediate environment that may cause positive or negative effects.The suppression of the targeted weeds will open niches in the environment and may also stimulate the growth of other weeds by decreasing their competition and making their environment more favorable. If the niches are not filled by a desirable plant, they will eventually {{be taken over by}} another weed.These weed control methods also effect the structure of the soil. The use of mulches can help decrease erosion, decrease water evaporation from the soil, as well as improve the soil structure by increasing the amount of organic matter. <b>Tillage</b> <b>practices</b> can help decrease compaction and aerate the soil. On the other hand, tillage has also been shown to decrease soil moisture, increase soil erosion and runoff, as well as decrease soil microbial populations. Solarization can cause changes in the biological, physical, and chemical properties of the soil. This can cause the soil to be an unfavorable environment for native species which may be beneficial or harmful.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a change of tillage and crop residue {{management}} practice on the chemical and micro-biological properties of a cereal-producing red duplex soil was investigated by superimposing each of three management practices (CC: conventional cultivation, stubble burnt, crop conventionally sown; DD: direct-drilling, stubble retained, no cultivation, crop direct-drilled; SI: stubble incorporated with a single cultivation, crop conventionally sown), for a 3 -year period on plots previously managed {{with each of the}} same three practices for 14 years. A change from DD to CC or SI practice resulted in a significant decline, in the top 0 - 5 cm of soil, in organic C, total N, electrical conductivity, NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, soil moisture holding capacity, microbial biomass and CO 2 respiration as well as a decline in the microbial quotient (the ratio of microbial biomass C to organic C; P 0. 05). However, there was a significant increase in microbial biomass and the microbial quotient in the top 0 - 5 cm of soil following the change from CC to DD or SI practice and with the change from SI to DD practice (P < 0. 05). Analysis of ester-linked fatty acid methyl esters (EL-FAMEs) extracted from the 0 - to 5 -cm and 5 - to 10 -cm layers of the soils of the various treatments detected changes in the FAME profiles following a change in <b>tillage</b> <b>practice.</b> A change from DD practice to SI or CC practice was associated with a significant decline in the ratio of fungal to bacterial fatty acids in the 0 - to 5 -cm soil (P < 0. 05).

5000|$|Vomitoxin, {{also known}} as {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpenoid. This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, {{both of which are}} important plant pathogens which cause fusarium head blight in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. A direct relationship between the incidence of fusarium head blight and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established. The incidence of fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, <b>tillage</b> <b>practices,</b> and fungicide use. [...] It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.|$|E
5000|$|Cultural {{controls}} help {{to delay}} the onset and development of symptoms, and reduce {{the level of the}} primary inoculum present. The primary inoculum that causes the onset of symptoms is induced by the production of microscopic spores called conidia in soil residue. Large amounts of peanut residue in fields where peanuts are cropped seasonally usually results in the progression of late leaf spot. Therefore, crop rotation, along with <b>tillage</b> <b>practices</b> are advised. Since longer periods of leaf wetness is required for disease development, frequent irrigation can increase the chances of high humidity and increased leaf wetness. [...] As opposed to irrigation systems, growers are encouraged to apply small amounts of water regularly in order to maintain a drier canopy. When planting new crops, plant as far away as possible, since late leaf spot spores travel far distances through wind dispersal. Try to avoid planting crops downwind from one another due to spore’s ability to travel between neighboring crop fields. Different varieties of peanut differ in their reaction to the pathogen, but none have proven to be resistant, and are able {{to be used as a}} control method. Spanish varieties are most susceptible, Virginia varieties are intermediates, and runner varieties are partially resistant. Very specific chemical controls are used to prevent yield loss, and are required in a very narrow, specific time period in order to be most effective. To be most successful, spray chemical controls as soon as the onset of symptom development. [...] Fungicide application is recommended on a 14-day set calendar schedule, or according to weather based leaf spot advisory. In fields that utilize crop rotation, fungicides should be sprayed during the early pod stage (R3), which typically occurs during July, but can vary according to environment. After the first spray, the grower should continue to apply fungicides every 14 days or according to the leaf spot advisory. Chlorothalonil (Bravo; various generic brands), are the most successful fungicides, and have reduced risk of host resistance. An alternative approach to calendar sprays are to spray crops based on weather patterns. However, this method has proven to be less effective than calendar treatment approaches. Following a harvesting season, growers should collect, burn, or bury the remains of the crops to prevent the soil-borne pathogen from surviving and causing future disease outbreaks.|$|E
