He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May. Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea at this point that the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E
25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding her arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in his workshop, while Andersen was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E

25|$|Vigilante groups, {{consisting}} of radical nationalists, and Neo-Nazis, lure men or boys to meetings, accuse them of being gay, humiliate and beat them, and post videos {{of the proceedings}} on social media. For example, in September 2013 a video showed the rape of an Uzbek migrant in Russia who was threatened {{with a gun and}} forced <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay. A few investigations were launched, but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution.|$|E
25|$|By this point, Andrew {{was also}} {{presenting}} {{six days a}} week – including cover shifts on the afternoon show, weekday evenings, The Friday Session, Saturday afternoons, and throughout the bank holiday schedules. On 14 July 2005, Andrew received a call <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> needed on-air as The Mailbox was being evacuated because of a bomb scare. Andrew found himself broadcasting late into the night on BBC WM with the then-editor Keith Beech arriving an hour later to co-present. It later transcribed that BBC Radio 5 Live had crossed to WM for rolling coverage.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, in an {{interview}} with bunkered.co.uk, Player branded as 'laughable' a report released by The R and USGA which said that driving distance in golf was only increasing minimally. He warned of a 'tsunami coming' due the governing bodies' failure to address issues surrounding new golf technology. After the 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, Player reiterated these comments, taking to Twitter <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 'sad' to see the Old Course at St Andrews 'brought to her knees' after Ross Fisher broke the course record on a day of very low scoring during the final round.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Star {{reported}} in November 2011 that SIS helped capture Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him {{along with his}} friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding {{out in the desert}} for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location. SIS agents using the £25million top-secret equipment closed in on him before calling in the Libyan snatch squad to apprehend him.|$|E
25|$|Starting in December 2010, Tunisian {{citizens}} began mass protesting against {{unemployment and}} Ben Ali's corruption. As mass protests grew, Ben Ali {{declared a state}} of emergency in the country, dissolved the government on 14 January 2011 and promised new legislative elections within six months. Later on that same day Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi went on state television <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> assuming power in Tunisia and said that the President had left the country. Ben Ali fled the country on 14 January at 4:00pm local time on a flight bound for Dubai and arrived in Saudi Arabia early on Saturday 15 January, where he was welcomed by Saudi authorities. The protests became known as the Tunisian Revolution.|$|E
25|$|At around 14:30 {{on the day}} of the murder, {{he called}} his wife <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to fill his {{motorcycle}} and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned Dnepr bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.|$|E

500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a cat. I {{think it would be}} fair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Michigan, Kaczynski {{specialized}} in complex analysis, specifically geometric function theory. His intellect and drive impressed his professors. [...] "He {{was an unusual}} person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth," [...] said professor Peter Duren. [...] "It is not enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smart," [...] said George Piranian, another of his Michigan math professors. During his time at Michigan, Kaczynski earned 5 B's and 12 A's in his 18 courses. However in 2006, he said his [...] "memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but got quite a few A's, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} after Feng Jianmei's story went public, the family {{suffered}} from what Zhang called [...] "state-backed harassment." [...] The harassment started when Deng Jiyuan attempted to go to Beijing to talk with a lawyer and do a television interview. Jiyuan's travel attempt was stopped by [...] "more than 100 people and a dozen cars," [...] according to Deng Jicai. [...] Then, [...] "a man suddenly appeared and kicked my brother in the stomach." [...] After Jiyuan was interviewed by Stern magazine on June 22, the harassment from the government became worse, with Jiyuan stating that he was subsequently followed by [...] "local officials and thugs" [...] everywhere he went, even the bathroom. He then disappeared from public sight on June 24, only phoning home on June 26 <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> safe, but his whereabouts remained unknown.|$|E
500|$|Miles {{was one of}} {{only three}} men (Hargest was one of the others) known to British Military Intelligence to have escaped from an Italian prisoner-of-war camp and make their way to another country prior to the {{armistice}} with Italy. In Switzerland, Miles and Hargest split up and travelled independently. As Hargest wrote in his book Farewell Campo 12, [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang up <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> off, and to suggest I should follow him later". Having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, exhausted and depressed, Miles shot himself. He was buried with military honours, and escorted to his final resting place in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery by members of the British Consulate and a party of Spanish officers. Shortly before his death, his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire was confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

500|$|The Observer (The Guardians sister paper) {{published}} {{an image of}} Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met Paul Lewis, a Guardian reporter who had worked on The Observer story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "extremely unhappy" [...] that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had {{to stay away from}} them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of [...] "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." [...] On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that {{there was nothing in the}} story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.|$|E
500|$|Hargest was {{transported to}} Italy {{where he was}} {{initially}} held in a villa near Sulmona but was transferred, along with a fellow New Zealander, Brigadier Reginald Miles, who had been captured in December 1941, to Castle Vincigliata, known as Campo 12, near Florence. Campo 12 was a prison camp for officers of general and brigadier rank and the prisoners were held under more comfortable conditions than soldiers of lesser rank. In late March 1943, a group of officers, including Hargest and Miles, managed to escape using a tunnel dug from a disused chapel within the castle walls. Of the six escapees, Hargest and Miles {{were the only two}} to reach safety in neutral Switzerland, where they split up to independently try to make their way to England. As Hargest later related [...] "I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang up <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> off, and to suggest I should follow him later". Miles made it to Figueras, close to the Spanish frontier, but, overcome with depression, killed himself on 20 October. With the help of the French Resistance, Hargest travelled through France to Spain, where he reached the British Consulate in Barcelona. He flew to England in December 1943.|$|E
500|$|In the story, SpongeBuck SquarePants takes a {{train to}} a town named Dead Eye Gulch. He goes to The Dead Eye Funeral and Ice Cream Parlor, and later to a western saloon called the Krusty Kantina. There he meets William Krabs (Mr. Krabs' ancestor), Hopalong Tentacles (Squidward's ancestor, a parody of Hopalong Cassidy) and Polene Puff (Mrs. Puff's ancestor). Later, Pecos Patrick Star (Patrick's ancestor, a parody of Pecos Bill), arrives and warns {{everybody}} that the town's villain, Dead Eye Plankton, will arrive and sing a song called [...] "Dead Eye". Dead Eye Plankton then arrives and challenges SpongeBuck to a duel at high noon. SpongeBuck gets kicked away to a desert, where he meets Pecos Patrick Star. Pecos Patrick tells SpongeBuck that he must smack Dead Eye Plankton several times to defeat him. When they get back into town, SpongeBuck meets Dead Eye Plankton and the two proceed to have a western duel. SpongeBuck then accidentally steps on Dead Eye, defeating him. The next scene shows William Krabs profiting by having the people of Dead Eye Gulch step on Dead Eye Plankton in exchange for one dollar. Eventually, the people build a golden statue of SpongeBuck to show their gratitude. SpongeBuck says that if he ever has a great-great-great-great-great-grandson, he wants him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proud of his grandfather.|$|E
