5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal.

However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks.

Sachs insightfully {{points out that}} it does not necessarily follow from the fact that profligate individuals increase the obligation of others <b>to</b> conserve <b>natural</b> resources, that those others can insist that the profligate individuals do their fair share. Sachs argues that this only follows if those who are obligated to pick up the slack have been wronged (Sachs, 2013, pp. 209). Furthermore, he argues that in order to be wronged, they must have been harmed (Sachs, 2013, p. 210). And since the obligation <b>to</b> conserve <b>natural</b> resources is, according to Sachs, not taken seriously, those who do not pick up the slack for others’ overuse are not being harmed. Therefore, Sachs concludes, my argument for indirect obligations <b>to</b> conserve <b>natural</b> resources for future people is on shaky ground...|$|R
