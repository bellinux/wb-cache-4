As a consequence, EU Directive 2009 / 128 /EC established a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, introducing “sustainability” as a political goal. The Directive obliges the Member States to draw up national action plans, “aimed at setting quantitative objectives, targets, measures, timetables, and indicators to reduce risks and impacts of pesticide use on {{human health and the environment}} and at encouraging the development and introduction of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques to reduce dependence on the use of pesticides […]” [28]. However, neither the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> nor the Directive proposed a precise quantitative reduction target for the application of PPPs. The European Commission, nevertheless, expected a significant reduction in PPP use as a result of the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> measures [27].|$|R

40|$|Soil {{protection}} {{has never}} ranked high among the priorities {{for environmental protection}} in Europe. Soils are commonly not well known by the European citizens, particularly since {{only a small fraction}} of the European population is currently living in rural areas and having a direct contact with soils. The majority of the urban population in Europe has only little understanding for the features and functions of soils. The most common perception is that soils are good dumping sites for all kinds of wastes and that soil can be quite useful as surfaces for building houses and infrastructure. Having more data and information about soils in Europe can help in improving this situation. The establishment of an European Soil Data Centre by the European Commission in support of the new EU <b>thematic</b> <b>strategy</b> for soil protection can certainly contribute to raising awareness in the general public of the importance of soil protection.

40|$|The {{integration}} of life cycle thinking into policy {{and decision making}} processes requires the development of credible and scientifically robust environmental indicators, capable to define targets and monitor results.

The US Soil Conservation Act, the German Federal Soil Protection Act, and the Soil Action Plan for England are just some examples of such policies. International policies for a sustainable use of soil resources have been developed both at regional level and at global level.

Further development of the EU <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> for Soil Protection will make it possible to explore new methods of international cooperation i this field. The recognition that soils are a limited resource and therefore need to be protected for the benefit of future generations was always {{at the top of the}} preoccupations of rural populations, particularly farmers.

40|$|Land, and in {{particular}} soil, is a finite and essentially non-renewable resource. Across the European Union, land take, i. e. the increase of settlement area over time, annually consumes more than 1000  km 2 of which half is actually sealed and hence lost under impermeable surfaces. Land take, and {{in particular}} soil sealing, has already been identified {{as one of the}} major soil threats in the 2006 European Commission Communication Towards a <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> on Soil Protection and the Soil <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> and has been confirmed as such in the report on the implementation of this strategy. The aim {{of this study is to}} relate the potential of land for a particular use in a given region with the actual land use. This allows evaluating whether land (especially the soil dimension) is used according to its (theoretical) potential. To this aim, the impact of several land cover flows related to urban development on soils with good, average, and poor production potentials were assessed and mapped. Thus, the amount and quality (potential for agricultural production) of arable land lost between the years 2000 and 2006 was identified. In addition, areas with high productivity potential around urban areas, indicating areas of potential future land use conflicts for Europe, were identified...|$|R
40|$|To {{support the}} European Commission {{in the review}} of the 2005 <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> on Air Pollution, this report revisits the {{baseline}} scenario that was presented in 2005 in view of today's knowledge, in particular taking into account the impacts of the economic crisis on economic and energy development, and real-life experience with newly implemented emission regulations. It compares the final baseline emission projection developed in 2005 within the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme for the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> on Air Pollution against the recent baseline projection prepared for the revision of the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> in 2012 (the TSAP- 2012 baseline). The report reviews the assumptions on main drivers of emission changes, i. e., demographic trends, economic growth, changes in the energy intensity of GDP, switches to other fuels, and application of dedicated emission control measures. For most of these drivers, reality has developed rather different compared to what has been assumed in 2005. In reality, SO 2 emissions in the old Member States in 2010 were 5 % lower than what was projected by CAFE. NH 3 was 10 % and VOC 3 % lower. NOx exceeded the CAFE projection by 7 %, and PM 2. 5 by 10 %. Larger differences occurred for the new Member States, where SO 2 was 30 % and NH 3 16 % below the levels suggest by CAFE. NOx was 11 % higher, and PM 2. 5 and VOC 21 % higher than estimated earlier. For 2020, the TSAP- 2012 baseline projection expects for the EU- 27 about 20 % less SO 2 emissions than the earlier CAFE baseline, with application of dedicated emission controls as the dominating factor for lower emissions. NOx would be 5 - 7 % lower, depending on the assumptions on the effectiveness of the new vehicle emission standards. The PM projection is about 10 % higher, while smaller differences emerge for VOC and NH 3. Many of these changes are smaller than differences in the actual drivers. In many cases, higher effectiveness of dedicated emission controls compensated the lower than expected decline in total energy consumption as well as the delay in the phase-out of coal. A re-analysis of air pollution control costs based on the actual statistics suggests for 2010 6 % higher costs earlier estimated, mainly due to higher consumption of coal that required more emission control efforts. For 2020, emissions of the new TSAP- 2012 baseline (without additional measures) are substantially higher than the indicative targets for emission reductions established by the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> in 2005. As a consequence, the environmental targets established by the TSAP for the protection of human health, eutrophication and forest acidification would not be met by the TSAP- 2012 baseline without additional measures...|$|R

40|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} is that desertification {{is linked}} to the presence of deserts. The truth is that desertification can and does occur far from any climatic desert, as {{the presence or absence of}} a nearby desert has no direct relation to desertification. Desertification is the result of human induced land degradation which can be accelerated under severe drought conditions, and can occur under very diverse climatic conditions. This is particularly the case for Europe, with extensive desertification processes occurring both in the Mediterranean and in the Central and Eastern European countries. Both areas have been recognized within the UNCCD as affected and are grouped within the convention under annex IV (Mediterranean) and annex V (Central and Eastern Europe) of UNCCD. Main desertification processes occurring in these areas are related to soil erosion, loss of soil organic carbon, contamination, salinisation, soil compaction, soil sealing, loss of soil biodiversity and landslides. These threats have been included in the recently adopted Soil <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> of the European Commission and will require urgent action in the near future in order to reverse the negative trends.
