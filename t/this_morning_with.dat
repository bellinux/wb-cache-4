25|$|After a {{few years}} of his US talk show being {{broadcast}} in the UK, ITV approached Springer who temporarily co-hosted <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>with</b> Judy Finnigan in March 1999 and again in 2000. In summer 1999, ITV made 12 episodes of the UK-based version of the series, Jerry Springer UK, filmed at the same studios as his US show.|$|E

25|$|The {{television}} series Alias prominently features the character Milo Rambaldi, a fictional prophet {{who seems to}} be an amalgam of Nostradamus and the non-prophetic but visionary inventor, artist, and genius Leonardo da Vinci. In the science fiction series First Wave, the protagonists use a previously unknown book of quatrains of Nostradamus to fight back against an alien invasion. Nostradamus was also a regular character on <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>With</b> Richard Not Judy, played by Emma Kennedy. Nostradamus appeared semi-regularly on the Warner Bros. animated series Histeria! as an eccentric red-bearded man in stereotypical wizard garb.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{broadcast}} of Katie: My Beautiful Friends, Piper appeared on a number of magazine and features programmes to discuss the series, in some cases accompanied by one of the ambassadors; these appearances included <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> (<b>with</b> Adele), The Vanessa Show (with Amitish), Fern (with Kayleigh), OK! TV and Loose Women (Piper alone). Piper also appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live with Chantelle as guests of Phil Williams (sitting in for Victoria Derbyshire), but prior to their going on air Chantelle was insulted by a security guard at the studios, an incident which was subsequently referred to by Williams on-air during the interview.|$|E
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E
500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E
500|$|The {{trigger for}} the Spice Girls' launch was {{the release of}} the [...] "Wannabe" [...] music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial {{resistance}} to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in Music Week, Top of the Pops, and Smash Hits, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise. A month after the video's release, the song was receiving intensive airplay on the main radio stations across the UK, while the group started to appear on television—mainly on kid's programmes such as Live & Kicking—and doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. A full-page advertisement appeared in the July issue of Smash Hits, saying: [...] "Wanted: Anyone with a sense of fun, freedom and adventure. Hold tight, get ready! Girl Power is comin' at you". The group appeared on the television programme <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>with</b> Richard and Judy, and performed at their first Radio One road show in Birmingham.|$|E

Caesar met me, as he was going on his errand <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>with</b> him I have laid the plan which, if {{executed}} as I wish, will save you--otherwise you are lost; and I again tell you, that no other power on earth, not even Washington, can save you." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{did some}} more washing {{in the lake}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and, <b>with</b> our clothes hung about on the dead trees and rocks, the shore looked like washing-day at home. The Indian, taking the hint, {{borrowed}} the soap, and, walking into the lake, washed his only cotton shirt on his person, then put on his pants and let it dry on him.|$|R
2500|$|The former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan once remarked of Tebbit: [...] "Heard a chap on {{the radio}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> talking <b>with</b> a cockney accent. They tell me {{he is one of}} Her Majesty's ministers". Peter Dorey of Cardiff University wrote that [...] "it was Norman Tebbit... who was perhaps the public face or voice of Essex Man, and {{articulated}} his views and prejudices".|$|R
2500|$|The {{shelling}} of the Zhabei District {{during the}} Shanghai Incident on 28 January 1932, resulted in over 600,000 Chinese refugees attempting {{to cross the}} Garden Bridge into the International Settlement. The Japanese military restricted access to the bridge for several weeks. By 20 February 1932, the approaches to [...] "the garden bridge into the foreign settlement again [...] glutted with a human" [...] tide of those [...] "writhing <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> the torch of war against her breast".|$|E
2500|$|David Beckham, who {{was then}} the England captain, scored the only goal of the match, a penalty kick {{following}} a foul on Michael Owen by Mauricio Pochettino, which many felt redeemed Beckham {{in the eyes of the}} English sporting public for his dismissal four years earlier. As The Times described it in their match report, [...] "vilified for the red card that helped to usher England out of the 1998 World Cup at the hands of Argentina, he wakes <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> his halo brighter than ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clemens {{reported}} the duel differently: [...] "They {{went out to}} fight <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>with</b> navy revolvers, at fifteen paces. The police interfered and prevented the duel." [...] Fitch, his wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law occupied a suite of rooms {{across the hall from}} Clemens and Dan DeQuille in the Dagget Building in Virginia City. Fitch started his own eight-page weekly literary journal, The Weekly Occidental, in which Clemens was very interested. Fitch planned to publish a novel in serial form, with successive weekly chapters contributed by Fitch, his wife Anna, J. T. Goodman, Dan De Quille, Rollin M. Daggett and Clemens. The Occidental was published from October 29, 1864 until April 15, 1865 but ceased publication before Twain could contribute.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} regained their apartments the lordly Keferinis soon appeared, {{to offer them}} his {{congratulations}} on their return. The minister was peculiarly refined and mysterious <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> especially <b>with</b> respect to the great event, which he involved in so much of obscurity, that, after much conversation, the travellers were as little acquainted with the occurrence as when they entered the courtyard of Gindarics.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well, then," [...] said Sir Piercie Shafton; [...] "we will dispute <b>this</b> matter to-morrow <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> our swords. Let {{the time}} be daybreak, and do thou assign the place. We will go forth {{as if to}} strike a deer." ...|$|R
60|$|April 20th.--The {{children}} found Houstonias {{more than}} a week ago. There have been easterly wind, continual cloudiness, and occasional rain for a week. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> opened <b>with</b> a great snow-storm from the northeast, one of the most earnest snow-storms of the year, though rather more moist than in midwinter. The earth is entirely covered. Now, as the day advances towards noon, it shows some symptoms of turning to rain.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 November 2015, a {{week after}} the attacks in Paris, French Minister Laurent Fabius visited New Delhi and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj. The talks {{centered}} around enhancing cooperation to fight terrorism, as well as preparations for the 2015 Climate summit in Paris. After the meeting Fabius stated that France and India were [...] "in the same boat" [...] with regards to terrorism saying, [...] "I want to say that France is grateful for tremendous support it has received from the international community including Indian friends ... We have a good cooperation with our Indian friends on this. I was discussion it <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> Prime Minister Modi. We shall develop our cooperation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1940, Guy Liddell, {{director}} of MI5's counterintelligence B Division, {{said that he}} had been told by an officer present at the interrogation that Scotland had punched the jaw of a captured German agent at MI5's secret interrogation centre, Camp 020. The agent was Wulf Schmidt, known by the code name [...] "Tate." [...] Liddell said in a diary entry that Scotland was [...] "hitting TATE in the jaw and I think got one back himself." [...] Liddell said: [...] "Apart from the moral aspects of the thing, I am convinced that these Gestapo methods do not pay in the long run." [...] Liddell said that [...] "Scotland turned up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> a syringe containing some drug or other, which it was thought would induce the prisoner [...] to speak." [...] Schmidt subsequently became a double agent against the Germans as part of the Double Cross System of double agents operated by MI5.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
5000|$|Graham Greene was {{a member}} and told his mother that once a term the club had a [...] "backwards day". He {{reported}} that after finishing with porridge [...] "we then returned backwards to Balliol... <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> started <b>with</b> bridge in dinner jackets". Evelyn Waugh, who had been at another college from 1922 to 1924, similarly recalled in A Little Learning that members [...] "put themselves to great discomfort by living a day in reverse".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here, woman,' he said, 'here's your {{deaf and}} dumb son. You may {{thank me for}} {{restoring}} him to you. He was brought before me, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> charged <b>with</b> theft; and with any other boy it would have gone hard, I assure you. But, as I had compassion on his infirmities, and thought he might have learnt no better, I have managed {{to bring him back}} to you. Take more care of him for the future.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I set {{out before}} daybreak <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on horseback <b>with</b> Honore Laine, {{who is a}} colonel in the Cuban army.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
