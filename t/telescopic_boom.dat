40|$|A {{high-resolution}} three-dimensional (3 D) seismic reflection {{system for}} small-scale targets in lacustrine settings has been developed. Its main characteristics include navigation and shot-triggering software that fires the seismic source at regular distance intervals (max. error of 0. 25 m) with real-time control on navigation using differential GPS (Global Positioning System). Receiver positions are accurately calculated (error < 0. 20 m) {{with the aid}} of GPS antennas attached to the end of each of three 24 -channel streamers. Two <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> hold the streamers at a distance of 7. 5 m from each other. With a receiver spacing of 2. 5 m, the bin dimension is 1. 25 m in inline and 3. 75 m in crossline direction. To test the system, we conducted a 3 D survey of about 1 km(2) in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, over a complex fault zone. A 5 -m shot spacing resulted in a nominal fold of 6. A double-chamber bubble-cancelling 15 / 15 in(3) air gun (40 - 650 Hz) operated at 80 bars and 1 m depth gave a signal penetration of 300 m below water bottom and a best vertical resolution of 1. 1 m. Processing followed a conventional scheme, but had to be adapted to the high sampling rates, and our unconventional navigation data needed conversion to industry standards.

40|$|A {{versatile}} mobile telerobot, denoted the magnetically attached multifunction maintenance rover (MAGMER), {{has been}} proposed {{for use in the}} inspection and maintenance of the surfaces of ships, tanks containing petrochemicals, and other large ferromagnetic structures. As its name suggests, this robot would utilize magnetic attraction to adhere to a structure. As it moved along the surface of the structure, the MAGMER would perform tasks that could include close-up visual inspection by use of video cameras, various sensors, and/or removal of paint by water-jet blasting, laser heating, or induction heating. The water-jet nozzles would be mounted coaxially within compressed-air-powered venturi nozzles that would collect the paint debris dislodged by the jets. The MAGMER would be deployed, powered, and controlled from a truck, to which it would be connected by hoses for water, compressed air, and collection of debris and by cables for electric power and communication (see Figure 1). The operation of the MAGMER on a typical large structure would necessitate the use of long cables and hoses, which can be heavy. To reduce the load of the hoses and cables on the MAGMER and thereby ensure its ability to adhere to vertical and overhanging surfaces, the hoses and cables would be paid out through <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> that would be parts of a MAGMER support system. The MAGMER would move by use of four motorized, steerable wheels, each of which would be mounted in an assembly that would include permanent magnets and four pole pieces (see Figure 2). The wheels would protrude from between the pole pieces by only about 3 mm, so that the gap between the pole pieces and the ferromagnetic surface would be just large enough to permit motion along the surface but not so large as to reduce the magnetic attraction excessively. In addition to the wheel assemblies, the MAGMER would include magnetic adherence enhancement fixtures, which would comprise arrays of permanent magnets and pole pieces that could be adjusted to maximize or minimize the overall attractive magnetic force. Even with a paint thickness of 2 mm, a preliminary design provides a safety factor of 5 in the magnetic force in the upside- down, water-jets-operating condition, in which the total load (including the weight of the MAGMER and cables and the water-jet force) would be about 260 lb (the weight of 118 kg). Optionally, the MAGMER could carry magnetic shielding and/or could be equipped with a demagnetizing module to remove residual magnetism from the structure. The MAGMER would carry four charge-coupled-device cameras for visual inspection, monitoring of operation, navigation, and avoidance of collisions with obstacles. The control system of the MAGMER would include navigation and collision-avoidance subsystems that would utilize surface features as landmarks, in addition to direct images of obstacles...|$|R

5000|$|On June 21, 2008, Kalitta was fatally injured {{during the}} final round of {{qualifying}} for the Lucas Oil NHRA SuperNationals at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park. [...] Kalitta's Funny Car was traveling at about 300 mph when the engine exploded in flames near the finish line. The parachutes were damaged and failed to slow the vehicle. According to the New Jersey State Police official news release evidence discovered in Kalitta’s lane revealed that he had applied mechanical braking and maintained steering control of the vehicle throughout the 2235-foot-long “shutdown” portion of the racetrack. Post-crash examination of the vehicle further revealed the clutch system to be locked, maintaining engine power to the rear wheels. Witnesses and audio recordings reveal the vehicle’s engine was firing throughout the shutdown portion of the racetrack, which further reinforced the fact that the vehicle’s engine was still providing power for some period of time. Kalitta's vehicle {{reached the end of the}} paved race track and went through a sand trap at around 125 mph. The vehicle went over the concrete retaining wall. The vehicle continued forward and impacted a piece of heavy equipment (JLG model 600S <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> lift vehicle), which was positioned outside the “run-off” area by the ESPN television crew. This impact caused catastrophic damage to the vehicle and additional separation of chassis components and the vehicle's engine.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Design of the mechanical components greatly depends on their expected structural performances. In modern design applications these performances are quantified by computer-based analysis and occasionally confirmed by experimental measurements or theoretical calculations. The dependency of the mechanical product to the structural analysis process is more significant under the product’s multi-functionality aspect that requires analyses {{for a variety of}} Variable Input Parameters, to obtain various structural responses and against more than one failure or design criterion. Structural analysis is known as the expert field, which requires an upfront investment and facilitation to be implemented in commercial design environment. On the other hand, the product design process is a systematic and sequential activity that put the designer in the central role of decision making. Lack of mutual understanding between these two disciplines reduces the efficiency of the structural analysis for design. This research aims to develop an integrated methodology to embed the structural analysis in the design process. The proposed methodology in this research combines the benefits of state-of-the-art approaches, early simulation and Validation and Verification practice, towards the specified aim. Moreover the novelty of the proposed methodology is in creative implication of Quality Function Deployment method to include the product’s multi-functionality aspect. The QFD-Based Design Integrated Structural Analysis methodology produces a reliable platform to increase the efficiency of the structural analysis process for product design purpose. The application of this methodology is examined through an industrial case-study for the <b>telescopic</b> cantilever <b>boom,</b> as it appears in Access platforms, and Cranes products. Findings of the case-study create a reliable account for the structural performance in early stages of the design, and ensure the functionality of the proposed methodology.

40|$|Gulfstream Aerospace {{has long}} been {{interested}} {{in the development of}} an economically viable supersonic business jet (SBJ). A design requirement for such an aircraft is the ability for unrestricted supersonic flight over land. Although independent studies continue to substantiate that a market for a SBJ exists, regulatory and public acceptance challenges still remain for supersonic operation over land. The largest technical barrier to achieving this goal is sonic boom attenuation. Gulfstream's attention has been focused on fundamental research into sonic boom suppression for several years. This research was conducted in partnership with the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) supersonic airframe cruise efficiency technical challenge. The Quiet Spike, a multi-stage <b>telescopic</b> nose <b>boom</b> and a Gulfstream-patented design (references 1 and 2), was developed to address the sonic boom attenuation challenge and validate the technical feasibility of a morphing fuselage. The Quiet Spike Flight Test Program represents a major step into supersonic technology development for sonic boom suppression. The Gulfstream Aerospace Quiet Spike was designed to reduce the sonic boom signature of the forward fuselage for an aircraft flying at supersonic speeds. In 2004, the Quiet Spike Flight Test Program was conceived by Gulfstream and NASA to demonstrate the feasibility of sonic boom mitigation and centered on the structural and mechanical viability of the translating test article design. Research testing of the Quiet Spike consisted of numerous ground and flight operations. Each step in the process had unique objectives, and involved numerous test team members from the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and Gulfstream Aerospace. Flight testing of the Quiet Spike was conducted at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center on an F- 15 B aircraft from August, 2006, to February, 2007. During this period, the Quiet Spike was flown at supersonic speeds up to Mach 1. 8 at the maximum design dynamic pressure of 685 pounds per square foot. Extension and retraction tests were conducted at speeds up to Mach 1. 4. The design of the Quiet Spike to shape the forward shock wave environment of the aircraft was confirmed during near-field shock wave probing at Mach 1. 4. Thirty-two flights were performed without incident and all project objectives were achieved. The success of the Quiet Spike Flight Test Program represents an important step towards developing commercial aircraft capable of supersonic flight over land within the continental United States and in international airspace...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives the}} {{introduction}} about {{the construction of}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> and different forces and moment acts on the different parts and area while picking up the load. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> is fitted on {{front end of the}} crane for lifting of load from different radius. More the distance of the load from the front axle of crane, less would be the load taking capacity. Accordingly boom of crane is designed. Here in this paper we shall consider one load case, i. e., when load lifted will be taken on the Jib Head...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this investigation, a {{modeling}} {{procedure of}} a <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> of cranes is developed using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation {{together with the}} sliding joint constraints. Since telescopic booms are extracted and retracted under various operating conditions, the overall length of the boom changes dynamically, leading to the time-variant vibration characteristics. For modeling the telescopic structure of booms, a special care needs to be exercised since {{the location of the}} sliding contact point moves along the deformable axis of the flexible boom and the solution to a moving boundary problem is required. This issue indeed makes the modeling of the <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> difficult, despite the significant needs for the analysis. It is, therefore, the objective of this investigation to develop a modeling procedure for the flexible <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> by considering the sliding contact condition with the dynamic frictional effect. To this end, the sliding joint constraint developed for the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is employed for describing relative sliding motion between flexible booms, while flexible booms are modeled using the beam element of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, which allows for modeling the large rotation and deformation of the structure...|$|E
40|$|The severe {{low-speed}} {{creep phenomenon}} {{occurs in the}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> system of a heavy-load transfer robot with a long <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> {{as a result of}} nonlinear friction. In order to improve control precision and operation performance at low speeds, we built a three-loop control nonlinear model of an AC servo motor with Stribeck friction disturbance. Traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) and fuzzy PID controls were, respectively, adopted in the position loop, and the control performance was simulated. The results showed that a system with fuzzy PID control eliminates “flat top” position tracking and “dead zone” speed tracking, which are generated by traditional PID, and thereby decreases the effect of friction on the performance of the servo system. This elimination also improved the tracking accuracy and robustness of the system...|$|E
