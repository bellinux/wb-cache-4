5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which led Marx <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict {{and to see the}} modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> {{a child of}} their own, Monica and Chandler discover that they are both infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of expectant single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much surprised when Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica's father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.|$|E

5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her {{as best she could}} about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> a child.|$|E
5|$|Last Night in Twisted River took 20 years <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> and write, {{and is a}} story {{within a}} story that shows the {{development}} of a novelist and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Awake was devised by Killen, who {{previously}} created the American television drama Lone Star for the Fox network.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of {{the supporters of}} SDI was one-time US presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power {{in light of the}} inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> {{children}} naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> {{of herself as a}} more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision that allowed him <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He {{used to say that}} he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> and seeking ART.|$|E

50|$|It is {{typically}} a legal mechanism applied {{in cases of}} divorce, separation or when parents do not live together; in contrast, a Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage is a marriage where the partners choose {{at the outset of}} the marriage (and prior <b>to</b> <b>conceiving</b> children) <b>to</b> share the work of child-raising, earning money, house chores and recreation time in nearly equal fashion across all four domains.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, it may be difficult <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{as a way}} {{to bring}} {{publicity}} to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> the possibility of quantum computers. In 1984–86, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able <b>to</b> <b>conceive</b> at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual {{maturity}} until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
