40|$|The {{current work}} {{examined}} the untested assumption that implicit self-esteem is nonconscious and cannot be assessed consciously. Participants completed measures of implicit and explicit self-esteem. Later, they guessed {{their level of}} implicit or unconscious self-esteem. Results indicated that participants were largely unable to assess consciously <b>their</b> implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> Estimations of implicit self-esteem were correlated moderately-strong with explicit self-esteem but negligibly with actual implicit self-esteem. These results indicate that implicit self-esteem is indeed nonconscious. In addition, participants high (vs. low) in explicit self-esteem more severely overestimated <b>their</b> implicit <b>self-esteem,</b> and participants low (vs. high) in implicit self-esteem seemed more uncertain about <b>their</b> implicit <b>self-esteem,</b> as indicated by a larger absolute difference between <b>their</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> and estimated implicit self-esteem. 74 Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis.

25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when <b>their</b> <b>self-esteem</b> is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|Corporal {{punishment}} is prohibited in schools {{but it is}} still widely practiced. Both students (34%) and teachers (25%) reported corporal punishment by teachers and parents against girls in school. Apart from corporal punishment, mainly older boys beat up girls to harass and degrade them or in retaliation for a refusal to initiate a sexual relationship. Male students might snatch girls' school materials, intimidate them and threaten to harm them as a way of forcing them into sexual relationships. Parents could take girls' property as a disciplinary measure. School teachers were reported to humiliate and verbally abuse girls in class and this was worse if the girl was attractive. In the school community, girls most frequently suffered verbal abuse aimed at undermining <b>their</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Other abuse involved touching private parts and punishment for refusing sexual requests. School girls might experience various forms of seduction before being subjected to sexually violent acts. This could be from school boys, teachers or rich sugar daddies who waited outside school gates.|$|E
25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect <b>their</b> <b>self-esteem</b> are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E

We conducted a three-wave panel study among 852 pre- and early adolescents (10 e 15 years old).

The study had focus on role that the teachers play in these aspects. The study was done by using both a qualitative and quantitative approach. The qualitative method was interviews based on six interviews with two teachers and four students from two different classes. The quantitative method was a questionnaire study that was done in both classes. Results from the study show that the students think that their high school teachers are promoting <b>their</b> mathematical <b>self-esteem.</b> The differences regarding students mathematical self-esteem are less than the differences found within the gender.

500|$|In 1997, {{researchers}} Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa {{observed that}} studies repeatedly showed that Japanese {{people do not}} seek to maintain and enhance <b>their</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> unlike Europeans and Americans. Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average, that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures, and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them, studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies. In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, {{the opposite of what}} was reported by Americans. All these studies involved participants being aware that <b>their</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem. This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead implicit self-esteem. [...] Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts. The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name. The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).|$|E

Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him, with Kirk referring to him as [...] "the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous."

They may employ defense mechanisms, including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a 'need to win', and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire.

[...] In communicative responses, women tend to use integrative communication, express negative affect, enhance their appearance, and use counterjealousy induction more often than jealous men. [...] Jealous men more often contact the rival, restrict the partner's access to potential rivals, and give gifts and spend money on the partner. [...] Jealous men also engage in dangerous behaviors, such as getting drunk and engaging in promiscuous sex with others. [...] Analysis from an evolutionary perspective would suggest that men focus on competing for mates and displaying resources (e.g., material goods to suggest financial security), while women focus on creating and enhancing social bonds and showcasing their beauty.|$|E
