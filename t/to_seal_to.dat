There are a few commodity plastics that have emerged as suitable for medical microfluidic applications. These include poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA), polystyrene, polycarbonate, and a variety of cyclic polyolefin materials. PMMA has good optical properties for fluorescence, and UV detection modes are relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> themselves. These are available in grades suitable for both injection and compression molding. Polystyrene is a material known for assay development. Polycarbonates have a high glass transition temperature but poor optical properties for fluorescent detection. The cyclic polyolefins appear to have the best combination of optical and mechanical properties.|$|E
50|$|A {{vacuum bag}} is a {{bag made of}} strong rubber-coated fabric or a polymer film used to {{compress}} the part during cure or hardening. In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a mold is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> {{the outer edge of}} the mold face.When using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a vacuum pump. As a result, uniform pressure approaching one atmosphere is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the adhesive cures. The entire bag may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.|$|E

50|$|Schjeldahl {{began his}} career at Armour and Company, where he began working with polyethylene. Unable to get the {{material}} <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> itself, {{he and his wife}} experimented on solutions at home, where they developed a hot knife-sealing process. He left Armour in 1946 and moved to Minneapolis, where he created a bag-making machine in his home. He used the machine to launch his first company, Herb-Shelly, Inc., in 1948. The company moved into a shop the next year in Farmington, Minnesota, and eventually produced a variety of polyethylene packaging materials and plastic bag liners. By 1954, the company had $500,000 annual sales and 100 employees. The company started experimenting with lamination at this time, researching adhesives for a new DuPont polymer called Mylar. The company was also involved in the fabrication of a balloon for the Office of Naval Research at the University of Minnesota. In May 1954, Herb-Shelly was acquired by Brown & Bigelow. Schjeldahl resigned and left the company on January 8 1955.|$|E
50|$|The {{turning point}} in the season was the {{dramatic}} fixture in Round 16 where Wolves FC met Bayside United at Carmichael Park. Bayside came into the fixture in second place on the ladder looking to consolidate their aspirations for promotion, whilst Wolves FC were in the relegation zone in 11th position. In the 13th minute of the match, Wolves FC forward Antonio Murray was forced to be replaced after a challenge left him with a fractured leg. Wolves FC forward Michael Bell scored in the 25th minute to give the Wolves the lead 1-0. However, in the 45th minute, another challenge saw Michael Bell leave the field in an ambulance with a broken leg. Following the half time resumption, two Wolves players were given red cards by the referee, leaving the Wolves with only nine men with twenty minutes still to play. Stoic defense followed, with it looking like the Wolves would hold on <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> victory. With minutes remaining, Bayside were awarded a penalty which gave them an opportunity to snatch a draw. However Wolves keeper Douglas Blaikie blocked the penalty with a diving save to his right, which was then cleared by the desperate Wolves FC defenders. Wolves FC won the match 1-0.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explains}} Minnesota’s expungement law and analyzes {{a recent}} Minnesota Court of Appeals decision that limits the expungement remedy. Specifically, this article begins {{by examining the}} effects of a criminal record and the purposes of expungement. 8 An expungement’s main purpose is to seal an individual’s criminal record from public view, thereby allowing the individual to fully reintegrate into society. This article then provides an overview of current expungement law and its history. This article also explains different types of criminal records and the different mechanisms used to seal each type of record. The focus of this article is on sealing records of convictions. One of the difficulties in sealing a criminal record is in the number of public and private agencies that have a record of the offense. In the past, a court could order all public agencies holding a record of the offense to seal the record. But under recent case law, specifically State v. Schultz, the Minnesota Court of Appeals found that, under the separation of powers doctrine, district courts only have the authority to seal judicial records. This finding leaves executive branch records available to the public. One example of an executive record is the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) record, which is of particular concern because many landlords and employers use BCA records to conduct background checks on applicants. Limiting the district court’s power <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> judicial records nullifies the expungement remedy and creates an inconsistency in records not contemplated by the court of appeals. Keeping executive branch records available to the public also ignores legislative intent and the practical realities of the separation of powers doctrine. Lastly, in response to the Schultz decision, this article offers some tools that could help defense attorneys avoid the Schultz holding...|$|E
40|$|In {{phase one}} of this project, Mr. Dubose needed {{assistance}} to evaluate his Minimal Crevice Volume (MCV) Piston Ring concept {{to see if it}} showed enough technical merit to warrant the expenditure of time and money into patenting the concept and commercializing it. He initially enlisted the help of Texas Tech University, and subsequently Honeywell FM and T, to evaluate the concept for technical feasibility. This evaluation included engineering evaluations of the concept's functionality and manufacturability, along with design analysis and refinement through finite element analysis and other methods. The Principal Investigator at FM and T (Greg Schuttler) and Dr. Maxwell at Texas Tech provided feedback to Mr. Dubose on the functional feasibility of the concept, and the Principal Investigator at FM and T provided manufacturability guidance. Dr. Maxwell had engineering students and a graduate student at Texas Tech conduct static finite element studies to further evaluate the concept; and an extensive dynamic finite element evaluation of the concept, including design refinement, was carried out at FM and T by the Principal Investigator and Jim Mahoney. The results of the FM and T finite element analysis were used as a justification for Mr. Dubose to pursue patent application for this concept. The dynamic finite element study pushed the state-of-the-art for this type of study at FM and T. It also served as a vehicle to facilitate the familiarization of FM and T associates outside the Finite Elements group in Engineering with finite element techniques and capabilities, a plant goal. In phase two of this project, Mr. Dubose was attempting to prove the viability of his already patented ''Variable Orbital Aperture'' concept. All three of the major US automotive corporations had expressed an interest in Mr. Dubose's multiple valve disc concept, if it could be proven that an effective sealing method could be found, since rotary valve engines have historically been nearly impossible <b>to</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish this, Mr. Dubose proposed to build a functional single-disc cylinder head to try different seal designs. Texas Tech had a Kawasaki single cylinder engine that was suitable for this use, and it was decided that a rotary valve cylinder head would be fabricated to fit this engine. To this end, Texas Tech provided assistance in creating the cylinder head design, assisted by Honeywell FM and T. Several design iterations were created, and both wax and stereolithography models were created at FM and T to assist the design process. The wax and stereolithography models were used for conceptual visualization of the designs, fit-up checks of the various components with the actual engine, and even flow testing of the intake and exhaust ports. When the design was finalized, two prototype cylinder head assemblies were machined, from aluminum and steel supplied by Texas Tech and Mr. Dubose, in the FM and T Model Shop. The engine was then to be assembled and tested at Texas Tech. At the time that this project was closed, the engine had not yet been completely assembled and tested...|$|E
