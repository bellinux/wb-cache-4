5|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{this bird}} breeds from April to August. In east Africa, <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season {{is at least}} from January to February, while in {{southern}} Africa, <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season is from October to April.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are {{predominantly}} monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season.|$|E

5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season {{immediately}} following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season, and fledge more young. As <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|In {{polygynous}} {{species with}} considerable sexual dimorphism, males tend to return earlier to <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> sites than their females. This is termed protandry.|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. <b>The</b> <b>breeding</b> males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by avian diseases, with <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in {{woodlands}} near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. <b>The</b> <b>breeding</b> season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India {{begins with the}} onset of monsoons in May. <b>The</b> <b>breeding</b> season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season.

The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} is migratory, {{spending}} {{the northern hemisphere}} winter mainly in cool waters off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, south to latitude 38°S and east to KwaZulu-Natal. Some birds stay north of the equator in the seas adjoining Mauritania and Rio de Oro, and a few remain near <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> islands, especially in the Mediterranean. It is strictly oceanic outside <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> season, although it is described as regularly seen from land in West Africa. Young birds do not return to <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> colonies until their second or third year. Birds mostly head south from <b>the</b> <b>breeding</b> islands between September and November, reaching West Africa by mid-November and the south Atlantic {{by the end of}} the year.

The album is dedicated to Ralph B. Prater, who committed suicide in March 2011. It is a reminder that for every one person who makes it out alive, more will die of heartbreak.|$|R
