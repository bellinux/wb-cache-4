25|$|Green took a {{managerial}} {{interest in}} Boilerhouse but Stevens and Terrey {{were not prepared}} to turn professional at the time, so Green put an advert in the Melody Maker to find another rhythm section to back Kirwan. Over 300 applicants replied but after several auditions, none was deemed good enough to replace the pair by the hard to please Green, so another solution was found. Fleetwood Mac had been constituted as a quartet, but Green {{had been looking for}} another guitarist <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the workload, in view of slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer's unwillingness to contribute much to Green's songs. Drummer Mick Fleetwood, previously a member of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, suggested to Green that Kirwan could join Fleetwood Mac, and although neither Green, bassist John McVie (both also former Bluesbreakers), nor Spencer were entirely convinced, Fleetwood asked Kirwan to join the band in August 1968. Kirwan's arrival expanded Fleetwood Mac to a five-piece with three guitarists. He played his first gig with the band on 14 August at the Nag's Head Blue Horizon Club in Battersea, London.|$|E

500|$|The {{content of}} hatt-ı hümayuns tends {{to reflect the}} power {{struggle}} that existed between the Sultan and his council of viziers (the Divan). The process of using the hatt-ı hümayun to authorize {{the actions of the}} grand vizier came into existence in the reign of Murad III. This led to a loss of authority and independence in the grand vizier while other palace people such as the Master of the Harem (Harem Ağası) or concubines (cariye) who had greater access to the Sultan gained in influence. By giving detailed instructions or advice, the Sultans reduced the role of the grand viziers to be just a supervisor to the execution of his commands. This situation appears to have created some backlash, as during most of the 17th century there were attempts to return to grand viziers' prestige and the power of [...] "supreme proxy" [...] (vekil-i mutlak) and over time hatt-ı hümayuns returned to their former simplicity. However, in the eighteenth century, Selim III became concerned by the over-centralization of the bureaucracy and its general inefficacy. He created consulting bodies (meclis-i meşveret) <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the authority with him and the grand vizier. He would give detailed answers on hatt-ı hümayuns to questions asked of him and would make inquiries as to whether his decisions were followed. The hatt-ı hümayun became Selim III's tool to ensure rapid and precise execution of his decisions.|$|E

2500|$|By 1940 multisection tubes {{had become}} commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other {{licensing}} considerations (see British Valve Association).
