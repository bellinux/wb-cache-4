5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of <b>this</b> <b>photograph.</b> It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|The {{dining hall}} {{contains}} {{one of the}} largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass howitzer shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during World War I and then converted into a gong. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as Little Lightning Oak this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of Terrace, the promenade visible in <b>this</b> <b>photograph.</b> This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed but re-sprouted.|$|E
25|$|Picasso's Landscape with Two Figures {{is almost}} entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its {{reduction}} to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in <b>this</b> <b>photograph.</b> Its quasi-Nabis post-Symbolist treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all depth of field. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects {{in front of others}} obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds with her right hand.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, on December 7, Webb engaged two hobbyists, Edgar Van Horn and Ernest Howatt, to {{photograph}} the carcass for posterity. At least two photographs were taken, one of the lateral view {{and one of the}} anterior view, showing the apparent arm stumps. The latter also included a man, likely DeWitt Webb himself, for scale. As the images were over-exposed, they were never published. These photographs were for a long time considered lost, and only drawings based on them, made by Alpheus Hyatt Verrill and published in the American Naturalist of April 1897, were known. However, one of the original images, showing the lateral view, was obtained by Gary Mangiacopra in 1994. It is clear that one of Verrill's drawings was based on <b>this</b> <b>photograph.</b> A simplified drawing of this image also appeared in the Hartford Daily Running of February 18, 1897.|$|E

500|$|Liddell {{also claimed}} that the {{prominent}} occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated {{into one of these}} nine covens as a young man. According to this account, Crowley had been introduced to the coven in 1899 or 1900 by his magical mentor, Allan Bennett. Liddell asserted that Crowley was subsequently ejected from the coven for his misbehaviour. As evidence for these claims, he stated that his own grandfather had been present on three occasions at which Bennett and Crowley met with Pickingill, and that he had seen a photograph in which the three figures are together. When asked to present <b>this</b> <b>photograph</b> for public scrutiny in 1977, Liddell claimed that it was [...] "not available"; when independently asked again in 1983, he asserted that it had been stolen by [...] "interested parties".|$|E
500|$|Fark {{was created}} in 1999 by Drew Curtis of Lexington, Kentucky. Curtis states that the word [...] "fark" [...] {{originated}} either from a chat room euphemism for a popular four letter F-word, or from a drunken misspelling, although he tells people it is the former {{because it is a}} [...] "better story that way". He registered Fark.com in September 1997, when a friend mentioned that all of the four letter domain names were disappearing. Originally, Fark contained no content except for an image of a squirrel with large testicles. <b>This</b> <b>photograph</b> is that of a Cape Ground Squirrel in Etosha National Park, Namibia, taken by photographer Kevin Shafer, who at the time worked for the Corbis Corporation, ca. 1993. The squirrel image is no longer used in the production area of the site, but it can still be found as the server's 404 error for pages that do not exist.|$|E
500|$|The cover art to Vespertine [...] {{explores the}} theme of {{personal}} identity through visual means: hence Björk is featured in black and white, shading her eyes, lips slightly parted in an unmistakably erotic pose. For {{the first time in}} this context, however, she does not meet the viewer's gaze directly. Instead, the superimposed image of a swan provides a protective shield between Björk and the viewer. Both <b>this</b> <b>photograph</b> and Björk's subsequent appearances at promotional events dressed as a swan metonymically evokes not only the mythic figure of Leda, but more particularly the familiar legend in which she exchanges her husband, the Spartan king Tyndareus, for the God Zeus when he approaches her in disguised form. As in other visual representations of this myth, the entwined bodies of Leda and the swan permit a representation of erotic intimacy that would prove unacceptable if realised in a more literal fashion.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the Record Plant Studio and working on Ono's song [...] "Walking on Thin Ice". When they {{returned}} to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. [...] "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" [...] was released as a single {{less than a month}} later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining major underground airplay. In 1981, she released the album Season of Glass, which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. <b>This</b> <b>photograph</b> sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the liner notes to Season of Glass, Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because [...] "he would have been offended—he was one of us." [...] The album received highly favorable reviews and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of <b>this</b> <b>photograph</b> for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E
500|$|The {{use of a}} {{pregnant}} sex symbol was in a sense an attempt to combat the pop culture representations of the anathema of the awkward, uncomfortable, and grotesquely excessive female form {{in a culture that}} values thinness. Leibovitz' candid portrayal drew a wide spectrum of responses from television, radio and newspaper personalities and the public at large ranging from complaints of sexual objectification to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of empowerment. One of the judges in Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp. stated that the image evoked Botticelli's Birth of Venus. [...] The contemporary retrospective view of some is that <b>this</b> <b>photograph</b> is [...] "high art". The intent of the photograph was to portray pregnancy with a celebrity {{in a way that was}} bold, proud and understated in a [...] "anti-Hollywood, anti-glitz" [...] manner. It was successful in some regards as many perceived it as a statement of beauty and pride. However, many took offense and the cover drew unusually intense controversy for Vanity Fair in the form of ninety-five television spots, sixty-four radio shows, 1,500 newspaper articles and a dozen cartoons. Some stores and newsstands refused to carry the August issue, while others modestly concealed it in the wrapper evocative of porn magazines.|$|E
