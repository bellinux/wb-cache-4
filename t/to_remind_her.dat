5|$|Later Sunday morning, Fred Murray {{learned the}} damage to his vehicle would be covered by his auto insurance. He rented a car, dropped Murray off at the university, and {{departed}} for Connecticut. At 11:30 that night, Fred Murray called his daughter Maura <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> to obtain accident forms from the Registry of Motor Vehicles. They agreed to talk again Monday night to discuss the forms and fill out the insurance claim via phone.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

He went to bed as he had to get up early the next morning for work.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th {{century the}} teachings of Luo {{combined}} with other folk beliefs, namely Maitreyan millenarianism and the folk mother goddess. In the new mythological representation of Luo's enlightenment, humans are children of the primordial goddess. Confused by the desires of the material world, they have forgotten their celestial origin, and so the Mother sends emissaries <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> children the possibility of return to the original condition in the Three Suns, or stages of the world. The three enlightened beings are Dipankara, Gautama and Maitreya the future one.|$|E
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E

25|$|Yum-Yum {{is being}} {{prepared}} by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses {{on her own}} beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> of the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising {{to present to the}} Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ron Weasley {{receives}} a Howler from his mother, Molly Weasley, after he steals his father's enchanted car and flies it to Hogwarts with Harry.

Subsequently, Neville {{receives a}}nother Howler from his grandmother after Sirius Black uses his list of passwords to enter the Gryffindor Common Room in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

50|$|Spider-Man {{ran into}} the Black Cat as she was {{breaking}} into the penthouse apartment of Dexter Bennett.

She and Puma had ended their relationship, so she and Spider-Man share a kiss, and later they slept together with the lights off, so Felicia could not see Peter's face. Following this encounter Peter and Felicia begin a sexual relationship. Peter later enlists the Black Cat's help in getting back his vial of blood from Mister Negative.|$|R

500|$|... "Remember December" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Demi Lovato for her second studio album, Here We Go Again. It was written by John Fields, Lovato and Anne Preven, and produced by Fields. The song was released in Europe as the album's second and final single on January 18, 2010 through Hollywood Records. [...] "Remember December" [...] adapts power pop and synthpop genres and diverges from Lovato's usual pop rock sound. The lyrics describe the protagonist's attempt <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend of the good times of their relationship. Lovato described the song's sound {{as an example of}} what she wanted her future music to sound like.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, the financially {{strapped}} author Pamela [...] "P. L." [...] Travers reluctantly travels {{from her home}} in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would do to her character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations—no animation and unprecedented script approval—before she agrees to go.|$|E
500|$|Manish Malhotra and Vikram Phadnis {{designed}} the costumes and the cinematography was handled by Ravi Yadav. The film was mainly shot in Cape Town, Goa, Pune and Mumbai. Chopra, who was simultaneously filming four other productions, revealed {{that because of}} her busy schedule the producers of her other films had to move their sets to the Filmistan Studio, where Aitraaz was being made. She wept during filming of the sexual-harassment scene; it took the directors several hours <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> she was only playing a character, and further filming was postponed. The music video of the title track [...] "Aitraaz– I Want to Make Love to You" [...] with Kumar and Chopra was shot in one take with a Steadicam.

500|$|In her Life, {{she wrote}} that she taught {{herself from the}} {{instructions}} given in the book, The Third Spiritual Alphabet - by Francisco de Osuna - which relates to Franciscan mysticism. Her starting point was the practice of [...] "recollection", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In The Way of Perfection she wrote: [...] "It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God". She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.|$|E
500|$|Anne's sole {{surviving}} child, the Duke of Gloucester, {{died at the}} age {{of eleven}} on 30 July 1700. She and her husband were [...] "overwhelmed with grief". Anne ordered her household to observe a day of mourning every year on the anniversary of his death. With William childless and Gloucester dead, Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth, who was the sister of Anne's grandfather Charles I. Over fifty Catholics with stronger claims were excluded from the line of succession. Anne's father died in September 1701. His widow, Anne's stepmother, the former queen, wrote to Anne to inform her that her father forgave her and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> of her promise to seek the restoration of his line. Anne, however, had already acquiesced to the new line of succession created by the Act of Settlement.|$|E
500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out doing wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E

50|$|For the First Time {{follows the}} lives of a couple from two worlds. Seth (Richard Gutierrez) is a rich, {{impulsive}} playboy who runs away from serious relationships and doesn’t give much thought to the women he goes out with.

6000|$|And {{that reminds}} me that Mrs Bowater proved {{to have been a}} good prophet. It was one day at luncheon. Mrs Monnerie {{happened}} to cast a glance at the Morning Post newspaper which lay open on a chair near by, showing in tall type {{at the top of the}} column, [...] "Sudden Death of Sir Jasper Goodge." [...] Sir Jasper Goodge, whose family history, it seemed, was an open book <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> whimsically of another tragedy. She put back her head and, surveying me blandly as I sat up beside her, inquired if I had known at all intimately that unfortunate young man, Mr Crimble.|$|R
2500|$|Mélusine {{is alone}} in an {{underground}} chamber in her château where she practices her magic and consults various {{books of the}} occult.

At that moment one of the walls in her chamber collapses and Stello appears very much alive <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> that she cannot escape from their pact.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was educated}} by tutors {{at home and}} wrote that she {{understood}} very little Russian as a child because her family spoke French. As a young girl, she enjoyed listening to folk stories of old Russia told by her maternal grandmother and her childhood nurse. [...] "The peasants at Revovka were extremely superstitious, and they believed implicitly in witches and warlocks," [...] wrote Dehn. Later, she had an English governess. She loved her childhood estate and, whenever she went to visit an uncle in Livadiya, took a bit of dirt with her from Revovka <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> of home.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, on Day 40, Channel 4 {{confirmed}} that Charley {{had been called}} to the Diary Room and reprimanded after using the word [...] "nigger" [...] twice on one night. This was not broadcast on the nightly highlights programme or the live feed, further inflaming rumours about favouritism towards Charley. A Big Brother spokesperson claimed [...] "Charley used the N-word as a black woman to refer to another black person. We judged her {{use of the term}} different from Emily's. But Big Brother called her to the Diary Room <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>her</b> that this word could cause offence." ...|$|E
60|$|Lily had exacted {{a promise}} {{from her mother}} before her illness, and {{during the period of}} her {{convalescence}} often referred <b>to</b> it, <b>reminding</b> <b>her</b> mother that that promise had been made, and must be kept.
