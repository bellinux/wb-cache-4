The area is rich in history, this is the Big Muddy Badlands area which featured the hideouts of outlaws and rum runners of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century. [...] This area remained above the Quaternary age ice sheets, being pushed and folded by the glacier movement resulting in glaciotectonic hills. [...] The highway winds up, down and around these hills along the way. The Big Muddy Badlands are within the Missouri Coteau. [...] At km 12.2 the highway reaches Kildeer, and the intersection with Highway 18. Access to Wood Mountain Post Provincial Historical Park is obtained by following Highway 18 north for [...] This section of Highway 2 begins as a Class 4 highway and is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SHT) South West Transportation Planning Council. [...] The highway is a secondary weight highway with a thin membrane surface type as it only has an average of 390 vehicles per day (vpd) according to the 2007 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) count which was taken north of Rockglen. [...] Highway 2 begins a concurrency with Highway 18 in a northeasterly direction. [...] Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures, hay and fodder crops and spring wheat are the main crops in Old Post rural municipality (RM). [...] There is a point of information at km 42.3. [...] This area is known as the Wood Mountain Uplands where there are mining endeavours undertaken such as coal, bentonite, kaolinitic and ceramic clays. [...] Paleontological digs have uncovered a 63-million-year-old sea turtle which has been excavated in the Killdeer region. Rockglen is located at km 49.7, and Highway 2 now extends in a northerly direction again. Rockglen (Population 450 in 2001 and 360 in 2006 [...] ) and Assiniboia ( [...] 2,483 in 2001 and 2,305 in 2006 [...] ) are the two largest centers between the border and the city of Moose Jaw. [...] This geographical region of Highway 2 from Rockglen to Assiniboia has been upgraded to a Class 3 highway as it carries approximately 800 vehicles per day counted to the south of Assiniboia. [...] Therefore, the surface type before Assiniboia is a granular road surface which is a structural pavement with a hot mix surface coating. The highway type, surface, maintenance and construction projects are looked after by the SHS South Central <b>Traffic</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. [...] Fife Lake is located to the north east of the highway. The St. Victor Petroglyph Historic Park is located just to the west of Highway 2 by [...] These unique petroglyph features carved into the sandstone are slowly disappearing. [...] At [...] is the town of Assiniboia where 1,260 vpd results in the highway designated as an asphalt concrete (AS) Class 2 primary weight highway all the way to Moose Jaw. [...] Junction with Highway 13, the Redcoat Trail occurs at km 106.4, providing access to Lafleche. [...] Vantage is located to the west of the highway along this stretch, with access provided at km 129.2. [...] Mossbank is located at the intersection with Highway 718. Here is the southeast portion of Old Wives Lake, which is a part of the Chaplin, Old Wives Lake, Reed Lakes (Hemispheric) - Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) Site, a designated Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network, protecting three saline lakes, saline and freshwater marshes. Ardill is located near the northern extremity of Lake of the Rivers. Highway 36 is located at km 176.4, which provides access to Crestwynd, and the Jean Louis Legare Regional Park.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} facing urban planners and designers {{in the city}} of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is planning the movement of vehicles and mass transit during the period of Hajj (Islamic Pilgrimage) when a huge number of people {{come from all over the}} world for religious activities. Every year, local authorities need to provide a <b>traffic</b> awareness <b>plan</b> that can be implemented during Hajj to avoid traffic congestion. A traditional means to distribute awareness of the <b>traffic</b> <b>plan</b> is to publish hard copy maps and distribute them to local authorities and the public before each Hajj season. This method requires extensive time and resources. This paper demonstrates how the web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) can be utilized to provide broader and easier distribution of the <b>traffic</b> <b>plan.</b> Such a system will facilitate understanding and ease the following of the <b>traffic</b> <b>plan.</b> Awareness of the plan will help implementation and reduce traffic congestion due to unawareness.

Depending on {{the density of}} traffic (occupancy) and the dominant direction of traffic (for example, inbound, outbound, or bidirectional) on a road, nearby signalised intersections are operated using several predefined <b>traffic</b> <b>plans.</b> A user sets up the signal timing, and picks the traffic density levels and direction that they apply to. Selecting the appropriate signal timing is then automatic. When a time based <b>traffic</b> <b>plan</b> schedule would be inappropriate because of varying traffic levels, STREAMS® Dynamic Plan Selection can adapt to unexpected traffic levels as they arise.|$|R

40|$|The {{traffic signal}} {{is one of}} the most common control devices used to manage highway traffic. Operating them as {{isolated}} units does not exploit their usefulness fully. An advanced system, in which traffic signals at junctions at a close proximity are coordinated, enables a more efficient method of traffic control. This thesis presents the development of hardware and software for the Uniroad traffic signal controller, for interfacing it to the proposed Advanced Traffic Control System (A TCS) for Sri Lanka, and a technique to calculate <b>traffic</b> <b>plans</b> based on the Genetic Algorithm for the coordinated system. In hardware development, a communication interface and a general purpose input interface (GPIT) are designed and implemented for the traffic signal controller (TSC). These are used to monitor the performance and change <b>traffic</b> <b>plans</b> manually or through computer control. The GPII is also used to interface vehicle detectors, pedestrian pushbutton etc. to the TSC. The firmware platform of the TSC is developed to accommodate the requirements of both coordinated as well as individual systems. Synchronizing routines, temporary overrides and online time plan adjustments as well as error detecting and logging routines are introduced. A control and monitoring (C&M) software package is developed for the control center. Using this package, the operation of each traffic signal controller can be monitored or optimally adjusted as needed. A <b>traffic</b> <b>plan</b> calculator (TPC) is developed to calculate <b>traffic</b> <b>plans</b> needed for a set of coordinated traffic signal controllers. A new algorithm, based on well-known evolutionary algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, was developed for TPC. The TPC provides an optimum set of <b>traffic</b> signal <b>plans</b> for a coordinated traffic signal system. This is a one requirement of proposed Advanced traffic Control System for Sri Lanka.
