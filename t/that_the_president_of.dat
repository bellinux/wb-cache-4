He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, so much so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state {{constitution}} specified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council's primary {{function}} was judicial, {{but it also}} acted as a body of advisers to the king {{and as a result}} its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E
50|$|The {{influence}} of the main political parties and party leaders is enormous. Many experts estimate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main parties are considerably more powerful than both ordinary ministers and the entire Parliament.

25|$|Article VII Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution {{explicitly}} states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> the Philippines {{can only}} serve for one term.

Although Arroyo fell under this category, she initially announced on December 30, 2002 that she would not seek the presidency in 2004. She emphasized that she would devote her remaining months in office to serving the people and improving the economy of the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{employed}} part of {{the fleet}} during the 2008 Georgian conflict. Russian units operating off Georgia's separatist Abkhazia region resulted in a reported skirmish with the Georgian Navy unconfirmed by Georgia. As a result, Ukraine's then President Viktor Yushchenko decreed that the Black Sea Fleet would henceforth need permission to cross the Ukrainian border to enter and leave to Sevastopol, to which a Russian admiral retorted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Federation and not Ukraine commands the Black Sea Fleet. Yushchenko's decrees were without force and deployed units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet returned to their home moorings without incident.|$|E
25|$|The President of Finland is {{the grand}} {{master of the}} Order of the White Rose. According to the protocol, the {{president}} shall wear the Grand Cross of the White Rose with collar on formal occasions. The original design of the collar, decorated with 9 swastikas, dates from 1918, and was designed by the artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president Urho Kekkonen in 1963 after it became known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> France Charles De Gaulle was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.|$|E
25|$|Japan v.

In 1962, MITI banned Fairchild from further investments in the factory that they already purchased in Japan, and Noyce tried to enter the Japanese market through the corporation NEC. In 1963, the management of NEC pushed Fairchild to extremely advantageous for Japan licensing terms, strongly limiting the Fairchild sales in the Japanese market. Only after concluding the deal Noyce learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> NEC also chaired the MITI committee that blocked the Fairchild deals.|$|E

It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor Romano Prodi approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company. It also became known that Peter Mandelson, then the British EU Commissioner, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a change}} of {{government}} in October 1993, the incoming Liberal Party ordered the immediate cancellation of the order, forcing the payment of C$500 million of cancellation fees. By not purchasing the helicopters and slashing the DND budget, the government aimed to trim the deficit and be more fiscally responsible. As a negative, the Liberal government left itself with little maneuvering room as the Sea King fleet continued to age and its systems become obsolete; a replacement was needed but no alternative or contingency plan had been made. Some commentators observed that cancelling the NSA contract was not a fiscally responsible move. During one debate, Chrétien famously retorted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the United States still flew in a Sea King, thus the helicopter was also good enough for Canada.|$|E
