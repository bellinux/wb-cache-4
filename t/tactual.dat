[Footnote 67: Locke {{answered}} {{that the man}} would not distinguish the cube from the sphere, until he had identified by actual touch {{the source of his}} former <b>tactual</b> impression with the object making a given visual impression. Condillac, while making just objections to the terms in which Molyneux propounded the question, answered it different from Locke. Diderot expresses his own opinion thus: [...] "I think that when the eyes of the born-blind are opened {{for the first time to}} the light, he will perceive nothing at all; that some time will be necessary for his eye to make experiments for itself; but that it will make these experiments itself, and in its own way, and without the help of touch." [...] This is in harmony with the modern doctrine, that there is an inherited aptitude of structure (in the eye, for instance), but that experience is an essential condition to the development and perfecting of this aptitude.] ...|$|E
60|$|All the Scansorial Picarians, however (if {{the reader}} with his proverbial {{courtesy}} will kindly pardon me the inevitable use of such very bad words), are essentially tree-haunters; and the tree-haunting and climbing habit, as is well beknown, seems particularly favourable {{to the growth of}} intelligence. Thus schoolboys climb trees--but I forgot: this is a scientific article, and such levity is inconsistent with the dignity of science. Let us be serious! Well, at any rate, monkeys, squirrels, opossums, wild cats, are all of them climbers, and all of them, in the act of clinging, jumping, and balancing themselves on boughs, gain such an accurate idea of geometrical figure, perspective, distance, and the true nature of space-relations, as could hardly be acquired in any other manner. In one word, they thoroughly understand space of three dimensions, and the <b>tactual</b> realities that answer to and underlie each visible appearance. This is the very substratum of all intelligence; and the monkeys, possessing it more profoundly than any other animals, have accordingly taken the top of the form in the competitive examination perpetually conducted by survival of the fittest.|$|E

If {{the extreme}} generality, and {{remoteness}} {{not so much}} from sense as from the visual and <b>tactual</b> imagination, {{of the laws of}} number, renders it a somewhat difficult effort of abstraction to conceive those laws as being in reality physical truths obtained by observation; the same difficulty does not exist with regard to the laws of extension. The facts of which those laws are expressions, are of a kind peculiarly accessible to the senses, and suggesting eminently distinct images to the fancy. That geometry is a strictly physical science would doubtless have been recognized in all ages, {{had it not been for}} the illusions produced by two circumstances. One of these is the characteristic property, already noticed, of the facts of geometry, that they may be collected from our ideas or mental pictures of objects as effectually as from the objects themselves. The other is, the demonstrative character of geometrical truths; which was at one time supposed to constitute a radical distinction between them and physical truths; the latter, as resting on merely probable evidence, being deemed essentially uncertain and unprecise. The advance of knowledge has, however, made it manifest that physical science, in its better understood branches, is quite as demonstrative as geometry. The task of deducing its details from a few comparatively simple principles is found to be any thing but the impossibility it was once supposed to be; and the notion of the superior certainty of geometry is an illusion, arising from the ancient prejudice which, in that science, mistakes the ideal data from which we reason, for a peculiar class of realities, while the corresponding ideal data of any deductive physical science are recognized as what they really are, hypotheses.|$|E
60|$|The {{skill of}} an uneducated {{person in the}} use of weapons, or of tools, is of a {{precisely}} similar nature. The savage who executes unerringly the exact throw which brings down his game, or his enemy, in the manner most suited to his purpose, under the operation of all the conditions necessarily involved, the weight and form of the weapon, the direction and distance of the object, the action of the wind, etc., owes this power to a long series of previous experiments, the results of which he certainly never framed into any verbal theorems or rules. The same thing may generally be said of any other extraordinary manual dexterity. Not long ago a Scotch manufacturer procured from England, at a high rate of wages, a working dyer, famous for producing very fine colors, with the view of teaching to his other workmen the same skill. The workman came; but his mode of proportioning the ingredients, in which lay the secret of the effects he produced, was by taking them up in handfuls, while the common method was to weigh them. The manufacturer sought to make him turn his handling system into an equivalent weighing system, that the general principle of his peculiar mode of proceeding might be ascertained. This, however, the man found himself quite unable to do, and therefore could impart his skill to nobody. He had, from the individual cases of his own experience, established a connection in his mind between fine effects of color, and <b>tactual</b> perceptions in handling his dyeing materials; and from these perceptions he could, in any particular case, infer the means to be employed, and the effects which would be produced, but could not put others in possession of the grounds on which he proceeded, from having never generalized them in his own mind, or expressed them in language.|$|E

50|$|Wenger's 1936 study {{examined}} {{if the same}} external stimulus {{can be used to}} demonstrate both external inhibition and disinhibition and the relationship of the external stimulus to the intensity of external inhibition and disinhibition. Wenger conditioned participants with electro-dermal response (raising the foot to avoid the shock) to a red light using repeating presentations of a red light paired with a shock to the right foot. After the participants were conditioned, the extra stimulus of a <b>tactual</b> vibration to the left hand was introduced before the red light was shown {{in the absence of a}} shock stimulus. Following the principles of external inhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the after-effect of the <b>tactual</b> vibration would inhibit the conditioned response to the red light and lead to smaller movements of the foot to the red light.Disinhibition was tested after experimental extinction, where the red light was presented multiple times without any shock reinforcement. Following the principles of disinhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the <b>tactual</b> vibration will induce a greater reaction to the light stimuli when compared to the reactions from the external inhibition test. Both of Wenger's hypotheses were confirmed; Wenger observed that both external inhibition and disinhibition could be produced by the same external stimulus (<b>tactual</b> vibration). In addition, higher intensity of the external stimulus produced greater magnitudes of external inhibition and disinhibition however the functional strengths of externally inhibited and disinhibited responses were not considered decisive.|$|E

5000|$|While touch (also called tactile or <b>tactual</b> perception) is {{considered}} one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities.

As a graduate student, she conducted an experimental study of the methods of equivalences in <b>tactual</b> perception, as was suggested by Titchener. After two semesters of experimental study, she subsequently earned her Master's degree in absentia from Vassar College in the late spring of 1893 for that work. During her work on the method of equivalents, Washburn had simultaneously developed the topic for her master’s thesis, in which was done {{on the influence of}} visual imagery on judgments of <b>tactual</b> distance and direction. In June 1894, she gave her oral presentation, and became the first woman to receive a PhD in psychology (as Mary Calkins had previously been denied her PhD because she was a woman). She was also elected to the newly established American Psychological Association. Her master's dissertation was also sent by Titchener to Wilhelm Wundt, who translated it and published it in his Philosophische Studien in 1895.|$|E

50|$|Cats, like rats, are nocturnal animals, {{sensitive}} to <b>tactual</b> cues from their vibrissae. But the cat, as a predator, must {{rely more on}} its sight.

When placed on the glass over the deep side, they either freeze or circle backward until they reach the shallow side of the cliff.|$|E
50|$|Rats do {{not depend}} upon visual cues {{like some of}} the other species tested. Their nocturnal habits lead them to seek food largely by smell. When moving about in the dark, they respond to <b>tactual</b> cues from their stiff {{whiskers}} (vibrissae) located on the snout. Hooded rats tested on the visual cliff show little preference for either side of the visual cliff apparatus as long as they could feel the glass with their vibrissae. When placed upon the glass over the deep side, they move about as if there was no cliff.|$|E
50|$|A common test used {{to measure}} the {{sensitivity}} of a person to <b>tactual</b> stimuli is measuring their two-point touch threshold. This is the smallest separation of two points at which we can sense two distinct points of contact rather than one. Different parts of the body have different degrees of tactile acuity, with extremities such as the fingers, face, and toes being the most sensitive. When two distinct points are perceived, it means that your brain receives two different signals. The differences of acuity for different parts of the body are the result of differences in the concentration of receptors.|$|E

50|$|Washburn's best-known work and, arguably, {{her most}} {{significant}} contribution to psychology was her influential textbook, The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology. Originally published in 1908, this book compiled research on experimental work in animal psychology. Her range of literature was considerable, resulting in a bibliography of 476 titles in the 1st edition, which eventually grew to 1683 titles by the 4th edition. The Animal Mind covered a range of mental activities, beginning with the senses and perception, including hearing, vision, kinesthetic, and <b>tactual</b> sensation. The books' later chapter focused upon consciousness and higher mental processes. However, the dominant focus {{of the book is}} animal behavior.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sense of}} touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms {{to feel the}} world around them. The {{environment}} acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it. To {{make sense of the}} stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or haptic perception, by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact. [...] This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material. Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect {{through the use of a}} tool or probe. Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth. The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information. [...] <b>Tactual</b> perception gives information regarding cutaneous stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), kinaesthetic stimuli (limb movement), and proprioceptive stimuli (position of the body). [...] There are varying degrees of <b>tactual</b> sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual's life. [...] It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of tactile sensitivity between each hand. This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor. Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the left and right hemisphere. [...] Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of tactile sensitivity than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.|$|E
50|$|Brain {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} the brain's ability {{to adapt to a}} changing environment, for instance to the absence or deterioration of a sense. It is conceivable that cortical re-mapping or reorganization in response to the loss of one sense may be an evolutionary mechanism that allows people to adapt and compensate by using other senses better. Functional imaging of congenitally blind patients showed a cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex during perceptual tasks such as Braille reading, tactile perception, <b>tactual</b> object recognition, sound localization, and sound discrimination. This may suggest that blind people can use their occipital lobe, generally used for vision, to perceive objects through the use of other sensory modalities. This cross modal plasticity may explain the often described tendency of blind people to show enhanced ability in the other senses.|$|E
5000|$|Touch messages, in {{comparison}} to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel {{to get to the}} brain. <b>Tactual</b> perception is achieved through the response of mechanoreceptors in the skin that detect physical stimuli. The response from a mechanoreceptor detecting pressure can be experienced as a touch, discomfort, or pain, and the force of pressure is measured by a pressure algometer and a dolorimeter. [...] Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both glabrous and hairy skin. Each mechanoreceptor is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy. [...] The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory systems in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Gainful {{employment}} {{is most often}} approached from a psychological standpoint with business, real world, and clinical applications. Specifically, the Strengths-Based Practice is a psychological approach to gainful employment that has business applications for the employed and people in management positions. In management in particular, managers who focus on employee strengths, communicate company goals, and give constructive feedback to employees promote gainful employment. One {{example of this is}} the Clifton Strengths Finder, from the book Now, Discover Your Strengths which employs positive psychology principles to build on the strengths that employees already have, as opposed to changing their weaknesses and deficiencies. According to a study done by Clifton and Harter, the strengths-based approach to gainful employment results in three major steps 1) the identification of talents, 2) the integration of talents into the employee’s image and workplace, and 3) <b>tactual</b> behavior change in which the employee begins to view his or her success {{as a result of his}} or her unique talents.|$|E

He began working under Armand Thiéry, who had been the laboratory director since 1894.Michotte wrote a publication on his research on <b>tactual</b> sense in 1905 based on his first experimental work.Between 1905 and 1908, he spent one semester of each year in Germany, working first with Wilhelm Wundt at Leipzig, then at Würzburg with Oswald Külpe. During this time he was also giving a course at Leuven on experimental psychology {{the other half of the}} year. His early work, done before World War I, was focused on logical memory and voluntary choice. Much of that work was heavily influenced by Külpe, through the employment of [...] "systematic experimental introspection".|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{with a few}} {{remarks about}} the history of Gestalt psychology—because not all {{chapters}} of this history are generally known. In the eighties of the past century, psychologists in Europe were greatly disturbed by von Ehrenfels' claim that thousands of percepts have characteristics which cannot be derived from the characteristics of their ultimate components, the so-called sensations. Chords and melodies in hearing, the shape characteristics of visual objects, the roughness or the smoothness of <b>tactual</b> impressions, and so forth were used as examples. All these [...] "Gestalt qualities" [...] have one thing in common. When the physical stimuli in question are considerably changed, while their relations are kept constant, the Gestalt qualities remain about the same. But, At the time, it was generally assumed that the sensations involved are individually determined by their individual stimuli and must therefore change when these are greatly changed. Both positive and negative esthetic characteristics of the world around us, not only of ornaments, paintings, sculptures, tunes, and so forth, but also of trees, landscapes, houses, cars—and other persons—belong to this class. That relations between the sexes largely depend on specimens of the same class need hardly be emphasized. It is, therefore, not safe to deal with problems of psychology as though there were no such qualities. And yet, beginning with Ehrenfels himself, psychologists {{have not been able to}} explain their nature.|$|E

The development of the instrument is described and the psychometric properties that were studied reported.

The analyses for the construct validity showed moderately high correlations between the <b>Tactual</b> Profile and intelligence tests. These correlations were higher for the haptic performance subtests than for the verbal tests. High correlations with other haptic tests were found. However, these associations disappeared after factoring out intelligence, possibly because current methods for examining <b>tactual</b> functioning are strongly affected by intelligence.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine the pattern of precuing {{benefits}} in a <b>tactual</b> precuing task. In contrast to visual precuing tasks, where visual precues specify a subset of potential finger responses, the <b>tactual</b> precuing task specifies a subset of finger responses tactually, and hence more directly. In Experiment 1 baseline values were established for fourchoice and two-choice <b>tactual</b> conditions. In Experiment 2 these conditions were embedded in a precuing paradigm with <b>tactual</b> precues specifying a subset of responses. Results showed a pattern of <b>tactual</b> precuing benefits that differed dramatically from the usual pattern found for visual cues. That is, the finger-cued condition produced a significant precuing advantage of 32 ms that was independent of preparation interval and the hand-cued condition showed a small (5 ms) non-significant precuing benefit. We argue that this differential pattern of results for <b>tactual</b> and visual precues is consistent with the view that <b>tactual</b> and visual precues rely in different degrees on stimulus-response translation processes involved in the selection of precued responses. With visual precues, this selection process is rather indirect and requires the involvement of the translation stage mediating between visual and response codes. With <b>tactual</b> precues, this selection process is more direct and possibly mediated by task-specific productions that relate stimuli directly and automatically to specific fingers. Overall, the results support the view that the mediating role of the translation stage is reduced with <b>tactual</b> stimuli...|$|E

Based on the method of direct estimation ofmagnitude, a high correlation between <b>tactual</b> and visual estimates for eight path lengths was found. The results of the <b>tactual</b> condition with simulated friction indicated that the perceived distance between <b>tactual</b> objects can be manipulated without requiring longer movements of an input device.
