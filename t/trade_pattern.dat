50|$|In fact, by 1957 Romania had {{substantially}} {{increased its}} Western trade; {{in that year}} trade with the West had increased to 25% of Romania’s total trade. By the early 1960s, Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej was more industrialized and productive. After World War II 80% of the population had worked in agriculture, but by 1963, 65% did. And despite the decrease in hands working the land, agricultural productivity had actually increased. Additionally, Gheorghiu-Dej had successfully begun a strong shift in trade towards the West, further separating it from the Soviet Union; Romania imported much of its industrial equipment from West Germany, Great Britain, and France.

50|$|In the {{maturity}} {{stage of the}} Product life cycle, the product is widely known and many consumers own it. In {{the maturity}} phase of the product life cycle, demand levels off and sales volume increases at a slower rate. There are several competitors by this stage and the original supplier may reduce prices to maintain market share and support sales. Profit margins decrease, but the business remains attractive because volume is high and costs, such as for development and promotion, are also lower.In addition, foreign demand for the product grows, but it is associated particularly with other developed countries, since the product is catering to high-income demands. For instance, {{in the case of}} the newly invented product, this rise in foreign demand (assisted by economies of scale) leads to a <b>trade</b> <b>pattern</b> whereby the United States exports the product to other high-income countries. Other developments also occur in the maturing product stage. Once the American firm is selling to other high-income countries, it may begin to assess the possibilities of producing abroad in addition to producing in the United States. With a plant in France, for example, not only France but other European countries can be supplied from the French facility rather than from the U.S. plant. Thus, an initial export surge by the United States is followed by a fall in U.S. exports and a likely fall in U.S. production of the good.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} {{relation}} of <b>trade</b> <b>patterns,</b> technology flows, and productivity growth; in particular, the hypothesis that foreign R&D investments which are transmitted through trade in intermediate inputs lead to domestic productivity gains. I derive several estimation equations where productivity growth {{is related to the}} growth of cumulative R&D stocks of a country's trade partners. The empirical analysis investigates this relation by simulating (Monte Carlo-style) counter factual <b>trade</b> <b>patterns,</b> and comparing the relation based on ''true'' <b>trade</b> <b>patterns</b> with the one obtained from simulated <b>trade</b> <b>patterns.</b> Among the findings: (1) I confirm earlier results showing that domestic productivity growth is positively affected by foreign countries R&D efforts. (2) There is strong evidence suggesting that the effects of trade-weighted foreign R&D vary significantly by partner country. (3) I present results which suggest that the observed trade patterns-cum-partner countries R&D investments have the predicted productivity effects. I show subsequently that this result needs to be qualified: the productivity effects do not rely on the partner countries' R&D investments and the import shares. Rather, differences in countries' R&D investments are insignificant in their effect on domestic productivity once the world's actual <b>trade</b> <b>patterns</b> are imposed. ...|$|R
