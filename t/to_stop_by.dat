5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted {{responsibility for the}} attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, the Jerome's parlors {{served as}} morgues during the flu epidemic. The next year Elisha threw a welcome-home dance for local {{soldiers}} returning from World War I in 1919. Prohibition had started by then, and {{to survive the}} J-Bar became a soda fountain. Liquor service continued, {{in the form of}} a popular drink called the Aspen Crud, still served there today, that is essentially a vanilla ice cream soda or milkshake generously spiked with bourbon.

25|$|On 22–23 February 1798 {{on his way}} to Florence as {{prisoner}} of the French, Pius VI had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> San Lorenzo Nuovo for an address to the population. On 10 August 1929, a memorial stone was placed on the house of family Pacetti, to commemorate the visit of the prisoner pope. Bands of Giuseppe Garibaldi's followers crossed into the Papal States in September 1867 and came into fights with the Papal Zouaves. On the territory of San Lorenzo Nuovo, Monte Landro was the theatre of the defeat of Garibaldi's men.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{was used}} on the Harwich - Hook of Holland route. During the First World War, her captain, Fryatt, was twice {{recognised}} for his actions. On 3 March 1915, he evaded a German U-boat {{for which he was}} awarded a gold watch by the Great Eastern Railway. On 28 March 1915, Brussels was ordered <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> U-33 when she was near the Maas Lightship, but Fryatt attempted to ram the U-boat, which was forced to crash dive. For this action, the Admiralty awarded him a gold watch. The First Officer and Chief Engineer also received gold watches from the Admiralty for this action.|$|E

25|$|On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> his Park Lane apartment. When {{he arrived}} he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided {{to drop the}} {{prosecution}} against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed {{that he had been}} routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{happened when}} an express train from Tabriz to Mashhad stopped because of technical {{problems associated with}} cold weather between Semnan and Damghan. The second express train, which was travelling from Semnan to Mashhad on the same track, was ordered <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the dispatcher, and the signals turned red. The shift for the dispatcher changed before {{the problem with the}} first train was resolved. At this point, the second train asked for permission to resume its journey which was then approved by the new dispatcher. The second train gained full speed, then hit the first train from behind. As a result of the collision four carriages derailed; two of them caught fire. Forty-seven passengers and crew from both trains were reported dead, and more than 100 reported injured. The injured were taken to hospitals in Semnan and Damghan.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E

25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated that she wanted <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police {{told her it was}} from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Banda {{supported}} {{both the}} government and the guerrilla movement during the Mozambique civil war. He successfully gave the Malawi Army and Malawi Young Pioneers opposing missions in Mozambique from 1987 to 1992. He had the Malawi Army support the Mozambican government, controlled by FRELIMO after the country's independence in 1975, to defend Malawi's interests in Mozambique. This was done formally through an agreement in 1984 with Samora Machel. Simultaneously, Banda used the MYP as couriers and active supporters of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), which had been fighting against Machel's government since the late 1970s. Malawi was used to channel foreign aid from South Africa's apartheid government. Machel issued a dossier to Frontline States with evidence that Banda was still supporting the insurgents in spite of the 1984 agreement <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>By</b> September 1986, Machel, Robert Mugabe, and Kenneth Kaunda visited Banda to persuade him to stop supporting RENAMO. Machel's successor, Joaquim Chissano, continued to complain of Malawi's lack of willingness to stop supporting Renamo. Banda however was trying to keep Malawian interests in the Port of Nacala in Mozambique {{and did not want to}} rely on Tanzania and South Africa ports for its imports and exports due to the expense. Mozambique and Malawi came to an agreement to place troops from both countries in Nayuchi near the port. Incidents of Malawi Army members being killed over the course of four years angered the Army because MYP members were involved with the insurgents, essentially pitting the two against each other.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E

500|$|Like {{his friend}} Eric Clapton, George Harrison was {{inspired}} by Music from Big Pink, the seminal debut album from the Band, the former backing group for Bob Dylan. Released in July 1968, Music from Big Pink was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument, after he had spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian sitar. Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring Big Pink [...] "the new sound to come from America", drummer Levon Helm later recalled, thus helping to establish the Band internationally. In appreciation, Robbie Robertson, the Band's guitarist, extended an invitation to Harrison <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> in Woodstock, New York, when the opportunity arose.|$|E

500|$|The area {{soon became}} a tourist {{attraction}} for the early South Australian colonists, and was a popular destination for picnickers. In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that [...] "Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque place for a picnic that I have ever visited", and by the 1860s the area had become known throughout Adelaide. The use of Waterfall Gully as picnic spot was facilitated by {{the decision of the}} government of the day not to subdivide the area containing the waterfalls. Section 920, as it was designated, did not enter into private hands, and thus members of the public were able to access the area from the nearby suburb of Eagle on the Hill on Mount Barker road. The position of the Eagle on the Hill hotel proved advantageous for this, as it permitted visitors <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> for lunch before walking down the hill in the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|The {{most famous}} regular {{customer}} is comedian Bill Cosby, {{who took his}} future wife to Ben's when they were dating. He recalls that he first became a frequent visitor while serving in the Navy and stationed in Bethesda, Maryland in 1958, and frequently visited the U Street jazz clubs. Cosby recalls that during some of his visits with Camille, who was then {{a student at the}} University of Maryland, he would [...] "eat as many as six half-smokes at a time." [...] Cosby returned to Ben's in 1985 to hold a press conference in the restaurant to celebrate the success of his television series, The Cosby Show. He continues <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> Ben's while in town for servings of half-smokes. A sign posted in the restaurant proclaimed that Bill Cosby is the only person who eats for free at Ben's Chili Bowl. On November 3, 2008, a new sign was posted to add [...] "the Obama family". In January 2017, Ben's Chili Bowl painted over a large mural of Bill Cosby which had stood for over 50 years.|$|E
500|$|The San Diego trio did however {{accumulate}} {{a genuine}} buzz among major labels, and {{a bidding war}} for the band began in March 1996. Several labels courted the band, sending A reps to shows and inviting the band <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the office for lunch meetings. Through the several labels interested, Blink-182 seriously considered Interscope, Epitaph, and MCA Records (the latter of which had just purchased Interscope {{and was in the}} process of buying Cargo). The band spent much time during the spring and summer of 1996 contemplating options. The three had no qualms signing to a major label, and were wary of purists attempting to define [...] "punk". The band felt a great affinity for Epitaph, as many of their favorite acts (Pennywise, Bad Religion, NOFX) were signed there. The band felt they were nothing but honest regarding their ambitions: [...] "I try and tell kids, 'The Clash, Sex Pistols and the Ramones did it, so how come we can't?" [...] guitarist Tom DeLonge reasoned. [...] "If people are bummed, we don't care. It's normally critics. Older critics." ...|$|E
