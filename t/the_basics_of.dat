5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since <b>the</b> <b>basics</b> <b>of</b> this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E

5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up <b>the</b> <b>basics</b> <b>of</b> musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons.

This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{designated}} {{simply as}} Training Battalion, {{it was under}} the command of Major Francis Voelcker. The battalion was based at Samambula Camp where it would undergo training for the next several months. In May 1941, the bulk of the battalion's personnel returned to New Zealand and onwards to the Middle East to join the 2nd New Zealand Division. Fourteen soldiers volunteered for duty as coast watchers in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and consequently left the battalion. Some others, including Voelcker who had been promoted to lieutenant colonel, remained in Fiji to form the cadre around which the battalion was to be reformed with newly arrived personnel. The battalion, now known as Reserve Battalion, resumed training and garrison duty. Many personnel had only received minimal military training in New Zealand before being shipped to Fiji and much time had to be spent on <b>the</b> <b>basics</b> <b>of</b> warfare and tactics.|$|E
