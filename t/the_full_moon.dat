Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her widowhood and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> in the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May). The day of <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination.

They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing.|$|E
50|$|In the 21st and 22nd centuries, it is {{the years}} in which <b>the</b> Paschal <b>Full</b> <b>Moon</b> on <b>the</b> Gregorian tables falls on its latest {{possible}} date (18 April), the year 2019 and every nineteenth year after that, when the Aleppo method gives Easter approximately a month earlier than the Gregorian method. This is because the gradually accumulating gap between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> means that in these years, <b>the</b> true <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> in March occurs just after the equinox; while <b>the</b> equivalent <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> in <b>the</b> Gregorian algorithm falls on 20 March (the approximated equinox), meaning that <b>the</b> Paschal <b>Full</b> <b>Moon</b> is delayed until the following month. In the year 2000 (which is technically part of the 20th century), however, {{this is not the}} case. One might think, based on the occurrences in 2019 and every nineteenth year after that, that the Aleppo method would give 26 March as Easter Sunday for 2000. However, the gap between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> had not yet widened enough to place <b>the</b> true March <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> after <b>the</b> equinox; in 2000 a <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> occurred at 07:05 Jerusalem time on 20 March, before the March equinox at 09:36 Jerusalem time the same day; as a result, <b>the</b> Paschal <b>Full</b> <b>Moon</b> was not until the following month (as it is defined as <b>the</b> first <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> after <b>the</b> equinox), and the date given for Easter 2000 by the Aleppo method was therefore 23 April, the same as by the Gregorian method.|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain a}} global {{perspective}} of coral reproductive patterns, {{there is a}} clear need for more descriptive studies from under-represented regions (e. g., Thailand). As such, this study provides the first data on the timing of gamete maturation and spawning of seven species of Favia from Thailand. Corals in the inner and eastern Gulf of Thailand (GOT) spawned following <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moons</b> of February/March, whereas spawning in the southwestern GOT and the Andaman Sea occurred 1 month later following <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moons</b> of March/April. Aquarium observations of five Favia species confirmed spawning between five and six nights after <b>the</b> respective <b>full</b> <b>moon,</b> with <b>the</b> time of release of gametes overlapping among species. Further research on gametogenesis in additional coral species is required to document whether the spawning patterns exhibited by Favia are typical of all coral species in Thailand...|$|R

5|$|The festival {{takes place}} in late May or early June, to {{coincide}} with <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moon.</b> It falls one week before the Christian feast of Corpus Christi. Events include several processions of holy icons and dances {{in and around the}} shrine of the Lord of Quyllurit'i. The culminating event for the indigenous non-Christian population takes place after the reappearance of Qullqa in the night sky; it is the rising of the sun after <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moon.</b> Tens of thousands of people kneel to greet the first rays of light as the sun rises above the horizon. The main event for the Church is carried out by ukukus, who climb glaciers over Qullqipunku and bring back crosses and blocks of ice to place along the road to the shrine. These are believed to be medicinal with healing qualities.|$|E

However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.|$|E
25|$|Easter is {{the third}} Sunday in the paschal lunar month, or, in other words, the Sunday after the paschal lunar month's 14th day.

5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>moon</b> than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E

Stage two was communicated through a sub-plan called Dungloe, involving double agents back in England. The story passed to the Germans was that radio messages would inform friendly leaders in Yugoslavia of the intended invasion dates and any delays.|$|E
