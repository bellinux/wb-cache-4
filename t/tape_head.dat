500|$|The first {{design for}} a program-controlled {{computer}} was Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in the 1830s. A century later, in 1936, mathematician Alan Turing published his description of {{what became known as}} a Turing machine, a theoretical concept intended to explore the limits of mechanical computation. Turing was not imagining a physical machine, but a person he called a [...] "computer", who acted according to the instructions provided by a tape on which symbols could be read and written sequentially as the tape moved under a <b>tape</b> <b>head.</b> Turing proved that if an algorithm can be written to solve a mathematical problem, then a Turing machine can execute that algorithm.|$|E

2500|$|Laurie Anderson's tape-bow violin, an {{electronic}} instrument developed in 1977, resembles an electric violin {{but does not}} have strings. It produces sound by drawing a bow, strung with a length of recorded magnetic tape rather than hair, across a magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> mounted on the instrument where the bridge would normally be. This somehow anticipates the later technique of [...] "scratching" [...] in rap and hip-hop music, where a vinyl recording is turned {{back and forth on}} a turntable.|$|E

50|$|An early {{method used}} to get a higher data rate than the {{prevailing}} linear method was transverse scan. In this method a spinning disk, with the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> embedded in the outer edge, is placed perpendicular to {{the path of the}} tape. This method is used in Ampex's DCRsi instrumentation data recorders and the old Ampex quadruplex videotape system. Another early method was arcuate scan. In this method, the heads are on the face of a spinning disk which is laid flat against the tape. The path of the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> makes an arc.|$|R
2500|$|Magnetic tape {{revolutionized}} {{broadcast and}} recording. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, {{based on the}} invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide (Fe2O3) powder coating on a long strip of paper. This invention was further developed by the German electronics company AEG, which manufactured the recording machines and BASF, which manufactured the tape. In 1933, working for AEG, [...] developed the ring shaped <b>tape</b> <b>head.</b> Eduard Schüller, was a German engineer {{and he had a}} decisive {{role in the development of}} the rape recorder and the videorecorders. Previous head designs were needle shaped and tended to shred the tape.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} configuration, rather than playing {{a pair of}} stereo channels of {{each side of the}} cassette, the typical [...] "portastudio" [...] used a four-track <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> assembly to access four tracks on the cassette at once (with the tape playing in one direction). Each track could be recorded to, erased, or played back individually, allowing musicians to overdub themselves and create simple multitrack recordings easily, which could then be mixed down to a finished stereo version on an external machine. To increase audio quality in these recorders, the tape speed sometimes was doubled to 3¾inches per second, in comparison to the standard 17⁄8 ips; additionally, dbx, Dolby B or Dolby C noise reduction provided compansion (compression of the signal during recording with equal and opposite expansion of the signal during playback), which yields increased dynamic range by lowering the noise level and increasing the maximum signal level before distortion occurs. Multi-track cassette recorders with built-in mixer and signal routing features ranged from easy-to-use beginner units up to professional-level recording systems.|$|E
5000|$|LTO Ultrium tape is {{laid out}} with four wide data bands {{sandwiched}} between five narrow servo bands. The <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> assembly, that reads from and writes to the tape, straddles a single data band and the two adjacent servo bands. The <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> has 8, 16, or 32 data read/write head elements and 2 servo read elements. The set of 8, 16, or 32 tracks are read or written in a single, one-way, end-to-end pass that is called a [...] "wrap". The <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> shifts laterally to access the different wraps within each band and also to access the other bands.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{quality was}} {{compromised}} due {{the use of}} longitudinal audio <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> in combination with slow tape speed. Sony eventually implemented Dolby noise reduction circuitry (using Dolby C) to improve audio fidelity.|$|R
5000|$|In all tape formats, a {{tape drive}} (or [...] "transport" [...] or [...] "deck") uses motors to wind the tape from one reel to another, passing <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> to read, write or erase as it moves.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{experience}} in manufacturing magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks {{for a number}} of foreign manufacturers including Harman Kardon, KLH, Advent, Fisher, ELAC, Sylvania, Concord, Ampex and Motorola.|$|R

5000|$|Cassette demagnetizers of the [...] "cassette" [...] type {{physically}} {{resemble a}} cassette tape shell but contain circuitry to demagnetize the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> of the <b>tape</b> deck. Another type of demagnetizer, the [...] "wand" [...] type can demagnetize anything {{that it is}} brought into contact with, including the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> and capstans. Nakamichi manufactured a [...] "wand" [...] type demagnetizer in the 1980s. This design had the advantage {{that it could be}} used to demagnetize other metal parts of the tape path (not just the actual record/playback heads) however it required careful use (to avoid increasing the magnetization of the heads) and if used too close to actual cassette tapes could inadvertently act as a [...] "bulk eraser".|$|R
5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording tape through {{the mechanism of}} a tape recorder. The tape is threaded between the capstan and one or more rubber-covered wheels, called pinch rollers, which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull the tape. The capstan is always placed downstream (in the direction of tape motion) from the <b>tape</b> <b>heads.</b> To maintain the required tension against the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> and {{other part of the}} tape transport, a small amount of drag is placed on the supply reel. Tape recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no pinch rollers, the line simply being wound around them.|$|R

5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the <b>tape</b> <b>heads,</b> instead of {{moving across the}} tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Nakamichi {{developed}} one of {{the first}} open reel tape recorders in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>heads,</b> as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The TASCAM 85 16B analog tape {{recorder}} can record 16 tracks of audio on 1-inch (2.54cm) tape. Professional analog units of 24 tracks on 2-inch tape were common, with specialty <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> providing 16 or even 8 tracks {{on the same}} tape width, for greater fidelity.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>head,</b> disk read-and-write heads - {{converts}} {{magnetic fields}} on a magnetic medium {{to and from}} electrical signals ...|$|E
50|$|Each of the diagonal-angled tracks is a {{complete}} TV picture field, lasting 1/60th of a second (1/50th on PAL) on the display. One <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> records an entire picture field. The adjacent track, recorded by the second <b>tape</b> <b>head,</b> is another 1/60th or 1/50th of a second TV picture field, and so on. Thus one complete head rotation records an entire NTSC or PAL frame of two fields.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} field of invention {{during this period}} was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a <b>tape</b> <b>head,</b> which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the <b>tape</b> <b>head</b> acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.|$|E
50|$|The {{linear method}} {{arranges}} data in long parallel tracks that span {{the length of}} the <b>tape.</b> Multiple <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> simultaneously write parallel tape tracks on a single medium. This method was used in early tape drives. It is the simplest recording method, but has the lowest data density.|$|R
50|$|When using analog tape {{recording}} technology, they may exhibit {{a type of}} noise known as tape hiss. This {{is related to the}} particle size and texture used in the magnetic emulsion that is sprayed on the recording media, and also to the relative tape velocity across the <b>tape</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cassette decks {{reached their}} {{pinnacle}} {{of performance and}} complexity by the mid-1980s. Cassette decks from companies such as Nakamichi, Revox, and Tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple <b>tape</b> <b>heads</b> and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors. Auto-reversing decks became popular and were standard on most factory installed automobile decks.|$|R
