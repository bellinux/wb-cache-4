I stopped making trouble," [...] said Love. [...] "I stopped." [...] Hole's classic track [...] "Violet" [...] features the lyrics [...] "And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent", alluding to lyrics from Smith's [...] "Kimberly". Love later stated that she considered [...] "Rock n Roll Nigger" [...] the greatest rock song of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Birt {{was made}} unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, {{appointed}} {{for what was}} termed [...] "Blue skies thinking" [...] and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be [...] "worth every penny"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset – he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair’s principal private secretary, said: “He liked the way that John was willing to get right down into the data and understand the evidence, {{and come up with}} [...] a real sense <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things in a totally different way.” [...] Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London. His 2004 report on drug policy recommended making heroin use a criminal offence on par with possession.|$|E
2500|$|The Yorkshireman was 'tough, combative, grudging, shrewd, and an instinctive {{reader of}} the game', and an experienced, no-nonsense captain who {{expected}} his team to play like professionals. David Gower wrote 'no matter how highly Ray might regard you as a player {{he would not have}} you in his team, come hell or high water, unless he was utterly convinced <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the job he had allocated to you'. He encouraged 'difficult' players like Geoff Boycott and John Snow who responded with their best Test form. 'Most of all, because he insisted on his [...] "own side", he was able to get the best out of his players, both mentally and physically. He built up a tremendous team spirit which stood us in good stead on numerous occasions', and they tended to close ranks and treat the opposition, umpires, press and public as the enemy, an attitude that became prevalent amongst Test teams in the 1970s. In all he captained England in 31 Test matches, winning 12, losing 5 and drawing 14.|$|E

2500|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 after a {{contract}} dispute {{it looked like}} the 36-year-old off-spinner's Test career was over. However, he transferred to Leicestershire and was made county captain. Although he had never been captain his great experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have guided Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. He had an immediate effect on the unfancied Midlands side, which would take them to four one day trophies in the early 1970s and the County Championship in 1975. The selectors had long regarded Kent's Colin Cowdrey as England's natural captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had {{been in and out of}} the national side for years and had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was chosen over his rivals such as former captain Brian Close or vice-captain Tom Graveney as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's England collapsed to 61/5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2-0 and remained captain even when Cowdrey recovered. In 1970 Illingworth had yet to lose a Test and overall he captained England in 31 Tests in 1969-73, winning 12, drawing 14 and losing 5.
