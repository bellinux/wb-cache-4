40|$|International audienceThe {{challenge}} for innovation {{has shifted from}} meeting uncertainties <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>through</b> a waiting game. The topic of 'waiting games' - or technology impasses - has not been addressed in the innovation literature, while it is clearly {{important to understand the}} phenomenon, {{and to be able to}} do something about it. We call this a waiting game because it occurs over and above the strategies of individual actors, even if there is general acceptance that the technology is promising and innovation is necessary.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to break this {{resistance}} and allow the northwards advance to continue, the Australians attempted to outflank the Japanese defensive line by launching an amphibious landing at Porton Plantation on 8 June.

Due to poor planning, inadequate resources and strong Japanese defence, the landing failed at considerable cost to Australians, and as their efforts turned towards effecting a withdrawal from the beachhead and rescuing the stranded men, the attempt by the main force <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>through</b> from Ratsua also failed as tired troops came up against strong Japanese defensive positions.|$|E
