5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E
5|$|Written by Clayton Hickman. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Britain under attack by an alien, who gives one of the Bannerman Road children a remote which can rewind and erase time itself. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> then transform into the alien and kidnap Sarah Jane and the gang, thus erasing them from time.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at this point that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have been officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
50|$|After lunch, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> line up {{once again}} inside the building, {{pick up their}} bed rolls which {{consisted}} of a pillow, a sheet and an army-type blanket.

5|$|Rousseau hiked to {{the radio}} tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating {{distress}} call. Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> grow up healthy, {{but with}} some of the {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|Michael's mother, Dowager Empress Marie, {{moved back}} to Anichkov Palace with Michael and Olga. Like most male members of his family, Michael was {{enrolled}} in the military. He completed training at a gunnery school and joined the Horse Guards Artillery. In November 1898, he attained legal adulthood and, just eight months later, became heir presumptive to Nicholas as the middle brother, George, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident. George's death and the subsequent change in the line of succession highlighted that Nicholas lacked a son. As the succession was limited to males, his three daughters were ineligible. When Nicholas's wife, Alexandra, became pregnant in 1900 she hoped that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be male. She manoeuvred to get herself declared regent for her unborn child in the event of Nicholas's death, but the government disagreed and determined that Michael would succeed regardless of the unborn child's gender. She was delivered of a fourth daughter the following year.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the birth}} {{certificate}}, <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan child of Suparman and Wulandari". The birth certificate of an extramarital <b>child</b> <b>would</b> bear only <b>the</b> mother's name. On a school diploma, <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan, child of Suparman".

5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E
5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king seated on the Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 survey {{reveals that}} PGD has {{occasionally}} {{been used to}} select an embryo {{for the presence of}} a particular disease or disability, such as deafness, in order that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> share that characteristic with the parents.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, 300,000 {{children}} were restavecs, which are somewhat like indentured service for minors. This {{was done by}} their parents in order that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be fed.|$|R
25|$|Also {{important}} was selecting the right day for intercourse {{if a person}} desired children. After the woman's period, the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man ejaculated after midnight, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> likely be male. If a female child was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's period.|$|E
25|$|A 1989 {{survey found}} that 75.8 percent of its {{respondents}} believed that abortion should be legally permitted if the mother's life is in danger or <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be born deformed. More recently in 2000, 77.9 percent of survey respondents said abortion should be permitted if the mother's life is in danger, and 55.1 {{percent of respondents said}} abortion should be permitted if the pregnancy is the result of rape.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, he {{allegedly}} began dating Lauren Silverman. In July 2013, her husband, Andrew Silverman, filed for an at-fault divorce in New York, citing adultery {{by his wife}} and naming Cowell as a co-respondent. News of the divorce filing became public two weeks later, when it was widely reported that Lauren Silverman and Cowell were expecting a baby. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be Cowell's first, but the second for Silverman, who has a son with Andrew Silverman.|$|E

25|$|When the {{shepherd}} arrives Oedipus questions him, but he begs {{to be allowed}} to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius's own son, and that Jocasta had given the baby to {{the shepherd}} to secretly be exposed upon the mountainside. This was done in fear of the prophecy that Jocasta said had never come true: that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> kill his father.|$|E
25|$|Shoji {{lives with}} a bar hostess, {{wondering}} {{what it would be}} like to have a child with her and whether <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> grow up as a Napoleon or Hitler. Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, if the father's {{name was}} not a {{specific}} family name, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> take his patronymic as a family name, so names in a chain of generations would shift. For example, the son of Petar Stoyanov Ivanov would be Georgi Petrov Stoyanov, his son would be Ivaylo Georgiev Petrov, his son would be Marin Ivaylov Georgiev. This practice often caused confusion in the past, especially when dealing for foreign institutions, since a child did not bear his father's family name. However, the recent generation has all but abandoned this practice.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the birth}} certificate, <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan Herianto child of Suparman Herianto and Wulandari Sulistyo". On all other {{official}} documents, <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan Herianto".|$|R

25|$|Abortion {{was portrayed}} in 2001 {{with a story}} which divided the country when Kay decided to abort her {{pregnancy}} against {{the wishes of the}} father Malachy. As an older mother Kay has amniocentesis tests done which reveal the child has trisomy-13 which means that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be born severely disabled and probably would not survive long after birth. The storyline was seen by the actors and producers as controversial and heart-breaking. They recognised the time sensitive nature of the decisions that had to be made and the potential impacts and worked to show it all. This storyline caused anti-abortion viewers to complain to the Justice Minister {{on the grounds that the}} story was hate speech against people with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, eat on her own bed or in secret, or consume dried meat of any kind or the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from one's father and, when charged by the father, denied it on oath, and the father then died before the child confessed to the father's heirs, then <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have to repay the {{principal}} and a fifth to the father's other children or to the father's brothers (the child's uncles) if the child had no siblings. But if the child was unwilling to forfeit the child's share in the payment that child had to make, or if the child had no resources, then the child was to borrow the amount from others and perform the duty of restoration to the heirs, and the creditors could subsequently come and demand to be paid the portion that would by law have belonged to the child as heir..|$|E
