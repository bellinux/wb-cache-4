5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the males}} and larvae differ from other deep-sea {{anglerfish}} in having slender bodies. Mature males are only known from parasitic specimens already attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> largest known specimen is 18 mm long. They are lighter in color than <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and have semitranslucent skin. They are attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> by outgrowths of the snout and lower jaw; the olfactory organs are absent {{and the eyes}} are degenerate and covered with skin. The larvae are 4-10 mm long, with well-developed olfactory organs and no sexual dimorphism.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
50|$|Adult E. solidaginis {{emerge from}} their galls in the spring, with the males {{emerging}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> flies proceed <b>to</b> mate on goldenrod plants, and <b>the</b> <b>females</b> use their ovipositors to insert fertilized eggs into the buds of the goldenrod.|$|R
25|$|Along with {{chemical}} pheromones, {{the presence of}} nuptial gifts {{plays an important role}} in the mating and courtship process. During the physical act of copulation, males transfer nutritious materials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> These extra nutrients given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> can be used by a female to her advantage during the process of oogenesis. The use of nuptial gifts in the mating process, especially when females mate with multiple males, relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of <b>female</b> choice in deciding egg fertilization.|$|R

5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E

50|$|Sperm {{precedence}} can be temporal, favoring {{either the}} first or last male <b>to</b> breed <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> (<b>The</b> former is known as first sperm precedence and the latter is known as last sperm precedence); or it can favor the male whose sperm are the most motile; or the male whose sperm were delivered closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> ova.|$|R
25|$|During mating, {{the male}} copepod grips <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{with his first}} pair of antennae, which is {{sometimes}} modified for this purpose. The male then produces an adhesive package of sperm and transfers it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> genital opening with his thoracic limbs. Eggs are sometimes laid directly into the water, but many species enclose them within a sac attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> body until they hatch. In some pond-dwelling species, the eggs have a tough shell and can lie dormant for extended periods if the pond dries up.|$|R
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January {{with one or}} two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other pintails, {{the males}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> though larger. <b>The</b> ducks are 45 to 65cm in length, the males weighing 610 <b>to</b> 660 g, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> 460 <b>to</b> 610 g. Minor differences are that the male has uniformly brownish-grey upperwing coverts and a glossy greenish-black speculum, while <b>the</b> <b>female</b> has mottled upperwing coverts and a dull brown speculum.|$|R

The video then shows Woodruff in his bedroom, tearing {{a picture of her}} in two. He falls asleep and dreams about her. The scene changes back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> bedroom, where she notices Woodruff standing outside of her window, holding a radio (hence the line, [...] "I'm outside of your window, with my radio."). <b>The</b> <b>female</b> walks away, seemingly turning Woodruff down.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other pintails, {{the males}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> though larger. <b>The</b> ducks are 45 to 65 cm in length, the males weighing 610 <b>to</b> 660 g, <b>the</b> <b>females</b> 460 <b>to</b> 610 g.

5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E
5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|E
50|$|Females {{typically}} have more spots than males. Males have more costally placed eyespots, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> whose eyespots are more {{spread over the}} wing margin.|$|R

50|$|Butterflies {{spend much}} time searching for mates. When the male spots a mate, he will fly closer and release pheromones. He then {{performs}} a special courtship dance <b>to</b> attract <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>female</b> appreciates <b>the</b> dancing she may join him. Then they join their bodies together end to end at their abdomens. Here, the male passes <b>the</b> sperm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> egg-laying tube, which will soon be fertilised by the sperm. The male often dies shortly after mating.|$|R
5|$|Various {{courtship}} behaviours {{have been}} observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses {{to pick up and}} place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|E
5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males to stay close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{before and during the}} egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E

50|$|During mating, {{the male}} {{typically}} approaches <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> grasping <b>the</b> ventral region of <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> mantle while using <b>the</b> dorsal arm <b>to</b> transfer <b>the</b> spermatophores <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> mantle cavity.
