Over the past decades, many control techniques have been proposed for induction motors drive system. One of the most well-known control method for controlling the speed and torque of the induction motor is Field-Oriented Control (FOC) technique. Modeling and control of faulty or an unbalanced <b>three-phase</b> induction <b>motor</b> (two stator phases open-circuit) is obviously different from healthy <b>three-phase</b> induction <b>motor.</b> Using conventional FOC for faulty <b>three-phase</b> induction <b>motor,</b> results in a significant torque and speed oscillation under fault conditions.

50|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} three-phase load is the electric motor. A three-phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high efficiency. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor</b> is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor {{of the same}} voltage class and rating and single-phase AC motors above 10 HP (7.5 kW) are uncommon.

50|$|A common {{measure of}} the quality of the power {{produced}} by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor.</b> Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the power factor of the RPC motor combination as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors. Three-phase induction motors are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally the {{magnetic}} wave would be generated either by physically moving a magnet or by {{an arrangement of}} coils switched in sequence, such as occurs on the stator of a <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor.</b> Flux Pumping is a solid state method where a material which changes magnetic state at a suitable magnetic ordering temperature is heated at its edge and the resultant thermal wave produces a magnetic wave which then magnetizes the superconductor. A superconducting flux pump {{should not be confused}} with a classical flux pump as described in Van Klundert et al.’s review.|$|E
50|$|If {{connections}} to the rotor coils of a <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor</b> are taken out on slip-rings and fed a separate field current to create a continuous magnetic field (or if the rotor consists of a permanent magnet), the result is called a synchronous motor because the rotor will rotate synchronously with the rotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase electrical supply. Another synchronous motor system is the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed synchronous motor system with an independently excited rotor multiphase AC winding set that may experience slip-induction beyond synchronous speeds but like all synchronous motors, does not rely on slip-induction for torque production.|$|E
50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor.</b> The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.) An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|E

50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} start motor. It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a <b>three-phase</b> <b>motor</b> is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|E

Ferraris demonstrated a working model of his single-phase induction motor in 1885, and Tesla built his working two-phase induction motor in 1887 and demonstrated it at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1888 (although Tesla claimed that he conceived the rotating magnetic field in 1882). In 1888, Ferraris published his research to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin, where he detailed the foundations of motor operation; Tesla, in the same year, was granted a United States patent for his own motor. Working from Ferraris's experiments, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. He also invented the first three-phase generator and transformer and combined them into the first complete AC three-phase system in 1891.
