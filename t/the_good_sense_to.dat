500|$|Feynman {{nominally}} held {{an appointment}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{as an assistant}} professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to be back at the only university that ever had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> fire me." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{claimed that}} Chapman {{was not a}} subtle captain and lacked {{tactical}} astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him {{to be one of}} the best captains. Arthur Gilligan, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to be a model for the role, and Bert Oldfield, who played against Chapman as Australia's wicket-keeper, thought that Chapman possessed an [...] "aptitude" [...] for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them." [...] Cricket writer E. W. Swanton believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that [...] "underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> ask advice from those of greater experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E

2500|$|Back in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully {{applied for}} the Archeology Chair created at the University of Iași, but lost; {{according}} to scholar and diarist Teohari Antonescu, who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara [...] "had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> come prepared." [...] From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts. As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through {{a relationship with the}} Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, Dorobanți. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called [...] "my most generous protector" [...] and [...] "the sovereign [...] ". Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called [...] "the animator of Romanian art". For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the Carmen Sylva signature. Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in spiritism or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz.|$|E

5000|$|Olin Downes praised a Salzburg {{performance}} of his Five Pieces for String Quartet in 1924: [...] These pieces attempted only to charm or entertain. They had spontaneous humor, sentiment, a fluent and admirable technic.sic The idiom has enough modern pepper in it to constantly stimulate the ear; but the music is not forced, {{any more than it}} is portentous. A young composer of talent disported himself in these pieces, and his audience was duly grateful. Not all composers, old or young, have <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not <b>to</b> take themselves, now and again, too seriously.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{sort code}} and thereby impossible to break.

60|$|Armand was vexed that de Batz {{was sitting}} there. He {{felt he could}} have told this dainty little lady quite {{a good deal about}} England if only his pompous, fat friend would have had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> go away.|$|E

5000|$|Morris' {{historic}} judgeship garnered favorable review {{upon the}} completion of her term in the South Pass News, as her son Archy was the editor.

6000|$|... "What {{are you two}} {{laughing}} so about?" [...] {{the voice}} of Mrs. Westangle twittered at Verrian's elbow, and, looking down, he found her almost touching it. She had a very long, narrow neck, and, since it was long and narrow, she had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not <b>to</b> palliate <b>the</b> fact or try to dress the effect of it out of sight. She took her neck in both hands, as it were, and put it more on show, so that you had really to like it.

To me he is sterling gold, {{but he is not}} like your people. My dear mother is not at all like your ladies. She is not a lady in your sense,--though with her unselfish devotion to others she is something infinitely better. For myself I am,--well, meaning to speak honestly, I will call myself pretty and smart. I think I know how to be true." ...|$|R
60|$|Never {{was such}} a hubbub in the world! In vain Herbert claimed his wife, and {{expressed}} his astonishment, declaring that he had parted from her with the expression of perfect kind feeling on both sides. No answer was given to his letter, and no explanation of any kind conceded him. The world universally declared Lady Annabel an injured woman, and trusted that she would eventually have <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and kindness <b>to</b> gratify them by revealing the mystery; while Herbert, on the contrary, was universally abused and shunned, avoided by his acquaintances, and denounced as the most depraved of men.|$|R

5000|$|... "He weaves his own {{fast-moving}} chords and filigree work so nimbly {{that it is}} hard {{to believe}} fingers can physically shift so quickly. Slight moustached, fairly balding, he frowns over his fretwork like a worried head waiter with more guests than tables but the sound that comes out could only be the confident product of years of devotion to the instrument... But it is when he plays completely solo, which he does for half of each set, that he comes into his own, because without hindrance of the rhythm section he can completely orchestrate each number. Sometimes it is by contrasting out of tempo sections with fast-moving interludes, sometimes by switching mood from wistful to lightly swinging, sometimes by alternating single-note lines with chords or simultaneous bass line and melody-the possibilities seem endless. Luckily, there is a new L.P. by him which captures all this on vinyl, as someone has had <b>the</b> unusual <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> record him all alone. It is called Virtuoso and rightly so." [...] - Miles Kington on Pass in an October 1974 article in The Times.|$|R
60|$|The {{belief in}} the {{efficacy}} of fairy ointment {{appears to have been}} somewhat generally held in England. A Northumberland tradition tells of a midwife who was fetched to attend a lady, and who received a box of ointment with which to anoint the infant. By accident the woman touched one of her eyes with the mixture, and at once saw that she was in a fairy palace. She had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense,</b> however, <b>to</b> conceal her astonishment, and reached her home in safety. Some time afterwards she saw the lady stealing bits of butter in the market-place, and thoughtlessly accosted her, when, after an inquiry {{similar to that of the}} Lancashire legend, the fairy breathed upon the offending eye and destroyed the sight. Other versions still current in Northumberland make the thief a fairy stealing corn. Similar stories are told in Devonshire and in both the Lowlands and Highlands of Scotland. In Scotland, however, the fairy spits into the woman's eye. The Irish fairy (Co. Wexford), a vindictive being, uses a switch.|$|R
