The aim of this study was to investigate whether TGF β 1 - 509 C/T polymorphism could be used as a susceptibility marker in Uterine fibroids pathogenesis. ARMS PCR was carried out for controls and patients (n= 103) to identify the specific genotypes. Genotypes and allelic frequencies in both groups were compared.

Disbalance of bone homeostasis associated with malfunctioning of RANK/RANKL/OPG system underlies such oncological processes as the destruction of bone, metastasis development, tumor progression.

40|$|Urinary bladder cancer (UBC) ranks {{ninth in}} {{worldwide}} cancer. In Egypt, {{the pattern of}} bladder cancer is unique in that both the transitional and squamous cell types prevail. Despite much research on the topic, it is still difficult to predict tumor progression, optimal therapy and clinical outcome. The reduced folate carrier (RFC/SLC 19 A 1) is the major transport system for folates in mammalian cells and tissues. RFC is also the primary means of cellular uptake for antifolate cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, however, membrane transport of antifolates by RFC is considered as limiting to antitumor activity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the mRNA expression level of RFC/SLC 19 A 1 in urothelial and non-urothelial variants of bladder carcinomas. Quantification of RFC mRNA in the mucosa of 41 untreated bladder cancer patients was performed using RT-qPCR. RFC mRNA steady-state levels were ∼ 9 -fold higher (N =  39; P< 0. 0001) in bladder tumor specimens relative to normal bladder mRNA. RFC upregulation was strongly correlated with tumor type (urothelial vs. non-urothelial; p< 0. 05) where median RFC mRNA expression was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the urothelial (∼ 14 -fold) compared to the non-urothelial (∼ 4 -fold) variant. This may account for the variation in response to antifolate-containing regimens used in the treatment of either type. RFC mRNA levels were not associated with tumor grade (I, II and III) or stage (muscle-invasive vs. non-muscle invasive) implying that RFC cannot be used for prognostic purposes in bladder carcinomas and its increased expression is an early event in human bladder <b>tumors</b> <b>pathogenesis.</b> Further, RFC can be considered as a potential marker for predicting response to antifolate chemotherapy in urothelial carcinomas...|$|R

Only {{little is}} known about mechanisms underlying pituitary <b>tumor</b> <b>pathogenesis.</b> We searched for a side population (SP) in pituitary tumor, representing cells with high efflux capacity and potentially enriching for tumor stem cells (TSC). Human pituitary adenomas contain a SP irrespective of hormonal phenotype. This adenoma SP, as well as the purified SP (pSP) depleted from endothelial and immune cells, enriches for cells that express 'tumor stemness' markers and signaling pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) -linked factors. Pituitary adenomas were found to contain self-renewing sphere-forming cells, considered a property of TSC. These sphere-initiating cells were recovered in the pSP. Because benign pituitary adenomas do not grow in vitro and failed to expand in immunodeficient mice, the pituitary tumor cell line AtT 20 was further used. We identified a SP in this cell line and found it more tumorigenic than the non-SP 'main population'. Of the two EMT-regulatory pathways tested, inhibition of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (Cxcr 4) signaling reduced EMT-associated cell motility in vitro as well as xenograft tumor growth, whereas activation of TGFβ had no effect. The adenoma pSP also showed upregulated expression of the pituitary stem cell marker SOX 2. Pituitaries from dopamine receptor D 2 knockout (Drd 2 -/-) mice bearing prolactinomas, contain more pSP, Sox 2 + and colony-forming cells than wildtype glands. In conclusion, we detected a SP in pituitary tumor and identified TSC-associated characteristics.
