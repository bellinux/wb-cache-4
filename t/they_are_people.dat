[...] Clarke also notes that songs like [...] "Nelly Was a Lady" [...] describe the black experience as ordinary human feelings; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> as real as the characters in Shakespeare.|$|E
500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people...</b> I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If I looked at it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E

[...] 39% of respondents said, [...] "Yes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> with valid medical needs, like infertile couples" [...] and 35% said, [...] "Why not?

Portuguese seafarers arrived in Goa in 1510, and Catholic missionary activities soon followed, as Pope Nicholas V had enacted the Papal bull Romanus Pontifex in 1455, which granted the patronage of the propagation of the Christian faith in Asia to the Portuguese.|$|E

2500|$|Davos men {{supposedly}} {{see their}} identity {{as a matter of}} personal choice, not an accident of birth. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the phrase [...] "Davos Man", <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> who [...] "have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations". In his 2004 article [...] "Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{are urged}} to {{minimize}} their social contact with non-members, even if they possess [...] "decent qualities", because of perceived dangers of worldly association. Sociologist Andrew Holden indicated they are highly selective in choosing with whom they spend leisure time, generally choosing the company of other Witnesses. Many Witnesses interviewed by Holden reported tensions and ostracism at work because of their religious beliefs. He reported that many Jehovah's Witness converts required some social adjustment as they gradually reduced contact with non-Witness friends. Association with those outside the organization, commonly termed by Witnesses as [...] "worldly" [...] and [...] "not in the Truth", is acceptable only when it is viewed {{as an opportunity to}} preach and Witnesses are under considerable pressure from the Society to show outsiders <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> of high moral fiber. Holden claims that as a result, Witnesses working with [...] "worldly" [...] colleagues tend to closely adhere to Watch Tower teachings.|$|E
2500|$|Connectors are {{the people}} in a {{community}} who know {{large numbers of people}} and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> who [...] "link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together". They are [...] "a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [...] making friends and acquaintances". Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the [...] "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" [...] trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person who understands the concept of the weak tie. Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that [...] "their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy".|$|E

2500|$|The British writer Peter Fleming visited Manchukuo in 1935, {{and while}} riding a train through the {{countryside}} of Manchukuo, a group of Japanese colonists mistook his Swiss girlfriend Kini for a Russian refugee, and began to beat her up. It was only after Fleming was able {{to prove to the}} Japanese that his girlfriend was Swiss, not Russian, that the Japanese stopped and apologized, saying that they would never had beaten her up if they had known she was Swiss, saying that they sincerely believed she was a Russian when they assaulted her. Fleming observed that in Manchukuo: [...] "you can beat White Russians up till you are blue in the face, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> without status in the world, citizens of nowhere". Fleming further noted that the Japanese in Manchukuo had a strong dislike of all white people, and because the Russians in Manchukuo were stateless without an embassy to issue protests if they were victimized, the Japanese liked to victimize them. Until World War II, the Japanese tended to leave alone those travelling to Manchukuo with a passport as they did not like to deal with protests from embassies in Tokyo about the mistreatment of their citizens. The Kwantung Army operated a secret biological-chemical warfare unit based in Pinfang, Unit 731, that performed gruesome experiments on people involving much visceration of the subjects to see the effects of chemicals and germs on the human body. In the late 1930s, the doctors of Unit 731 demanded more white subjects to experiment upon in order to test the efficiency the strains of anthrax and plague that they were developing leading to a great many of the Russians living in Manchukuo becoming the unwilling human guinea pigs of Unit 731. The Russian Fascist Party, which worked with the Japanese was used to kidnap various [...] "unreliable" [...] Russians living in Manchukuo for Unit 731 to experiment upon.|$|E
