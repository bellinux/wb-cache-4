40|$|Developed {{fractures}} are {{beneficial for}} the efficient development of tight reservoir. They also lead <b>to</b> <b>drill-in</b> fluid loss and induce severe formation damage. Fracture plugging with loss control material (LCM) {{is the most}} common way to control drill-in fluid loss in fractured formation. Fracture plugging effect largely depends on the strength of fracture plugging zone, because in most cases plugging failure is caused by the strength failure of plugging zone. However, the effects of LCM mechanical and geometric parameters on plugging zone strength are still unclear. Moreover, traditional LCM selection is mainly performed by trial-and-error method, {{due to the lack of}} mathematical models. This paper develops an analytical model for plugging zone strength accounting for the frictional failure and shear failure of fracture plugging zone. Effects of LCM mechanical and geometric properties on plugging zone strength are analyzed. The proposed model is validated by laboratory data. Application procedure of the proposed model <b>to</b> <b>drill-in</b> fluid loss control is developed and successfully applied to the field case study in Sichuan basin, China. The modelling results show that particle-particle friction angle, particle-fiber friction angle, fiber tensile strength, D 90 degradation rate, and friction angle between plugging zone and fracture surface are main mechanical parameters affecting the plugging zone strength. Particle size distribution, aspect ratio and initial angle of fiber, and plugging zone porosity are main geometric parameters during loss control. Single LCM parameters are applied to the selection of LCM type. Plugging zone parameters are used for the determination of optimal LCM concentration. Reasonable combination of rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle can create a synergy effect to optimize the plugging zone strength and loss control effect.

40|$|Drill-in fluids (DIF) are {{relatively}} clean compared to conventional mud systems and {{are designed to}} minimize the effects of drilling fluid damage when drilling through the pay zone. Drill-in fluids are typically formulated to deposit a high quality, relatively impermeable filter cake, which seals the wellbore and minimizes fluid leak off into the formation. In theory, such cakes maybe removed by the produced fluids and from sufficient drawdown in the production direction. Typically, {{the part of the}} wellbore that has been exposed <b>to</b> the <b>drill-in</b> fluid for the longest period is the most damaged. If left in place, the filter cake can significantly reduce the production rate of the well, cause a poor production profile and reduce the efficiency of the completion. Production complications such as gas or water coning can also arise. Water-based DIF comprised of carbonate particles and polymers are widely used in the industry. Calcium carbonate particles act as a weighting and bridging agent whereas polymers such as starch and xanthan provide appropriate rheological properties to the DIF. Such DIF forms filter cakes containing carbonate, polymers and rock fines arising from drilling...|$|R
30|$|The {{drilling}} fluid {{should be designed}} to form impermeable filter cake on the formation face to minimize the formation damage. Sag tendency of the weighting material (Nguyen et al. 2011) should be avoided by using the proper additives. The rheological properties of the {{drilling fluid}}s play key factor in the drilling operations. It is recommended to add additives such as blast furnace slag (BFS) to reduce the spurt loss and form a good filter cake (Nandurdikar et al. 2002). Formation damage can be repaired and prevented by adding microemulsion additives to the drilling fluids (Abdo and Haneef 2012). Nanoparticles addition to the drilling fluid enhanced the rheological properties of the drilling fluid (Penny et al. 2005). Nanomaterials are those materials that have an average particle size of 1 – 100  nm with a very high {{surface to volume ratio}} (Amanullah and Al-Tahini 2009). Because of the huge surface area of the nanoparticles, it {{can be used as a}} fluid loss control, shale inhibitor, and for rheology control when added <b>to</b> the <b>drill-in</b> fluid with a small concentration (Amanullah and Al-Abdullatif 2010). The main idea is that the nanoparticles will provide good sealing at the early stage of filtration and will form thin and impermeable filter cake, which will prevent more filtration to the formation and reduce the formation damage.|$|R
