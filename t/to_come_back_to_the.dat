5|$|In 2008, the Dutch Champions AZ Alkmaar {{approached}} Jess to {{join them}} and become the first overseas player in the Eredivisie. Jess won back to back league titles during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, and were on track to defend a third title during the 2010/2011 season when she left <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E

Charlie is astonished and grateful, and asks if Don has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola. Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself.|$|E
5|$|Transition {{and poor}} play marked the mid- to late-1970s. Though Collier agreed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns as a quarterbacks coach on an {{informal}} basis, his retirement severed the last direct link to Brown and the team's early years. Meanwhile, {{a new generation}} of players began to replace the old hands who kept Cleveland in playoff contention through most of the 1960s. Gene Hickerson, an anchor on the offensive line in the 1960s, retired {{at the end of the}} 1973 season. An aging Leroy Kelly left the same year to play in the short-lived World Football League. Offensive lineman Dick Schafrath, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, retired in 1971.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent {{at the end of the}} 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
5|$|Kate {{is upset}} about Sawyer not wanting her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach {{with him to}} rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is {{defending}} Sawyer, Jack informs Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches {{him in the face}} repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.|$|E

25|$|Special {{relativity}} also {{predicts that}} two light rays traveling {{in opposite directions}} around a spinning closed path (e.g. a loop) require different flight times <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moving emitter/receiver (this {{is a consequence of}} the independence of the speed of light from the velocity of the source, see above). This effect was actually observed and is called the Sagnac effect. Currently, the consideration of this effect is necessary for many experimental setups and for the correct functioning of GPS.|$|E
25|$|Two centuries later, the {{well-known}} Ottoman itinerant Evliya Çelebi gave {{a list of}} groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray and Çarşamba, bear {{the names of the}} places of origin of their inhabitants. However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmed allowed the deported Greeks <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles writes {{in the middle of the}} 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed into mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total.|$|E

25|$|A very frail Ethel {{returns to}} Albert Square in 2000, {{arriving}} unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel {{had run away}} from her retirement village and had decided {{that she was going}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> square, to live in the place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E
25|$|The series {{describes}} the various trials of Miaka Yūki and Yui Hongo, two middle-school students. While {{at the library}} one day, Miaka and Yui encounter a strange book known as The Universe of the Four Gods. Reading this book transports them into the novel's universe in ancient China. Yui is transported back {{to the real world}} almost immediately, but Miaka finds herself the Priestess of Suzaku. Miaka is destined to gather the seven Celestial Warriors of the god Suzaku in order to summon Suzaku and obtain three wishes. She falls in love with the Celestial Warrior Tamahome, who eventually reciprocates and Miaka's desire to use a wish to enter the high school of her choice begins to shift towards finding a way to be with Tamahome. Yui is also drawn into the book when she tries to help Miaka <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real world; becoming the Priestess of Seiryuu, working against Miaka out of jealousy over Tamahome and revenge for the humiliation and pain she had suffered when she first came to into the book's world.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, {{a beautifully}} attired Nastassya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastassya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not {{particularly}} surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day, he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastassya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of 2010, Hingis {{defeated}} former world number one Lindsay Davenport, and hinted at a possible return to tennis. In February, she announced having committed to a full season with the World TeamTennis Tour in 2010. She had previously played for World Team Tennis in 2005 to assist her first comeback. Sparking thoughts that she was trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> WTA tour, she committed to playing at the Nottingham Masters. On 5 May 2010, {{it was announced that}} Hingis would reunite with her doubles partner Anna Kournikova. Kournikova was participating in competitive tennis {{for the first time in}} seven years, in the Invitational Ladies Doubles event at Wimbledon. Hingis also confirmed that she would play at the Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International championship in June 2010, preceding Wimbledon, before playing in the Manchester Masters after Wimbledon. Liverpool like the Nottingham and Manchester Masters are organised by her management company Northern Vision. At the Nottingham Masters, Hingis faced Michaëlla Krajicek (twice), Olga Savchuk and Monika Wejnert. Hingis won just once in the event, against Wejnert. After the Nottingham event Billie Jean King stated that she believed that Hingis may return to the WTA Tour on the doubles circuit, after competing in the WTT.|$|E
500|$|The burghers and noblemen of Antioch rose {{up against}} Raymond-Roupen. Their leader, William Farabel, persuaded Bohemond <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town.

Constantine immediately declined the offer with a four-letter refusal and wrote [...] "No fucking way" [...] on the letter she had received. Her personal assistant, who was left to deal with the situation, wrongly sent the original letter of invitation (containing Constantine's hand-written note) back to the school. The school then wrote a letter back, stating that she is not welcome near the school.|$|E

The judges moved back from Windsor to sit in Westminster Hall, although Parliament, which had been prorogued in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes.
