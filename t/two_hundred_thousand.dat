After the Seven Years' War, {{the size of}} the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311men in arms in 1761 to 163,613in 1775. In preparing for a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from 195,108effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555men in arms in Spring 1779.

5|$|Though {{the early}} revolts in Kaga failed, unrest {{continued}} in the province, as the Ikkō-ikki would refuse to pay taxes and even seize tax revenues and land, despite Rennyo's admonitions of submission to the authorities. In 1487, possibly {{in an effort to}} secure a favor in the form of military aid, Masachika responded to shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa's call for military aid against Rokkaku Tokoyori in Ōmi Province. In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki launched a massive revolt, their forces numbering between one hundred thousand and <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand.</b> Though Masachika quickly returned, the rebels, aided by several disgruntled former vassal families and nobility, overwhelmed him and trapped him in his castle, where he committed seppuku.|$|E
5|$|The Kaga Rebellion or Chōkyō Uprising was a {{large-scale}} revolt in Kaga Province (present-day southern Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored {{to power in}} 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan {{as well as the}} Ikkō-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikkō-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one hundred thousand and <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> Ikkō-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikkō-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades the Ikkō-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{previous}} revolts having been easily suppressed, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika's governance. The Ikkō-ikki {{who remained in}} Kaga grew bolder, refusing to pay taxes and even seizing tax revenue and land, despite Rennyo's continued protestations. In 1487, Masachika left with a large army for Ōmi Province {{in response to a}} call for aid from shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori. In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki, led by Rengo, Renkō, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, launched their revolt and between one hundred thousand and <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> members took up arms. Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and defeated the rebels in several battles. However, several vassal families, discontent with Masachika, joined with the rebels. The rebels cut off Masachika from reinforcements from his allies in the bordering Echizen, Etchū, and Noto Provinces, and besieged his castle. Masachika, trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, committed seppuku. In his place, the vassal families who rebelled against Masachika put forward his uncle and ex-shugo, Yasutaka, as a candidate to be the new shugo.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} clear that other monarchs were not going to acquiesce to a de facto {{partition}} of Bavaria, Joseph and his foreign minister, Anton von Kaunitz, scoured the Habsburg realm for troops and concentrated six hundred guns and a 180,000–190,000-man Austrian army in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. This amounted to most of Austria's <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> effectives, leaving much of the Habsburg border regions with the Ottoman Empire under-guarded. On 6 April 1778, Frederick of Prussia established his army of eighty thousand men on the Prussian border with Bohemia, near Neisse, Schweidnitz, and the County of Glatz, which Frederick had acquired from the Wittelsbach contender in 1741 in exchange for his electoral support of Charles VII. At Glatz, Frederick completed his preparations for invasion: he gathered supplies, arranged a line of march, brought up his artillery and drilled his soldiers. His younger brother, Prince Henry, formed a second army of seventy-five to a hundred thousand men to the north and west, in Saxony. In April, Frederick and Joseph officially joined their armies in the field, and diplomatic negotiations ended.|$|E
