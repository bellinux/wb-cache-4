40|$|The Multilayer <b>Transient</b> <b>Test</b> is a well-testing {{technique}} {{designed to}} determine formation properties in multiple layers, {{and it has been}} proved effective during the past two decades. To apply the Multilayer <b>Transient</b> <b>Test,</b> a combination of rate profiles from production logs and transient rate and pressure measurements are required at multiple surface rates. Therefore, this method can be time consuming and may involve significant errors due to inaccurate transient flow rate measurements. A new testing approach is proposed after realizing the limitations of the Multilayer <b>Transient</b> <b>Test.</b> The new testing approach replaces the transient flow rate measurement with transient temperature measurement by using multiple temperature sensors. This research shows that formation properties can be quantified in multiple layers by analyzing measured transient temperature and pressure data. A single-phase wellbore/reservoir coupled thermal model is developed as the forward model. The forward model is used to simulate the temperature and pressure response along the wellbore during the <b>transient</b> <b>test.</b> With the forward model, this work proves that the transient temperature and pressure are sufficiently sensitive to formation properties and can be used for multilayer reservoir characterization. The inverse model is formulated by incorporating the forward model to solve formation properties using nonlinear least-square regression. For the hypothetical cases, the proposed new multilayer testing method has successfully been applied for investigating formation properties in commingled multilayer reservoirs. Layer permeability, damaged permeability, and damaged radius can be uniquely determined using single-point transient pressure data and multipoint transient temperature data at appropriate locations. Due to the proposed data acquisition scheme, only one surface flow rate change is needed to implement this testing approach, which significantly reduces the test duration compared to the standard multilayer transient testing approach using a series of flow rate changes. Of special interest, this is the first test design that shows promise for determination of the damaged radius, which can be useful for well stimulation design. In addition, temperature resolution, data noise, and data rate impacts have been studied along with a data filtering approach that enable selection of suitable pressure and temperature sensor technologies for applying the new testing method...|$|E

40|$|Radon {{transient}} {{analysis is}} being developed as a method complementary to pressure transient analysis for evaluation of geothermal reservoirs. The method {{is based on the}} observations of Stoker and Kruger (1975) that radon concentration in produced geothermal fluids is related to geothermal reservoir type, production flow rates, and time. Stoker and Kruger showed that radon concentrations were markedly different in vapor-dominated and liquid-dominated systems, and varied not only among wells of different flow rate in an individual reservoir, but also varied timewise in individual wells. The potential uses of radon as an internal tracer for geothermal reservoir engineering were reviewed by Kruger, Stoker, and Umana (1977). Also included were results of the first <b>transient</b> <b>test</b> performed with rapid flow rate change in a vapor-dominated field. The results of the next four radon-flow rate transient experiments were summarized by Kruger (1978) in which effects of well interference and startup production in a new well were demonstrated. Four of these first five radon transient experiments have been carried out in vapor-dominated reservoirs at The Geysers in California and Serrazzano in Italy. The systematics of the transients of radon concentration following abrupt changes in flow rate is being evaluated by Warren and Kruger (1978). The fifth test was at the HGP-A well in Hawaii, the first <b>transient</b> <b>test</b> in a liquid-dominated reservoir. Three additional radon transient tests have been carried out, each in a different type of geothermal resource. The first test was in a petrothermal resource, the reservoir created by hydraulic fracturing by LASL in the hot, dry rock experiment in New Mexico. The results of this first 75 -day production test of continuous forced circulation, during January-April, 1978, are given by Tester, et al (1978). The results of the radon concentration measurements made during this test are summarized by Kruger, Cederberg, and Semprini (1978).
