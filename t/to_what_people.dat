25|$|Like Mongkut, Ajaan Mun {{stressed}} the importance of scrupulous observance of both the Buddhist monastic code (Pali: Vinaya). Ajaan Mun went further, and also stressed what are called the protocols: instructions for how a monk should go about daily activities such as keeping his hut, interacting with other people, etc.Ajaan Mun also taught that virtue was a matter of the mind, and that intention forms the essence of virtue. This ran counter <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> in Bangkok said at the time, that virtue was a matter of ritual, and by conducting the proper ritual one gets good results.|$|E
25|$|In March 2001, 40 multi-national {{pharmaceutical}} companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, {{despite the fact}} that these drugs were on-patent. HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland's head, Jeff Zycinski, {{stated that}} the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in {{undermining}} celebrities, including Winehouse. He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: [...] "If you play [...] music to a certain demographic, those same {{people want to know}} what's happening in her private life.

Many variations of how she was created exist, but one consistent theme is that her ghost appears in many hospitals, though mainly in the metropolitan areas, especially in Mexico City.|$|E

Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt.

2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq.

So compared <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished.
