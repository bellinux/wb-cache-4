50|$|Detailed {{designs and}} {{blueprints}} {{were prepared for}} both options. The study recommended {{the selection of the}} <b>twin-hull</b> due to the higher service frequency achievable (due to the <b>twin-hull's</b> faster speed of 18 knots versus 14.5 knots), however the study noted that other than this, there was relatively little difference between the options. The <b>twin-hull</b> was designed with dimensions of 63 m length, 12.8 m beam, and 3.3 m draft, while the monohull design was 67 m length, 11.6 m beam, and 4.27 m draft. The wider beam of the <b>twin-hull</b> design would exceed the limits of the existing wharves at Circular Quay, and necessitate a reconfiguration of the wharves if selected. Burness Corlett were confident that the <b>twin-hull</b> option was the superior choice, due to service speed and stability through Sydney Heads, and so no model tests were performed for the monohull design.|$|R

5000|$|A {{study by}} {{maritime}} consultants Burness Corlett Australia {{was released in}} July 1976. It investigated the requirements of new vessels to replace the North Head and Baragoola by 1978. Various configurations were considered, including conventional monohull, catamaran, hovercraft and hydrofoil. Planing ferries of both single and <b>twin-hull</b> configuration were rejected, as such a configuration cannot be double-ended and therefore would have required berthing stern-first. Hydrofoils were also rejected from consideration due to due to excessive cost and limited passenger capacity. Two options were selected for detailed investigation: monohull and <b>twin-hull,</b> both double ended and having 1,200 passengers capacity.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the characteristic of low and middle frequency underwater noise of a catamaran. Based on acoustic-structure coupling method, the low and middle frequency underwater noise radiation prediction {{model of a}} <b>twin-hull</b> craft is established. The underwater noise radiations excited by both the monohulland double hulls are studied, respectively. Calculation method of underwater noise of <b>twin-hull</b> craft is also discussed. Study shows that the behaviours of underwater noise radiation of a catamaran {{is quite different from}} a single hull ship. Due to the existence of free surface and twin hulls of the craft, the underwater sound radiation varies especially in the near field -. The sound directivity changes severely when standing wave appears between the region of twin hulls if the distance of bilateral hulls and sound wave length satisfies certain conditions at certain frequencies. However, if the standing wave effects do not occur between twin hulls the principle of linear superposition is approximately satisfied...|$|R
50|$|Multihulls feature reduced {{roll and}} yaw (equivalent pitch motion) with {{transverse}} stability (depends on transverse clearance) comparable to {{or greater than}} longitudinal stability. This reduced motion reduces seasickness and allows for more efficient solar energy collection and radar operation. They offer more effective motion mitigation systems (SWA ships), reduced wave resistance and towing resistance by controlling hull aspect ratio (for <b>twin-hulls)</b> and optimizing the interference between each hull's wave systems (triple-hulls).|$|R

50|$|In 1888, regular {{steamship}} service commenced on {{the lower}} Columbia after entrepreneurs J. Frederick Hume, William Cowan, and Robert Sanderson formed the Columbia Transportation Company.

In 1947 he designed the Manu Kai ("Sea Bird"), which was built by the Hawaiian Alfred Kumalai,and Rudy Choy. It was probably the fastest sailing boat in the world at the time and now seen as the first modern, ocean-going catamaran.|$|E
25|$|The HK-1 {{contract}} was issued in 1942 as a development contract {{and called for}} three aircraft to be constructed in two years for the war effort. Seven configurations were considered, including <b>twin-hull</b> and single-hull designs with combinations of four, six, and eight wing-mounted engines. The final design chosen was a behemoth, eclipsing any large transport then built. It would be built mostly of wood to conserve metal (its elevators and rudder were fabric-covered), and was nicknamed the Spruce Goose (a name Hughes disliked) or the Flying Lumberyard.|$|R
5000|$|Very narrow mono-hull boats such as canoes and kayaks {{have little}} initial stability, but <b>twin-hull</b> W-kayaks are {{considerably}} more stable {{due to the}} fact that their buoyancy is distributed at a greater distance from their center line and therefore acts more effectively to reduce tilting.It is advantageous to keep the centre of gravity as low as possible in small boats so occupants generally sit down at all times. Flatwater rowing shells, which have length to beam ratios of up to 30:1 are inherently unstable and must be actively balanced by the athletes.|$|R
50|$|Hulls with beam {{designs that}} are {{narrower}} {{at the water}} surface (waterplane) than below can be classified as hulls with decreased or small waterplane area. More often the term small waterplane area hull means a hull with an underwater gondola and strut(s) that connect the gondola to the above-water platform. Any ship employing such hulls qualifies. Any <b>twin-hull</b> SWA ship is called a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH). A SWATH with one long strut on each hull is called a duplus (named after the first drilling ship of this type). The duplus {{is the most common}} type of SWA ships built.|$|R
