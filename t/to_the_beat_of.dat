25|$|From the 18th century onward, Wahhabi {{fundamentalism}} discouraged artistic development {{inconsistent with}} its teaching. In addition, Sunni Islamic prohibition of creating representations {{of people have}} limited the visual arts, {{which tend to be}} dominated by geometric, floral, and abstract designs and by calligraphy. With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rabābah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the ṭabl (drum) and the ṭār (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the ʿarḍah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> drums and tambourines. Bedouin poetry, known as nabaṭī, is still very popular.|$|E

Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night".
