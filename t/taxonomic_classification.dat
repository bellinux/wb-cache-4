5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur evolution {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E

25|$|For many decades, {{the precise}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> {{of the giant}} panda was under debate because it shares {{characteristics}} with both bears and raccoons.

The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.|$|E
40|$|Using the Wide Field Camera for the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), {{we measure}} the {{near-infrared}} colors of near-Earth objects (NEOs) {{in order to}} put constraints on their <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications.</b> The rapid-response character of our observations allows us to observe NEOs when they are close to the Earth and bright.

Using machine-learning methods, we compare our measurements to existing asteroid spectral data and provide probabilistic <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications</b> for our targets. Our observations allow us to distinguish between S-complex, C/X-complex, D-type, and V-type asteroids.

25|$|Dicraeosaurid {{specimens}} {{have been}} found in three continents - Africa, South America, and North America. The distribution of species is primarily Gondwonan, {{with the exception of the}} North American Suuwassea. The presence of Suuwassea in North America is unique among dicraeosaurids, therefore making the proper <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> of Suuwassea essential. The group likely first diverged from the diplodocids in the middle Jurassic in North America and subsequently dispersed into Gondwana, with the most diversity in East Africa and South America. Amargasaurus was the latest surviving dicraeosaurid genus, living into the Early Cretaceous period.|$|E
25|$|Gray langurs or Hanuman langurs, {{the most}} {{widespread}} langurs of the Indian Subcontinent, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting {{the entirety of the}} genus Semnopithecus (from Ancient Greek σεμνός semnós, “revered, august, holy”, and πίθηκος píthēkos, “ape, monkey”). All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given species status, so that seven species are recognized. A <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.|$|E
25|$|Various {{scientific}} disciplines have developed <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> systems to describe natural phenomena or individuals, like for example, plants or animals. These systems {{are based on}} specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction. Differently, in landslide classification, there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable; usually being characterised by different causes, movements and morphology, and involving genetically different material. For this reason, landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors, sometimes very subjective. In the following write-up, factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups: {{the first one is}} made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined. The second one is formed by those factors that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Thousands of {{different}} microorganisms affect the health, safety, and economic stability of populations. Many different medical and governmental organizations have created {{lists of the}} pathogenic microorganisms relevant to their missions; however, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is inexact. This ambiguity can be a significant block to effective communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks. Results We have developed a database known as the Microbial Rosetta Stone. The database relates microorganism names, <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications,</b> diseases, specific detection and treatment protocols, and relevant literature. The database structure facilitates linkage to public genomic databases. This paper focuses on {{the information in the}} database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents. Conclusion The Microbial Rosetta Stone is available at [URL]. The database provides public access to up-to-date <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications</b> of organisms that cause human diseases, improves the consistency of nomenclature in disease reporting, and provides useful links between different public genomic and public health databases. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{ecological}} classification systems {{is becoming more}} and more widely used when studying phytoplankton. Grouping phytoplankton species into ecologically coherent groups allow to reduce redundancy and in this way, to handle a minor number of biological variables when investigating the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Three ecological classifications are mostly used when freshwater phytoplankton is studied: functional groups or coda, morpho-functional groups (MFGs) and morphologybased functional groups (MBFGs). In this study, these three ecological classifications were comparatively used along with two <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications</b> based on species and genera to analyse phytoplankton response to environmental variability in three subtropical Chinese reservoirs. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to compare the five mentioned biological classifications. When ecological classifications were used, the percentage of variance explained in the biological groups–environmental variables was higher than that explained by the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications.</b> Coda and MFGs showed a very high degree of overlapping, but since coda are associated to very detailed environmental templates, this method was more helpful in explaining phytoplankton variability in relation to environmental factors...|$|R

25|$|The {{pioneering}} {{nature of}} Ricketts' book may be appreciated {{by comparison with}} another classic work, now in its fourth edition, that was published two years later, in 1941: Light's Manual, by S. F. Light, of the University of California, Berkeley. Light's Manual is technical, difficult for laymen, but essential for specialists. On the other hand, Ricketts' Between Pacific Tides is readable, full of observations and side comments, and readily accessible to anyone with a genuine interest in seashore life. It cannot serve as a thorough manual to marine invertebrates, but it addresses the common and conspicuous animals in a style that invites and educates newcomers and offers substantial information for experienced biologists. It is not organized according to <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification,</b> but instead by habitat. Thus, crabs are not all treated in the same chapter; crabs of the rocky shore, high in the intertidal, are in a separate section from crabs of lower intertidal zones or sandy beaches.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomical {{classification}} {{of the glass}} frogs has been problematic. In 1991, after a major revision of the species and taxonomic characters, the herpetologists Pedro Ruiz-Carranza and John D. Lynch published {{a proposal for a}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Centrolenidae based on cladistic principles and defining monophyletic groups. That paper was {{the first of a series}} of contributions dealing with the glass frogs from Colombia that led them to describe almost 50 species of glass frogs. The genus Centrolene was proposed to include the species with a humeral spine in adult males, and the genus Hyalinobatrachium to include the species with a bulbous liver. However, they left a heterogeneous group of species in the genus Cochranella, defined just by lacking a humeral spine and a bulbous liver. Since the publication of the extensive revision of the Colombian glass frogs, several other publications have dealt with the glass frogs from Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.|$|E

40|$|Background. The genus Pachypodium {{contains}} 21 {{species of}} succulent, generally spinescent shrubs and trees found in southern Africa and Madagascar. Pachypodium has diversified mostly into arid and semi-arid habitats of Madagascar, {{and has been}} cited {{as an example of}} a plant group that links the highly diverse arid-adapted floras of Africa and Madagascar. However, a lack of knowledge about phylogenetic relationships within the genus has prevented testing of this and other hypotheses about the group. Methodology/Principal Findings. We use DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F region for all 21 Pachypodium species to reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the genus. We compare phylogenetic results to previous <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications</b> and geography. Results support three infrageneric taxa from the most recent classification of Pachypodium, and suggest that a group of African species (P. namaquanum, P. succulentum and P. bispinosum) may deserve taxonomic recognition as an infrageneric taxon. However, our results do not resolve relationships among major African and Malagasy lineages of the genus. Conclusions/Significance. We present the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of Pachypodium. Our work has revealed five distinct lineages, most of which correspond to groups recognized in past <b>taxonomic</b> <b>classifications.</b> Our work also suggests that there is a complex biogeographic relationship between Pachypodium of Africa and Madagascar...|$|R
