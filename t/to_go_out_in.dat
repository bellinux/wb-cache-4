5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E
5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes {{him to have a}} fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers {{were able to go}} out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time towards the end of the session.|$|E

He kept a low profile in his business operations, and declined comment during John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign when the Keating Five scandal was brought up again by the press. [...] During his final years, Keating maintained good physical shape through swimming and walking and was able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public without being recognized.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the Hogettes {{can be traced to}} October 1983 when Michael Torbert (Mikey T.), founder of the group, went to a Halloween party at his grandmother's {{retirement}} home wearing one of her old dresses as a costume. [...] The costume was such a hit that he gathered a group of men who he [...] "thought were tough enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public in a dress." [...] The group would go to children's hospitals to cheer up sick children. [...] On November 27, 1983, the group attended their first Washington Redskins football game in full drag, but with the addition of pig snout masks, in reference to The Hogs, the nickname of the Redskins offensive line players.|$|E
500|$|While {{visiting the}} United States in 1959, Khrushchev was greatly {{impressed}} by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, [...] "It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning {{to work on the}} collective farms because to do that they'd have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the provinces and live in the sticks." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dance Hall" [...] is styled in {{the genre}} of the same name, and also {{incorporates}} funk. The segue track [...] "Times Squares 2:30 A.M." [...] was recorded by the group {{on the street with}} a tape recorder. [...] "Fun" [...] has a hip hop groove, jazz fusion tone, and irreverent, party theme similar to [...] "Dance Hall". [...] "Anniversary" [...] is about mature, lasting love. Elysa Gardner of Vibe calls it [...] "a grandly romantic, nine-minute bolero that lavishes its female subject with such warmth and respect that the cheeky misogyny of [...] seems instantly forgiveable." [...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony, so I named the song after the choir. One {{of the great things about}} that experience at school was that it got us ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the professional world with our music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E

500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
