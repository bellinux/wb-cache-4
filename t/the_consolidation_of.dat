5|$|The Song navy was {{of great}} {{importance}} during <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> the empire in the 10th century; during {{the war against the}} Southern Tang state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating pontoon bridges across the Yangtze River in order to secure movements of troops and supplies. There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor was based on <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes {{of the people and}} the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is of {{significance}} to determinate <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> state <b>of</b> soil {{for evaluation of}} deformation and strength <b>of</b> foundation soil. <b>The</b> <b>consolidation</b> state <b>of</b> red clay is determined through laboratory experiments combined with static cone penetration tests. The results show that <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> history <b>of</b> red clay is opposite to other soils. The static point resistance obtained from cone penetration test decreases linearly with soil depth increasing. The over-consolidate rate of different soil layer gotten by laboratory experiments also decreases linearly with soil depth increasing. The slopes of two linear regress curves are similar. The change of static point resistance {{can be used to}} estimate over-consolidate rate of red clay at different depth...|$|R

5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
