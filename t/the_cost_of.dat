5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> welding plays {{a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> materials includes <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the base and filler material, and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{health care}} <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> {{population}} ageing are for {{an important part}} attributable to higher mortality rates in combination with high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. This paper answers three questions that remain unanswered regarding <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying: (1) contributions of different health services to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying; (2) variation in <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying; and (3) the influence of preceding health care expenses on <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. We retrieved data on 61, 495 Dutch subjects aged 65 and older from July 2007 through 2010 from a regional health care insurer. We included all deceased subjects of whom health care expenses were known for 26 months prior to death (n ¼ 2833). <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> dying were defined as health care expenses {{made in the last}} six months before death. Lorenz curves, generalized linear models and a two-part model were used for our analyses. (1) <b>The</b> average <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying are V 25, 919. Medical care contributes to 57 % of this total, and long-term care 43 %. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying mainly relate to hospital care (40 %). (2) In <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, 75 % is attributable to the costliest half of the population. For medical care, this distribution figure is 86 %, and for long-term care 92 %. Age and preceding expenses are significant determinants of this variation in <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. (3) Overall, higher preceding health care expenses are associated with higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying are higher for those with a longer patient history. To summarize, there is not a large variation in <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, but there are large differences in <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> these <b>costs.</b> Before death, <b>the</b> oldest old utilize more long-term care while their younger counterparts visit hospitals more often.

40|$|Objective: Although the {{clinical}} relevance of minor depression {{has been demonstrated}} in many studies, <b>the</b> economic <b>costs</b> are not well explored. In this study, we examine <b>the</b> economic <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression. Method: In a large-scale, population-based study in the Netherlands (n = 5504) <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression were compared with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression and dysthymia. Excess <b>costs,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a disorder over and above <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> attributable to other illnesses, were estimated with help of regression analysis. <b>The</b> direct medical <b>costs,</b> <b>the</b> direct non-medical <b>costs</b> and <b>the</b> indirect non-medical <b>costs</b> were calculated. <b>The</b> year 2003 {{was used as the}} reference year. Results: The annual per capita excess <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression were US$ 2141 (95 % CI = 753 - 3529) higher than <b>the</b> base rate <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> US$ 1023, while <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression were US$ 3313 (95 % CI = 1234 - 5390) higher than the base rate. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression per 1 million inhabitants were 160 million dollars per year, which is somewhat less than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression (192 million dollars per year).
