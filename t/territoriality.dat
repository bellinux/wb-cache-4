5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, <b>territoriality</b> is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and <b>territoriality</b> at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, <b>territoriality</b> was observed for less than four months.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of <b>territoriality,</b> as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, <b>territoriality,</b> feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
30|$|Despite this {{evidence}} for the efficiency of pastoralism over sedentary livestock breeding and despite a certain willingness of policy makers to preserve pastoralists’ <b>territorialities</b> with the settlement of stock routes, livestock is increasingly being herded in local territories. FulBe’s and farmers-herders’ <b>territorialities</b> thus co-exist at the local scale.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{identified}} the main links {{in the chain of}} causality that has led to FulBe <b>territorialities</b> being challenged at regional and local scales. We have argued that, despite scientific and economic evidence for the efficiency of pastoralism, all the rural development policies since the colonial era and even during the Sankara anti-colonialist period have always favoured sedentary herding, with livestock confined to small strictly controlled areas. We have demonstrated that these policies have three territorial consequences: (1) the livestock territories that were created by the state to facilitate herd mobility are now usually controlled by farmer-herders; (2) at local scale, the <b>territorialities</b> of permanently settled farmers who capitalize on livestock are reinforced despite the fact that their herding action space extends beyond the boundary of their village territory; and (3) at the regional scale, these policies weaken pastoralists’ reticular <b>territorialities,</b> which are based on socio-spatial relations built up with farmers to acquire and secure access to water, pastures and stock routes between the anchored pastoral territories.|$|R
30|$|The {{creation}} of local livestock territories is thus likely to fail. Although the policy {{has not yet}} been implemented, and will be very difficult to implement, attempts to apply it already have consequences for herders’ <b>territorialities.</b>|$|R
5|$|Infanticide {{exists in}} {{numerous}} rodent species {{and may be}} practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, {{in the case of}} males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, <b>territoriality</b> or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} {{has been linked to}} sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express <b>territoriality,</b> as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and <b>territoriality.</b> The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} different uses of territory {{in the context of}} events, which are associated with the carnival, in São Paulo city. Given the different territorial uses by the Sambistas, there was a connection between the theory and the field work that achieved a critical explanation of the <b>territorialities</b> in the " world of Samba " and focused on a problem that involves both territory and culture. In this sense, the mechanisms through which the Samba occupy social practices and subjective representations became evident; they act as if " against-finality. " All of these practices benefit experiences and leisure over the whole year, not only at Carnival; they also structure sociability nets that generate <b>territorialities</b> in an essentially collective sense...|$|R
30|$|The {{information}} gathered from reports {{and interviews with}} experts was crossed checked {{with the results of}} our analysis of satellite images, with the information we collected during workshops and interviews with producers and field observations to ensure accurate assessment of herders’ <b>territorialities</b> and the impact that policies have had on them.|$|R
5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict <b>territoriality</b> of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of <b>territoriality</b> refers to linguistic rights being focused solely within a territory, whereas the {{principle of}} personality depends on the linguistic status of the person(s) involved. An example of the application of <b>territoriality</b> {{is the case of}} Switzerland, where linguistic rights are defined within clearly divided language-based cantons. An example of the application of personality is in federal Canadian legislation, which grants the right to services in French or English regardless of territory.|$|E

30|$|Land {{tenure and}} rural {{development}} policies have jeopardized mobile herders’ <b>territorialities</b> since Independence.

30|$|Dansero and Puttilli (2014) {{suggested}} {{the existence of}} multiple <b>territorialities</b> of alternative food networks. Alternative economic networks involve heterogeneous activities (Ofstehage 2012). Alternative economy involves heterogeneous practices, which in turn enables {{us to see the}} material, cultural, and subjective impacts of these heterogeneous organizational forms (Bergeron and Healy 2013). Multiple heterogeneous economies coexist in the larger context of the informal economy within a country (Bureau and Fendt 2011).|$|R

25|$|Both steppe {{and forest}} species are territorial, though <b>territoriality</b> varies between species from being {{characteristic}} {{only during the}} breeding season, to being territorial throughout the year. When defending their territories from conspecifics, tinamous are highly vocal, creating a cacophony of sound. When an intruder is noticed, birds {{of the same sex}} will confront it. This may lead to conflict, with feet and wings being used in attack. Both males and females will defend their territories; however, in each species only one sex is fiercely territorial.|$|E
25|$|After {{the reign}} of Leovigild, the {{legislation}} of the Visigoths underwent a transformation. New laws made by the kings were declared to be applicable to all subjects in the kingdom, of whatever race; in other words, they became territorial; and this principle of <b>territoriality</b> was gradually extended to the ancient code. Moreover, the conversion of Reccared (586-601) from Arianism to orthodox Christianity effaced the religious differences among his subjects, and all subjects, being Christians, had {{to submit to the}} canons of the councils, made obligatory by the kings.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} {{systemic}} agriculture {{coincided with the}} introduction of a new social system called feudalism. This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations. Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latter's protection. This made for confusion of territorial sovereignty since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory. Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records. Even land ownership disputes were decided based solely on oral testimony. <b>Territoriality</b> was reduced to a network of personal allegiances.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} challenges – as {{does the}} book as a whole – a unified and closed conceptualization of Milan meant as Milan municipality, a set and limited jurisdictional level. This chapter will help to highlight the growing integration processes and contentious <b>territorialities</b> that renovate the transscalar relationship between the Milan urban region and Milan municipal area. The socio-spatial effects of urbanization don’t just weaken with distance from the centre to some outer boundary.

This activity aims at seizing economic, social or political opportunities that are relevant for the external actor (e. g. : enterprises, international development organizations, NGOs, political actors). We will stress the elements that make up the dynamic field of relationships between the actors and the forms taken by the <b>territorialities</b> involved. We will focus on intra-local and inter-local relations, either descendants or ascendants...|$|R
30|$|To {{fill the}} gap {{concerning}} territorial impacts, we conducted a field survey in western Burkina Faso, where farmer-herders and FulBe pastoralists have difficulty for the cohabitation of their activities at both local and regional scale. After reviewing policy discourses and official reports since the colonial era and analysing the data from our field study, we notice that livestock and land tenure laws and policies have dramatic territorial consequences, in particular the territorial marginalization of pastoralists, and threaten mobile herding <b>territorialities</b> even when their explicit goal was to reinforce them {{with the creation of}} state livestock territories (areas or stock routes).|$|R
25|$|Stoat <b>territoriality</b> has a {{generally}} mustelid spacing pattern, with male territories encompassing smaller female territories, which they defend from other males. The {{size of the}} territory and the ranging behaviour of its occupants varies seasonally, depending on the abundance of food and mates. During the breeding season, the ranges of females remain unchanged, while males either become roamers, strayers or transients. Dominant older males have territories 50 times larger than those of younger, socially inferior males. Both sexes mark their territories with urine, faeces and two types of scent marks; anal drags are meant to convey territorial occupancy, and body rubbing is associated with agonistic encounters.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, a study {{proposed}} that immediate human ancestors and wolves may have domesticated {{each other through}} a strategic alliance that would change both respectively into humans and dogs. The effects of human psychology, hunting practices, <b>territoriality</b> and social behavior would have been profound. Wolves and dogs mark their territory with scent; however, humans {{do not have a}} keen sense of smell and may have begun to mark their territories with symbols, which became the first art and may have been generative of human culture. Wolves hunt large game; however, {{there is no evidence of}} pre-sapiens hunting large game. Early humans moved from scavenging and small-game hunting to big-game hunting by living in larger, socially more-complex groups, learning to hunt in packs, and developing powers of cooperation and negotiation in complex situations. As these are characteristics of wolves, dogs and humans, it can be argued that these behaviors were enhanced once wolves and humans began to cohabit. Communal hunting led to communal defense. Wolves actively patrol and defend their scent-marked territory, and perhaps humans had their sense of <b>territoriality</b> enhanced by living with wolves. One of the keys to recent human survival has been the forming of partnerships. Strong bonds exist between same-sex wolves, dogs and humans and these bonds are stronger than exist between other same-sex animal pairs. Today, the most widespread form of inter-species bonding occurs between humans and dogs. The concept of friendship has ancient origins but it may have been enhanced through the inter-species relationship to give a survival advantage.|$|E
25|$|The Australian painted lady's {{mating system}} evolved {{due to a}} highly {{dispersed}} female population. Food and oviposition sites are abundant as females feed {{on a wide range}} of host plants; therefore, females do not cluster around hotspots of resources. This tendency makes it impossible for a male to defend the entirety of a female's range. Therefore, the best strategy for males is to defend a territory in which females are likely to travel. Females generally only visit male territories when they are receptive, with the purpose of copulating. However, when an abundant food source attracts a significant number of females, males no longer exhibit <b>territoriality,</b> and are seen searching for mates in areas where females are clustered.|$|E

Taking indigenous children as a reference, or rather, the agents that produce knowledge within the context of their particularities and <b>territorialities,</b> the essay points to the necessity of constructing new theoretical bases and a pedagogy that gives visibility to other local epistemic logics produced by “power coloniality”. They are different from the dominant Western logic in the process of training indigenous educators...|$|R
