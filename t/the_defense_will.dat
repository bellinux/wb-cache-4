25|$|On September 20, 2016 it was {{revealed}} that one of the 13 witnesses whom Prosecutor Steele wants to call in the criminal trial is alleged Cosby victim Margie Shapiro. Allred filed a motion in the civil case of Huth vs. Cosby, to have the deposition of Shapiro postponed until after the criminal trial. Allred stated she believes <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> try to use the deposition against Shapiro to find discrepancies in the upcoming criminal trial. Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa is opposing this motion. The Judge in the civil case is expected to rule on November 4 on whether or not the deposition will take place.|$|E

In Part II of this Comment each of <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> be applied separately to the facts of a recent antitrust case, In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation. Finally, in Part III, {{the application of the}} separatist approach to those facts will be critiqued, and an alternative approach to <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|But if {{everyone}} runs their pattern and does their job, <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> never matter to me. Because someone {{will always be}} open and we'll {{always be able to}} move the ball. It's easy. - Houston Gamblers Quarterback Jim Kelly in 1985 ...|$|R

50|$|Intentional {{grounding}} {{where the}} spot of enforcement {{is in the}} end zone will no longer result in an automatic safety. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> have the option to take the result of the play or the safety.|$|E

50|$|There {{were few}} bright {{points for the}} Sooners after half-time in this {{installment}} of the Red River Rivalry. Though they held the Longhorns to only a single offensive yard in the second quarter, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> gave up two big pass plays on Texas' first series of the third, including a 33-yard touchdown pass to Limas Sweed that broke <b>the</b> <b>defense's</b> <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> offense seemed equally under-motivated in the second half, going three-and-out on their opening drive. Oklahoma also committed numerous turnovers in the second half, including a bad lateral pass that turned into a Texas touchdown, and two interceptions of quarterback Paul Thompson.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> {{not apply}} if the {{employee}} can demonstrate that an alternative employment practice exists {{that would serve}} the same business purpose without producing a pay differential and the employer has refused to adopt the alternative.|$|E
5000|$|To tag out the base-runner. Sometimes {{the runner}} will {{run on the}} first move of the pitcher. If the pitcher {{successfully}} throws {{the ball to the}} base before the base-runner is able to return to it, then <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> be able to tag out the runner.|$|E
50|$|Before the game, many {{linesmen}} {{attach a}} piece of tape at {{the midpoint of the}} chain. The linesman can compare the line of scrimmage to this mark {{at the start of a}} play and know whether a 5-yard penalty against <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> result in a first down.|$|E
50|$|In ice hockey, {{a leading}} team may pass the puck to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> who <b>will</b> then retreat in his zone. During a power play, the shorthanded team {{will try to}} ice the puck {{in order to gain}} time until the penalty time ends.|$|R

5000|$|Development of Backyard Monsters {{started in}} 2009, {{but the game}} was not {{released}} until January 2010 as [...] "Desktop Creatures" [...] before being renamed by fan vote to [...] "Backyard Monsters" [...] seeing as the game {{had nothing to do}} with desktops in its original release on Facebook. Backyard Monsters is a real-time strategy game on Facebook with, unlike other Facebook games, [...] "destruction and gore and mayhem." [...] Players begin by building a yard for their monsters, designed so that essential buildings are protected by defensive towers. If the player's yard is designed correctly, <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> stop invading monsters who try to damage the buildings and loot resources.|$|R
5000|$|Quick passing is an {{important}} element of attacking any zone. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> shift as the ball moves, but if the offense can move the ball faster than the defense can react, open shots can result. Quick passing against a zone often leads to open three-point shots, and zone defenses are less effective against teams with good three-point shooters.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a stunt is to confuse {{opposing}} blockers, which is an aid to the defense in rushing an opposing forward pass or kick. The main weakness of a stunt {{is that it is}} more vulnerable than average to running plays by the opposing team. In most cases, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> not use a play incorporating stunting if it expects a running play from the offense.|$|E
50|$|If {{the barbarians}} are {{successful}} in their attack (if they have a strength greater than Catan), then the players must pay the consequence. The player(s) who had <b>the</b> least <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> be attacked, and will have one city reduced to a settlement. If they only have settlements, or metropolises, then they are immune to barbarians and do not count as the player contributing <b>the</b> least <b>defense.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{implement}} these changes, <b>the</b> Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>will</b> {{be creating}} a transition team to review options and recommend steps for implementation. The implementation process {{is expected to}} take at least two years.|$|R

5000|$|Defenses {{generally}} do not rely on the wheel play in bunt situations where the bunter is deemed a good enough hitter {{to be able to}} execute the [...] "butcher boy" [...] swing. Instead, the third baseman and shortstop will hold their positions, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> rely on the pitcher to field the ball, and concede an advance to third if the bunt is well executed.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> {{succeed in}} {{blocking}} a field goal. If a blocked field goal is in or behind the neutral zone, it is {{treated like a}} fumble and can be advanced by either team. Beyond the neutral zone, a blocked kick is treated like a punt and can be advanced only by the defense, unless a defensive player fumbles the ball, after which an offensive player can advance it.|$|E
50|$|The defense {{should try}} to make declarer ruff in the long trump hand. Unless declarer is playing for a dummy reversal, he usually intends to ruff losers in the short trump hand anyway. If the defense can shorten declarer's trumps sufficiently, it may wind up with more trumps than declarer. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> {{be able to pull}} any {{remaining}} trumps and run its own winners.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{soldiers}} of the Air Force Air Defense Wing have started the respective training course. One Air <b>Defense</b> Battery <b>will</b> be supplied with the armament; and the personnel training of <b>the</b> Air <b>Defense</b> Wing <b>will</b> {{be completed by the}} end of 2007.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the dozens}} of suits filed against them by investors {{involving}} claims of inaccurate ratings the rating agencies have defended themselves using a First Amendment defense (based on the precedent of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan). This maintains a credit rating is an opinion protected as free speech and requires plaintiffs to prove actual malice by the agency [...] However, some wonder if <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> ultimately prevail.|$|E
5000|$|In passing situations, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> assign {{players to}} guard {{portions}} of the field, forming a defensive [...] "shell" [...] that the defense hopes will either prevent the offense from completing a pass or ensure a defensive player is able to tackle the receiver after a completed pass. The general terminology used to describe this alignment is [...] "Cover #," [...] with [...] "#" [...] being the number of defensive players forming the coverage shell.|$|E
50|$|On January 18 it was {{announced}} that with the hiring of defensive coordinator Dom Capers that the Packers would switch their base defensive scheme from a 4-3 to a 3-4 scheme which implements three down linemen and four linebackers instead of four down linemen and three linebackers in the traditional 4-3. While <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> now be based out of the 3-4, head coach Mike McCarthy stated that they will also use some four man fronts thus being more of a hybrid 3-4/4-3 defense.|$|E
50|$|Another {{step that}} must occur {{early in the}} {{investigation}} is contact prosecutor assigned to the case. The prosecutor {{will be asked to}} provide information about the conduct that resulted in the defendant's conviction, victim's losses, the defendant's history, and any other data relevant to the sentencing decision. During <b>the</b> investigation, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> counsel <b>will</b> also be asked to discuss the same topics.|$|R
