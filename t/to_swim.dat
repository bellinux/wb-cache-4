5|$|Species that do need <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} {{go through a}} process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability <b>to</b> <b>swim.</b> It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E

5|$|The {{final chapter}} {{begins with the}} men's {{resolution}} to abandon the floundering dinghy they have occupied for thirty hours and <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> on. After three of the men safely reach the shore and are met {{by a group of}} rescuers, they find Billie dead, his body washed up on the beach.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E

5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting.

5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke.

5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable <b>to</b> <b>swim.</b> They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

5|$|As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by {{an allergy}} to chlorine. As a result, {{he did not}} swim in his first race until a school {{carnival}} {{at the age of}} seven. The allergy forced Thorpe <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches <b>to</b> <b>swim</b> alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.|$|E
