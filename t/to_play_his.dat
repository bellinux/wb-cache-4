5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>his</b> music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no}} need to write for existing ensembles.

When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Spider-Man 3, Sony Pictures Entertainment had {{announced}} a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who wrote {{the second and third}} films, was working on yet another attempt. Raimi wanted John Malkovich <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>his</b> next villain. However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.|$|E

Afterwards, the band {{returned to the}} studio to record the album Destroy Erase Improve at Soundfront Studios in Uppsala, with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer. Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months. During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance.

Machine Head's bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a pitch shifter <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>his</b> guitar at an octave lower than usual.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan {{suggested that they}} should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>his</b> part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, {{in the last years of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Zappa met Ray Collins. Collins {{supported}} himself by {{working as a}} carpenter, and on weekends sang with {{a group called the}} Soul Giants.

The Soul Giants' repertoire originally consisted of R covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>his</b> own original material and try to get a record contract. While most of the band members liked the idea, then-leader and saxophone player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band.
