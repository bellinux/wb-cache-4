It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E

On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are going through this. Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma." [...] Scott called his character [...] "bumbling at times," [...] adding, [...] "He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan." ...|$|E
500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E

5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Falchuk {{stated that}} season four will not revolve around relationships {{as much as}} past seasons, commenting, [...] "Relationships in general will be less of a focus this year, I personally <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> these characters are more interesting not in relationships. And I <b>think</b> with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> them we will be exploring that. Whether they break up or not, we’re really focused on giving them more individual stories." ...|$|R
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tutu {{came out}} in support of {{assisted}} dying on July 2014, stating that life shouldn't be preserved [...] "at any cost". He also said that laws that deny the right to assisted dying deprive those who are dying of their [...] "human right to dignity". He gave the example of Nelson Mandela, whose long and painful illness was in his opinion [...] "an affront to Madiba's dignity". Tutu stated that {{in a similar situation}} he would not want to have his own life [...] "prolonged artificially", saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Revolver, Cedric discussed the theme of [...] "Teflon": [...] "I had been writing the lyrics and sort of testing the waters of how much I could say if McCain had won the election. I don't usually write anything about things like that. I think 'Teflon' is my favorite because it kind of has that slacker attitude of someone who doesn't vote {{but at the same}} time is giving a fuck. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> could maybe understand that."

2500|$|One of Erica's {{defining}} features is her extreme self-centered {{point of}} view. Erica {{is described as}} [...] "imaginative, adventurous, and brilliant", yet writers detailed her as appearing [...] "scarcely rational enough to cope with adulthood." [...] Despite this, the character represents independence and power. [...] "I think of Erica as a go-getter," [...] Lucci said, [...] "someone who's impatient to have a terrific life and have it yesterday. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> can identify with that." [...] She always controls her business whether involved with a man or not. Some of the jobs she has been given during her storylines include a high fashion model, a cosmetics tycoon, and a magazine publisher.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> go through that.|$|E
2500|$|Dog Man Star was {{released}} in the UK 10 October 1994, and entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 3.

[...] Lead single [...] "We Are the Pigs", peaked at 18, plunging to 38 the following week. The choice of lead single had been a subject of debate, with Sony wanting to release [...] "New Generation" [...] first for commercial reasons.

The third single [...] "New Generation" [...] charted at no. 21. [...] "The Power", the proposed fourth single, set for release May of 1995 never materialised.|$|E
