25|$|Selective inhibitors {{were used}} to {{determine}} the involved CYPs in the aconitine metabolism. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that aconitine was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, 3A5 and 2D6. CYP2C8 and 2C9 had a minor role to the aconitine metabolism, whereas CYP1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 did not produce any aconitine metabolites at all. The proposed metabolic pathways of aconitine in human liver microsomes and the CYPs involved to it are summarized in the table above.|$|E
25|$|Small genetic {{differences}} were reportedly found among Southeastern European (Greece, Albania) populations and {{especially those of}} the Dniester–Carpathian (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region. Despite this low level of differentiation between them, tree reconstruction and principal component analyses allowed a distinction between Balkan–Carpathian (Romanians, Moldovans, Ukrainians, Macedonians and Gagauzes) and Balkan Mediterranean (Greeks, Albanians, Turks) population groups. The genetic affinities among Dniester–Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships. According to the report, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that the ethnic and genetic differentiations occurred in these regions to a considerable extent independently of each other.|$|E

The geomicrobiological aspects of this expedition had three objectives: [...] "to test laser induced fluorescence emission (L.I.F.E.) {{to be used for}} the exploration of the Mars regolith and poles; monitor global climate change; and to evaluate methods for detecting hydrocarbon contamination and subsequent bio-remediation in a fragile, endangered ecosystem."
