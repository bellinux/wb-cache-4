25|$|Kierkegaard's {{analysis}} of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and Marx's theory of alienation. However Kierkegaard expressly means {{that human beings are}} alienated from God because they are living <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Individuals need to gain their souls from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as Karl Marx does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.|$|E
25|$|The German Idealist philosopher Fichte had {{attempted}} {{to show that the}} whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of self-consciousness. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing it <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner of subjective idealism. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the aesthetic view of nature to which Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment had pointed.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West considered Pam's {{speech to}} be [...] "a terrific payoff {{for those of}} us invested (some might say <b>too</b> <b>much)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jim-Pam-Karen love triangle." [...] West also praised other aspects of the episode, such as the fire walk and the sequences with Stanley' to her, [...] "everyone brought his or her A game (in hilarity, if not in effort) to the race to succeed Michael." [...] IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Beach Games" [...] 8.5/10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. Like West, he highlighted Stanley for praise, and also liked Helms being trapped on the lake. Fickett concluded that [...] "while this episode's closing scene doesn't have the impact of Jim telling Pam {{he was in love with}} her at the end of Season 2, it is one of those long awaited moments that we knew was coming. And Jenna Fischer, as Pam, handles it perfectly. Once again the Scranton branch is facing some big changes, and the show has us eagerly awaiting the season finale." ...|$|E

500|$|Krusty starts {{performing}} his clown tricks at {{a theater}} {{in front of}} adults, and not children like before. This is because Annie knows {{that there is nothing}} adults enjoy more than the things they liked as children. The performances are praised by both the audience and the critics, and Krusty and Annie initiate a relationship again. Soon, a premium cable television network called HBOWTIME (an obvious portmanteau of HBO and Showtime, straight down to their parody of HBO's longtime slogan, [...] "It's not just TV, it's more expensive.") gives Krusty his own show and Annie is hired as the producer on his demand. The stars of the series Entourage, such as Kevin Dillon, become Krusty's assistants. The network executives soon become frustrated with Annie for meddling <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show. For example, she refuses to let Janeane Garofalo appear only because Garofalo is funnier than Krusty. She also runs over an intern with a stage car for sharpening her pencil too much. The executives decide to fire Annie, but Krusty refuses to continue without her. The couple therefore turns to another network where they start a show called Sex Over Sixty, with them as the stars.|$|E
500|$|The Comcast Center is {{the tallest}} {{building}} built in America outside of New York City or Chicago since 1993. The [...] Comcast Center has 58 floors, of which 56 are occupiable. The {{structure of the}} Comcast Center comprises a central concrete core with steel-framed floors. The building's exterior features a glass curtain wall made of lightly tinted, non-reflective low-emissivity glass. The tower tapers inward towards the top and features two cutouts {{near the top of}} the building on the north and south sides. To prevent the tower from swaying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, the Comcast Center contains a [...] double-chambered concrete tuned liquid column damper, the largest such damper in North America. Receiving a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating in April 2009, the Comcast Center is the tallest LEED building in Philadelphia. The building was designed to use 40 percent less water than a typical office building, and the plaza was designed to reduce heat-island effect from the pavement by 70 percent. Reducing air conditioning and lighting costs, the low-emissivity glass curtain wall blocks 60 percent of heat while allowing 70 percent of the Sun's light inside.|$|E
500|$|As the googly {{caused a}} {{sensation}} following its invention, many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet. Reggie Schwarz, the South African cricketer {{who played for}} Middlesex, learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet; Schwarz in turn {{passed it on to}} the South African bowlers Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White. These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting. Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans, it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established. In later years, the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting. Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in The Morning Post during 1924, later reprinted in Wisden, which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly. He wrote: [...] "It is not for me to defend it. Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited it, and, if blame is to be allotted, let it be on their shoulders. For me is the task of the historian, and if I appear <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of the proud parent, I ask forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|Accelerated Evolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called Accelerated Evolution [...] "the {{album of the}} year", praising it for [...] "the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy 'n' rockin' yet majestic and beautiful." [...] William Hughes of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "amazing", saying the album [...] "has elements that will appeal to fans of all different genres, from progressive to metal." [...] Alex Henderson of Allmusic called the album [...] "excellent", and praised Townsend's ability to blend genres and influences: [...] "The Canadian rocker provides enough downtuned guitars to put this CD in the alt rock category. And yet Accelerated Evolution has a big sound that suggests the pop-metal, arena rock and hard rock of the '70s and '80s â€“ big melodies, big harmonies, big guitars, big vocals, big production." [...] Chris Hawkins of KNAC.com said, [...] "Like always, what Devin manages {{to do is take}} the most infectious rhythm, place his stamp upon it, and thus create something completely original." [...] Xander Hoose of Chronicles of Chaos compared the album favorably to SYL, noting that [...] "there is more variation, and the songs are more memorable and layered than their one-dimensional SYL counterparts." [...] Hoose added, [...] "For those who thought Terria was going <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong direction, Accelerated Evolution will probably come as a relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott D.

[...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tight end Bob Moore was traded, {{along with}} a 1979 first-round draft pick, for three-time All-Pro Bears {{defensive}} end Wally Chambers.

Council Rudolph, the only player who had started in all 28 of the Buccaneersâ€™ games to date, was made expendable by the trade and was dealt to the Miami Dolphins for a draft pick.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1984, {{significant}} differences in the value of negotiated contracts, and divergent union objectives had {{set the stage for the}} creation of the CAW, a process documented in the Genie Award winning film, Final Offer. In 1984, the Canadian section of the UAW, under the leadership of Bob White and his assistants Buzz Hargrove and Bob Nickerson, broke from the UAW, led by Owen Bieber, because the American union was seen as giving away <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of concessions during collective bargaining. Additionally, the UAW had been lobbying the U.S. Congress to force the transfer of auto production from Canada to the U.S. and the Canadian branch felt there was a lack of a representative voice during UAW's conventions.

Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability I doubt it very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's {{not a lot of}} depth.

2500|$|Genco Russo {{never was}} the [...] "boss of all bosses" [...] {{as the media}} {{depicted}} him. He certainly had leverage providing voters for the DC at a local level, but it is hardly imaginable that the Mafia was ruled from a small and isolated town {{in the interior of}} Sicily, and not by the powerful Mafia families in Palermo. The fact that Salvatore Greco [...] "Ciaschiteddu" [...] â€“ a representative of the Palermo based Mafia â€“ was made 'secretary' of the first Sicilian Mafia Commission and not Genco Russo was a clear sign that his influence was limited. Genco Russo probably only was present at the Grand Hotel des Palmes Mafia meeting in 1957 because one of his relatives from the US, Santo Sorge, was there as well. Genco Russo apparently irritated other Mafia bosses because he was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media spotlight. [...] "Did you see Gina Lollobrigida in the newspaper today," [...] a mafioso once said, referring to the notoriously ugly appearance of Genco Russo. The new generation of mafiosi did not share the style of openly exercised power. Instead they preferred to operate clandestinely and detested publicity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Barth edited the {{periodical}} VÃ¥r HÃ¦r from 1946 to 1964, and Norges Forsvar from 1964 to 1966. VÃ¥r HÃ¦r {{was published by}} the Norwegian Army Regular Officers' Association and spoke {{on behalf of the}} association's members, while Norges Forsvar was and still is the magazine of the Norges Forsvarsforening (Norwegian Defence Association). In a 1946 leader, VÃ¥r HÃ¦r criticized the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Jens Christian Hauge and demanded his resignation. The resignation demand, which included claims that Hauge had ignored the advice of military professionals and involved himself <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> details of military matters in the post-war reconstruction of the Norwegian Armed Forces, led to a debate in the national newspapers. Barth stated in the debate that [...] "most army officers" [...] would agree with the criticism of Hauge. In the debate Barth was himself criticised by the Norwegian Army Officers' Association which said it was too soon to judge minister Hauge's efforts, and that Barth's statements were too broad in nature. In the following years criticism of defence minister Hauge leadership increased among officers, media and politicians, and ended with Hauge announcing his resignation in late 1951. Barth wrote an editorial in VÃ¥r HÃ¦r after Hauge's resignation where he stated that in his view the defence minister had had [...] "increasingly dictatorial tendencies over the years" [...] and [...] "lacked an ability to cooperate".|$|E
