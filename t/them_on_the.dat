Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement <b>them,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds they were impractical and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.|$|E

5|$|Following a short refit, Sydney sailed for Fremantle on 27 February, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to escort and patrol tasks in the Indian Ocean. This primarily involved meeting convoys off the southern Australian coast and escorting <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next leg of their journey, either westbound to the Middle East and Europe, or northwards to the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

5|$|The {{fiscal year}} 2007 gave a revenue of NOK61 million, and {{a deficit of}} NOK13 million. During the airport strike in May 2008—which closed Bergen Airport—Vildanden had full planes since they could land <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> short runway at near-by Stord Airport, Sørstokken.

5|$|A bronze {{column in}} the shape of {{intertwined}} snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|After Anne's accession, {{the problem}} of the {{succession}} re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security 1704, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Acts of Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.|$|E

5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|After the Persians' departure, the Greeks {{collected}} {{their dead}} and buried <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill. After the Persian invasion was repulsed, a stone lion was erected at Thermopylae to commemorate Leonidas. A full 40 years after the battle, Leonidas' bones were returned to Sparta, where he was buried again with full honors; funeral games were held every year in his memory.|$|E

5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, {{primarily because of the}} onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> title pages of her books.|$|E
5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> secondary market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
5000|$|Meyer's overall {{coaching}} {{style and}} philosophy is best {{summed up in}} a quote still given to TCU athletes before they go out to compete - [...] "Fight 'em until hell freezes over. Then fight <b>'em</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice!" ...|$|R
