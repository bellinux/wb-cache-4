5|$|Initially {{appointed}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 5th U.S. Infantry, {{within a few weeks}} Raynolds was transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers. The <b>Topographical</b> Engineers performed surveys and developed maps for army use until their merger with the Corps of Engineers in 1863. Raynolds's first assignments from 1843 to 1844 were as an assistant <b>topographical</b> engineer involved in improving navigation on the Ohio River and surveying the northeastern boundary of the U.S. between 1844 and 1847.|$|E

5|$|As Secretary of War, Eaton {{supported}} compensation upon discharge {{for soldiers}} who had served honorably. He made the <b>Topographical</b> Engineers a separate bureau within the War Department.|$|E
5|$|At the {{culmination}} of the policy, no geographical or <b>topographical</b> names of non-Turkish origin remained. Some of the newer names resembled their native names, but with revised Turkish connotations (i.e. Aghtamar was changed to Akdamar).|$|E
5|$|Lorenzo Sitgreaves led {{the first}} Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers mission across {{northern}} Arizona to the Colorado River (near modern Bullhead City, Arizona), and down its east bank {{to the river}} crossings of the Southern Immigrant Trail at Fort Yuma in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the <b>topographical</b> features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 <b>topographical</b> trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E
5|$|Southcote was {{mentioned}} in Samuel Lewis's 1835 <b>Topographical</b> Dictionary of England. It {{was described as}} a tything within the parish of St Mary's, Reading, and had a population of 84.|$|E

5|$|The map the Workmans {{made during}} this trip was of low quality. According to Mason, the couple {{did not have}} a good sense of <b>topographical</b> direction, which meant that their {{measurements}} were inaccurate and unusable by the Survey of India.|$|E
5|$|The second Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers {{expedition}} {{passed along}} {{and crossed the}} Colorado was the 1853-1854 Pacific Railroad Survey expedition along the 35th parallel north from Oklahoma to Los Angeles, led by Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological evidence, {{such as the}} Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also {{supports}} some of Herodotus' specific claims. George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough <b>topographical</b> survey of the narrow pass at Thermopylae, {{and to the extent}} that modern accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's. For example, the military strategist Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart defers to Grundy.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five {{scientists}} to spend eleven {{days on the}} island. The main focuses were aerial photography and <b>topographical</b> measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced. The second important area was marine biological investigations, although also geological, biological and other surveys were conducted. The team also built an automatic weather station. Three DX-peditions {{have been sent to}} the island, in 1987, 1994 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Mary Russell Mitford {{lived in}} Reading {{for a number}} of years and then spent the rest of her life just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. The fictional Belford Regis of her eponymous novel, first {{published}} in 1835, is largely based on Reading. Described with <b>topographical</b> accuracy, it is still possible to follow the steps of the novel's characters in present-day Reading.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} <b>topographical</b> {{features}} are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Thracian Plain, and the Rhodope Mountains. The {{southern edge of}} the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the Danube defines the border with Romania. The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of <b>topographical</b> maps causing a real problem in {{the first months of}} the war. Commanders had {{difficulty}} planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E
5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, <b>topographical</b> imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 the United States Board of Engineers {{conducted}} a preliminary {{survey of the}} coast of Florida. In a report written by Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, the Board recommended that Key Biscayne be made a military reservation, and the United States Secretary of War so ordered in March 1849. Later that year, the United States Army Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers set up a camp with an astronomical/magnetic station {{to serve as a}} datum base for a survey of the Florida Keys and the Great Florida Reef.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, <b>topographical</b> officer George W. Hughes {{reported}} to Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights in the zone, allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|Mount Downton {{was named}} by D. M. MacKay, {{a member of}} the British Columbia Land Surveyors (BCLS) who {{conducted}} <b>topographical</b> surveys in the area. He named it after Geoffrey M. Downton, another BCLS member who is credited for first noting the hydroelectric potential inherent in the elevation differential between the Bridge River and Seton Lake on opposing sides of Mission Ridge above Shalalth in December 1912. This name for the mountain was adopted on February 7, 1947. The name Itcha Mountain was adopted on March 4, 1954 for the range's second highest peak.|$|E
5|$|One of Pliny's {{authorities}} is Marcus Terentius Varro. In {{the geographical}} books, Varro is supplemented by the <b>topographical</b> commentaries of Agrippa, which were {{completed by the}} emperor Augustus; for his zoology, he relies largely on Aristotle and on Juba, the scholarly Mauretanian king, studiorum claritate memorabilior quam regno (v. 16). Juba {{is one of his}} principal guides in botany; Theophrastus is also named in his Indices, and Pliny had translated Theophrastus's Greek into Latin. Another work by Theophrastus, On Stones was cited as a source on ores and minerals. Pliny strove to use all the Greek histories available to him, such as Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as the Bibliotheca Historica of Diodorus Siculus.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed of the Snake River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where {{the headwaters of the}} Snake River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out many <b>topographical</b> features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
5|$|Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys {{with the}} Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers of {{possible}} transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt {{that such a}} project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including {{the expansion of the}} United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and <b>topographical</b> conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|The four-lane {{divided highway}} passes through three major urban centres of Saskatchewan, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current. A {{site in the}} Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, an internationally {{acclaimed}} shorebird conservation strategy, is at the village of Chaplin approximately equal distance between Swift Current and Moose Jaw. Located southwest of the Trans–Canada is the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park, which features Fort Walsh and the highest elevation of Saskatchewan. Highway 1 traverses ranch lands, the Missouri Coteau <b>topographical</b> area, and rolling prairie agricultural plains.|$|E
5|$|The lakes were {{deliberately}} {{designed so}} that their orientation was related to various <b>topographical</b> landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched {{from east to west}} and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was {{designed so that}} looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E
5|$|The site of Canberra was {{selected}} for {{the location of the}} nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or Brasília in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin {{was selected}} and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant <b>topographical</b> landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{continued}} {{in this role}} during the Engineering Brigade's deployment with the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, several times performing ably under hostile fire. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for his service at the Siege of Yorktown, as of May 4, 1862. Following the abandonment of the campaign {{and the return of}} the Army of the Potomac to northern Virginia, General Barnard, now chief engineer of defenses of Washington, D.C., requested Alexander serve as his aide-de-camp. Alexander accepted and served in that capacity throughout 1862. When the <b>Topographical</b> Engineers and the Army Corps of Engineers were merged on March 3, 1863, Alexander (whose permanent U.S. Army rank was captain until this time) was promoted to major, while retaining his brevet (honorary) rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|Barton Stone Alexander (September 4, 1819– December 15, 1878) was an American {{engineer}} commander {{during the}} American Civil War who {{rose to the}} brevet rank of brigadier general in the regular army. He {{was a graduate of}} the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served in the United States Army's Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers, which at times was both a part of and separate from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. After graduating from West Point as a second lieutenant in the Class of 1842, he served in the Mexican-American War, building fortifications to protect American supply lines in the advance on Mexico City. After the end of the war, he was stationed in Washington, D.C., where he served as architect for the Scott Building and Quarters Buildings at the U.S. Soldiers' Home and took over the completion of the Smithsonian Institution Building after dissatisfaction with the pace of the first architect caused him to be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial <b>topographical</b> features direct the movement of wind and fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind and fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the <b>topographical</b> basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1883, Gaudí {{designed}} the Santísimo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San Félix de Alella, {{as well as}} some <b>topographical</b> plans for the Can Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the Cantabrian town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by Máximo Díaz de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Cristòfor Cascante i Colom, Gaudí's fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower {{in the shape of a}} Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large sash window, and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.|$|E
5|$|Khaplu Palace is {{the second}} fort in Baltistan to be renovated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Renovation started in 2005 and was {{completed}} in 2011. The project {{was funded by the}} Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs via its embassy in Islamabad. USAID helped fund an exhibition centre for Balti culture inside the fort. The exhibition centre takes up two-thirds of the site. The renovation work was carried out with the help of people from 400 local families employed as an initiative towards community building. The survey encompassing the <b>topographical</b> features of the renovation site. begun in 2005, used Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) devices. The survey helped in finding the original state of a number of decrepit portions of the palace. The renovation project was carried out following the Venice Charter's standards for restoration. The material procured for the restoration amounted to thirty million rupees (Rs 30 m), while the wages of the labourers aggregated to about twenty five million rupees (Rs 25 m).|$|E
5|$|Pope was a {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy in 1842. He served in the Mexican-American War and had numerous assignments as a <b>topographical</b> engineer and surveyor in Florida, New Mexico, and Minnesota. He spent much of the last decade before the Civil War surveying possible southern routes for the proposed First Transcontinental Railroad. He was an early appointee as a Union brigadier general of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen. Sterling Price in Missouri, then led a successful campaign that captured Island No. 10 on the Mississippi River. This inspired the Lincoln administration to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed Army of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Pope {{was born}} in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a {{prominent}} Federal judge in early Illinois Territory {{and a friend of}} lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Raynolds {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from illness after the Valley Campaign, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and VIII Corps in January 1863. Promoted {{to major in}} the Corps of Engineers, {{he found himself in}} charge of the defenses of vital Harpers Ferry, West Virginia in March 1863 during Robert E. Lee's second Confederate invasion of the north during the Gettysburg Campaign. On March 31, 1863, the Corps of <b>Topographical</b> Engineers ceased to be an independent branch of the army and was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career. Officers from the two corps maintained their ranks based on the time at which they received their promotion.|$|E
