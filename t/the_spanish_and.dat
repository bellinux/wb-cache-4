5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic of the natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|E
5|$|From 28 February onwards the Spanish {{expedition}} {{was repeatedly}} approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows {{in the direction}} of the intruders but inflicted no casualties. At the same time, small groups of curious Itzas mingled freely with <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> received trinkets from them such as belts, necklaces and earrings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ancient}} world, in {{addition}} to Salamis, major naval engagements included the Battle of Actium, which permitted the establishment of Augustus's empire. In the modern era, important naval battles include the English victories against the Armada in 1588 and at Trafalgar in 1805, which broke the threats of invasion by the superior land forces of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> French empires.|$|E

During his second term as governor, Rogers died in Nassau {{at the age of}} about 53.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{ambulance}} begins in ancient times, {{with the use of}} carts to transport incurable patients by force. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish,</b> <b>and</b> civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.|$|E

After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of Tikal. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as a refuge from <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.|$|E

5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food, wood for construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the Spanish. In addition, pigs had been introduced by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{is thought}} to be already {{inhabited}} by Filipinos since the pre-colonial period, based on analysis of discovered human remains, coffins, an ancient burial cloth and other archaeological finds by the National Museum in the 1930s. The present settlement was founded in 1622 by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> is the oldest settlement in the province. During the American colonial period, the municipality changed its name to Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. Today, Banton is one of Romblon's thriving municipalities, with an economy dependent on copra farming, fishing, raffia palm weaving, and tourism.|$|E

5|$|By summer 1537, Montejo {{believed}} that Higueras {{had been almost}} completely pacified, with very few casualties amongst either the Spanish or the natives. Gracias a Dios and San Pedro were more secure, and many Indians had returned to their villages, encouraged by Montejo's moderate policies. In reality, only the areas around the Spanish settlements had been thoroughly conquered, and in the remoter areas {{the vast majority of}} the natives were still hostile to <b>the</b> <b>Spanish,</b> <b>and</b> determined to resist. In contrast to other provinces, the Spanish were unable to recruit reliable native auxiliaries to assist their conquest.|$|E
5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E

5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E
