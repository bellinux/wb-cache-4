5|$|Agnes Fay Morgan (May 4, 1884 – July 20, 1968) was an American chemist and academic. She was the {{longtime}} {{chair of the}} home economics program at the University of California. Her program was strongly grounded in science, and students admitted into <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> required to have a level of science education that was not typical of home economics programs at the time. Morgan {{was one of the}} earliest married female college professors in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the largely}} {{forgotten}} show {{was located in}} the 1980s by film historian Jim Schoenberger, with the ending (including credits) found afterward. Both copies are black and white kinescopes, but the original live broadcast was in color. The rights to <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> acquired by MGM {{at the same time}} as the rights for the 1967 film version of Casino Royale, clearing the legal pathway and enabling it to make the 2006 film of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the initiation of}} the 18th Engineers Brigade's Operation Last Chance, a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year's engineer operations. The goals of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> to maintain primary missions of the combat support as well as insure {{the completion of the}} many projects planned for the 1970 construction operations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>program</b> ITA 2.0 {{implements}} both {{classical and}} inductive ITA. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> available on http://www.jstatsoft.org/v16/i10. A short documentation of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> available in http://www.jstatsoft.org/v16/i10/paper.|$|R

5000|$|English-language {{editions of}} <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>are</b> often {{referred}} to as [...] "BB". Many Spanish-language editions of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>are</b> called Gran Hermano (GH).|$|R
5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{character}} and <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Phase 6 - process evaluation=== This {{phase is}} used to {{evaluate}} the process by which <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> being implemented. This phase determines whether <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> being implemented according to the protocol, and determines whether the objectives of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>are</b> being met. It also helps identify modifications that may be needed to improve <b>the</b> <b>program.</b>|$|R
50|$|On Monday, March 10, 2008, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> back to <b>the</b> afternoon, {{starting}} at 2:00 pm. However, seven days later, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> canceled.|$|R
50|$|From October 1960 to November 1962, {{at least}} 11 launch {{attempts}} were made. Portions of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>are</b> still considered classified information. It <b>is</b> believed that <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> cancelled because <b>the</b> imagery produced <b>was</b> poor. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> operated by <b>the</b> United States Air Force, but was overshadowed by <b>the</b> CIA's CORONA <b>program.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mark Gyrion, Daley's second cousin, was a {{superintendent}} of garages for the City's Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap. Gyrion's mother-in-law's firm, Jacz Transportation, {{participated in the}} Hired Truck Program, receiving about $1 million between 1998 and 2004. Jacz Transportation bought a truck {{three days after the}} city sold it to a Franklin Park dealership and then leased it back to the city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law's role in the Hired Truck Program and the transfer of the truck. Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from the Hired Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.|$|E
5|$|She has, however, {{sometimes}} {{participated in}} retrospective documentaries, including {{an interview for}} the 2006 DVD release of Baby Doll, which includes a documentary featuring Baker reflecting on the film's impact on her career. Baker has also been featured in documentaries about several of her co-stars, including Clark Gable, Roger Moore, Sal Mineo, and James Dean, including the 1975 James Dean: The First American Teenager, and a 1985 BBC Radio 2 tribute marking the 30th anniversary of the actor's death. Her memories of James Dean at the Actors Studio and later in Giant were recalled on BBC Radio 2 in 1982, when she guested on You're Tearing Me Apart, Terence Pettigrew's documentary which commemorated the 25th anniversary of Dean's death {{in a car accident}} in 1955. Also on <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> singer-actor Adam Faith and the screenwriter Ray Connolly.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} unmanned reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> later used on unmanned missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred to NASA. The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other Titan rockets — the stretched first and second stages became the Titan 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later Titan IIIB flights, and on the Titan 34D. The seven-segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on the Titan IVA.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{organization}} divides <b>programs</b> by participant age. <b>The</b> Beaver <b>program</b> <b>is</b> {{for participants}} {{from five to}} seven. <b>The</b> Wolf Cub <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from eight to ten. <b>The</b> SCOUTSabout <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from five to ten. <b>The</b> Scout <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from 11 to 16. <b>The</b> Venturer <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from 15 to 17. <b>The</b> Extreme Adventure <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from 14 to 17. <b>The</b> Rovers <b>program</b> <b>is</b> for participants from 18 to 26.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> {{created by}} Bernard St-Laurent, who hosted it until his {{retirement}} from the CBC in June 2015. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> initially expected to continue with a new host in the fall; although the CBC has not issued a formal cancellation announcement, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> not currently airing on the Radio One schedule.|$|R
50|$|Auburn has had 20 head men's {{basketball}} coaches since <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> {{started in}} 1906 by Mike Donahue. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> currently coached by Bruce Pearl.|$|R
5|$|The {{projects}} ran out {{of funding}} due to the 1975–1976 New York City fiscal crisis, along {{with the fact that}} the MTA did not have a consistent funding source (its five-year Capital Programs were implemented in 1982 due to further decline in the subway after 1975–1976). Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, lines for the Program for Action had to be reduced or canceled altogether due to the crisis. Because of the fiscal crisis, the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street lines, the only two complete lines to be built under <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> <b>were</b> truncated and delayed, and there were plans to abandon the expansions altogether.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
25|$|PRISM {{was first}} {{publicly}} revealed on 6 June 2013, after classified documents about <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> leaked to The Washington Post and The Guardian by Edward Snowden.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2010. At {{the time of}} <b>the</b> announcement, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors, with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow. The object of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> to save <b>the</b> lives of 16 million people {{during the period of}} <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> <b>The</b> implementation of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> will <b>be</b> led by the World Health Organisation, reporting to the UN.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} scaled {{down and}} {{it remains to be}} classified until the existence of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> made public by dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's memoir published on 28 May 2011. Development on Ghauri <b>program</b> <b>was</b> completed around 50% but the funding for <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> halted in 2004. Although Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan held President Pervez Musharraf responsible for capping <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, <b>the</b> Shaheen <b>program</b> continued to progress well.|$|R

25|$|KLM started KLM AirCares, {{a program}} that aids {{underprivileged}} children in developing countries to which KLM flies, in 1999. The airline collects money and airmiles from passengers. In 2012, new applications for support from <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>were</b> suspended because it needed an overhaul.|$|E
25|$|All the {{remaining}} roles were cast around Colman and Tennant. All these roles were cast via auditions, which took several weeks.
