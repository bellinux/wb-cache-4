500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> (<b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>do)</b> / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe's Tom Russo had varied {{reactions}} to the film. Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with Halloween II, but only achieved mixed results for his efforts. Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as [...] "pretentiously silly", but agreed that the scenes did help {{to break up the}} standard genre violence and {{even went so far as}} to compare the sensation created by those scenes to [...] "Tim Burton doing straight horror". In the end, Russo claimed that [...] "only the most hardcore fans" [...] would want the film series to continue. Joe Neumaier, of the Daily News, stated that Zombie has found himself with Halloween II. Neumaier describes the film as a successful [...] "'character-based' monster-flick". Zombie's use of music from the 1970s, like The Moody Blues' [...] "Nights in White Satin" [...] and 10cc's [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love", is [...] "terrifically odd" [...] throughout the film. Neumaier also said that the imagery of Deborah Myers and the [...] "ethereal white horse" [...] were a [...] "nice visual relief" [...] from Michael's violent attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the next 23 years, 10cc scored three UK No.1 singles and five Top 10 albums, with Gouldman co-writing some of their biggest hits, {{including}} [...] "The Wall Street Shuffle" [...] (1974), [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] (1975), [...] "I'm Mandy, Fly Me" [...] (1976), [...] "Art For Art's Sake" [...] (1976), [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love" [...] (1977) and [...] "Dreadlock Holiday" [...] (1978).|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Stewart and Gouldman {{released}} 10cc's Deceptive Bends album, with singles [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love" [...] peaking at No. 2 in the UK and No. 5 in the US {{followed by}} [...] "Good Morning Judge" [...] going top 5 in the UK The 1978 Bloody Tourists album featured their best selling and final No. 1 single, [...] "Dreadlock Holiday", later {{used in the}} 2010 Mark Zuckerberg biopic The Social Network, but [...] "he 10cc hit machine effectively {{ground to a halt}} when Eric Stewart was involved in a car crash in January 1979".|$|E
2500|$|He {{alleges that}} the {{problems}} are traceable {{to a set of}} related assumptions about the nature of language, which themselves presuppose a particular conception of the essence of language. This conception is considered and ultimately rejected for being too general; that is, as an essentialist account of the nature of language it is simply too narrow to be able to account for the variety of <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with language. Wittgenstein begins the book with a quotation from St. Augustine, whom he cites as a proponent of the generalized and limited conception that he then summarizes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, Sedaka {{embarked}} on a successful English tour and was introduced by Harvey Lisberg to the four future members of 10cc (best known to American audiophiles for [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] and [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love") with whom he recorded the Solitaire album at their Strawberry Studios in Stockport. As well as the title track, [...] "Solitaire", which was successfully covered by Andy Williams (UK Top 5 singles chart) and the Carpenters (US Top 20), it included two UK Top 40 singles, one of which ("Beautiful You") also charted briefly in America, Sedaka's first US chart appearance in ten years. However, the album's minor performance generated little interest in restarting Sedaka's career.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse said on her death-bed, [...] "I only love simplicity. I have {{a horror}} of pretence", and she {{spoke out against}} some of the claims made {{concerning}} the Lives of saints written in her day, [...] "We should not say improbable things, or <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know. We must see their real, and not their imagined lives." [...] The depth of her spirituality, of which she said, [...] "my way is all confidence and love", has inspired many believers. In the face of her littleness she trusted in God to be her sanctity. She wanted to go to heaven by an entirely new little way. [...] "I wanted to find an elevator that would raise me to Jesus". The elevator, she wrote, would be the arms of Jesus lifting her in all her littleness.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{departure}} of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer Paul Burgess, who had {{up to that point}} been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three piece band was Deceptive Bends (1977), named after a sign on the Mickleham bends on the A24 between Leatherhead and Dorking in Surrey. The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No.3 in Britain and No.31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love" [...] (UK No.6, US No.5), [...] "Good Morning Judge" [...] (UK No.5, US No.69) and [...] "People in Love" [...] (US No.40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: [...] "I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol... we did!" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{she covered}} the 10cc song [...] "The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for Love" [...] for the Mr. Wrong soundtrack, Behind the Eyes was {{released}} in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her [...] "razor blades and Prozac" [...] album. Although [...] "Takes a Little Time" [...] was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. Behind The Eyes was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. The video for [...] "Takes a Little Time" [...] was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up [...] "Behind The Eyes" [...] with A Christmas To Remember, her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Muqata blog on Jewish Press {{removal of}} the book was hypocritical as Amazon {{continues}} to sell The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other materials calling for the erasure of Israel, including those that amount to calls for genocide. [...] "Legal Insurrection", a conservative law blog, also said that banning {{the sale of the}} book wasn't justified, particularly since Amazon continues to sell other blank titles, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and [...] "Free Palestine" [...] merchandise. Conversely Tom Suarez on Mondoweiss wrote whereas the Protocols claim is correct and that one could argue that Amazon is in fact a [...] "common utility", but that [...] " [...] History of the Palestinian People is explicitly intended to reinforce the dehumanization of an entire people in order to grease the machinery of subjugation and ethnic cleansing". Responding to the continuing sale of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion Amazon said [...] "Amazon strongly believes that providing open access to written speech, no matter how hateful or ugly, {{is one of the most}} important <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> And because we think the best remedy for offensive speech is more speech, we also make available to readers the ability to make their own voices heard and express their views about this and all our titles in reviews and ratings".|$|E
