40|$|Mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) are the {{two most}} toxic heavy metals listed among trace elements. Emission limit values for these exist when burning waste in European Union (EU) countries. These {{emission}} limits are also valid for the case of co-combustion of waste fractions with a clean biomass as wood chips originating from stem wood. This has been studied in the 12 MWth boiler located at Chalmers University of Technology by means of co-combustion of municipal sewage sludge and/or sorted, crushed and pre-dried waste pellets from IcoPower in the Netherlands. As base fuel a clean biomass was used consisting of only stem wood in the form of wood chips. Emissions of Hg and Cd were measured in the stack. An evaluation was also made of the importance of a highly efficient <b>textile</b> <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> for the prevention of these emissions. Due to higher concentrations of Hg and Cd in the waste fuel streams, higher loading of Hg and Cd into the boiler was attained. The distribution of Hg and Cd into the outgoing flue-gas and fly ash streams was also determined...|$|E

30|$|In hybrid ESP/BAGs, {{particles}} are pretreated through electrostatic elimination to eliminate certain particles, particularly large ones. The {{rest of the}} charged particles flow along with the gas into the <b>bag</b> <b>filters</b> and are eliminated through interception, inertial collision, and diffusion. Fibers capture fine particles in the <b>bag</b> <b>filter.</b> The advantage of hybrid ESP/BAGs is that the ESP part functions by working with the <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> part. The ESP part has low energy cost. As most {{particles are}} eliminated, the load of the <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> part is reduced and a smaller pressure difference is expected. Thus, {{the cost of the}} hybrid ESP/BAG system is reduced and the elimination efficiency for fine particles is increased. Given that ESPs have limited elimination efficiency for small particles as well as high specific resistivity particles, hybrid ESP/BAGs can increase the elimination efficiency for fine particles.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a laboratory evaluation {{on the strength}} behavior of cement-clay admixture improved by polypropylene fiber. Waste polymer <b>textile</b> <b>bags</b> are harmful {{to the environment and}} sustainable means to reuse them are urgently being sought. A novel method to recycle these waste polymer <b>textile</b> <b>bags</b> is applying them in soft soil improvement projects, such as compacted-pavement base/subbases. In order to verify the effectiveness of fiber bundles used in soil mixing, a series of laboratory investigation are conducted on fiber-reinforced cement-improved soft Shanghai clay. In the tests, two types of polymer fibers were employed; the first one is monofilament polypropylene fiber and the other is fiber bundles split from polymer <b>textile</b> <b>bags.</b> The tests were conducted using unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test after the specimen of fiber-soil-cement admixture were cured for some period. The results show that fiber additive can significantly improve the strength and ductility of the cement treated Shanghai clay. The UCS of fiber-soil-cement admixture is related to both content and length of fiber. Both two kinds of fiber-reinforced cement clay reached their peak strength at fiber content of 0. 5 %. UCS will slowly reverse if the fiber content continues to increase. Even though the polypropylene fiber works better than the fiber bundles, the difference is less than 5 %. These results indicate that the fiber bundles split from polymer bags can be used as the reinforcement in soil mixing, thus providing a novel approach to treat waste polymer <b>textile</b> <b>bags...</b>|$|R

Also, the efficiency of <b>bag</b> <b>filters</b> of Kaolin preparation, Calcinatory, Shamut, Specific mass units were determined in 2008.   Devices M 9096 Particulate Sampling Train and DURAG model (D-RC 80) were used in this research.     Results   the rates of dust concentrations in years 2006 - 9 in Kaolin unit were; 284, 112 and 12. 5 mg/m 3, in Shamout unit were; 120, 140 and 73 mg/m 3, in Calcinatory were; 178, 179 and 173 mg/m 3, in Specific Mass were; 291, 283 and 60 mg/m 3, in Shuttle Furnace were; 14. 7, 14. 3 and 14. 8 and in Extrude Furnace were; 12. 6, 13. 7 and 12. 7 mg/m³.
