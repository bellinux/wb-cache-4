25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump.</b> Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A spiral-grooved <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> {{is widely}} used in vacuum technology. Available rota-tional speed of a rotor becomes larger and larger, and reaches 18, 000 to 50, 000 rpm. The {{clearance}} effect between a rotor and its casing {{is one of the}} important problems for the performance prediction of <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> which operates under very high speed of revolution. Now the pumping performance can be predicted from the computation of the three-dimensional flows. In the present paper, a flow in a spiral groove of <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> is simulated {{on the basis of the}} NS equations to cover a wide range of pressure ratio and mass flow rate. A fully three-dimensional analysis is made to take account of the effect of a gap between a rotor and its casing as well as the centrifugal and Coriolis forces. The pumping performance is shown in comparison with that of the no-gap flow and the channel flow approximations...|$|E
40|$|The {{flow field}} in the <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> is numerically {{analyzed}} by the direct-simulation Monte-Carlo method. The velocity and pressure distribution in the pump is mainly discussed. The performance of single stage pump agrees with the former studies. Even at the steady state, a fast flow exists between the cascade, and some part of this flow goes into the area between blades. The two-dimensional simulation agrees with three-dimensional one when {{the gap between the}} edge of blade and wall is zero. Also this gap makes the velocity distribution very different...|$|E
40|$|The KATRIN {{experiment}} will {{probe the}} neutrino mass {{by measuring the}} beta-electron energy spectrum near the endpoint of tritium beta-decay. An integral energy analysis will be performed by an electro-static spectrometer (Main Spectrometer), an ultra-high vacuum vessel with a length of 23. 2 m, a volume of 1240 m^ 3, and a complex inner electrode system with about 120000 individual parts. The strong magnetic field that guides the beta-electrons is provided by super-conducting solenoids {{at both ends of}} the spectrometer. Its influence on <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and vacuum gauges had to be considered. A system consisting of 6 <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and 3 km of non-evaporable getter strips has been deployed and was tested during the commissioning of the spectrometer. In this paper the configuration, the commissioning with bake-out at 300 C, and the performance of this system are presented in detail. The vacuum system has to maintain a pressure in the 10 ^- 11 mbar range. It is demonstrated that the performance of the system is already close to these stringent functional requirements for the KATRIN experiment, which will start at the end of 2016.

The device operates stably under high vacuum conditions at rotational frequencies limited only by commercial dc motor capabilities. Tuning the rotational frequency allows selective scanning over a broad velocity band. The width of the selected velocity distributions at full-width-half-maximum is as narrow as a few percent of the selected mean velocity and independent of the rotational speed of the selector.

This sensor speciﬁcally applies to the control and safe operation of <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> The sensing element consists of a “magnetic capsule”, composed of a quasi-ideal permanent magnet with high Curie temperature and a Fe–Ni alloy cylinder, mounted on the rotor, and a detecting coil stuck on the pump frame,where a voltage pulse is induced at every turn by {{the passage of the}} capsule. It is demonstrated that the sensor can be designed so as to have a linear voltage-versus-temperature behaviour, where the signal strength depends on the distance between the revolving magnet and a ﬁxed pickup coil and is independent of rotor speed...|$|R
30|$|For sublimation, {{we used a}} high {{temperature}} furnace from Jipelec [31] previously dedicated to post-implantation annealing. It was rf-induction heated and fitted with a <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump.</b> The vacuum limit reached in this way was 10 - 6 Torr. Before sublimation, the samples were heated at 1150 °C for 10 min to remove any trace of native oxide. During the growth, the samples were covered by a graphite cap to increase the C and Si partial pressures over the SiC surface. Such graphite coverage lowers the Si out-diffusion process during the growth and enables to perform FLG growth at higher temperature. This promotes better SiC surface reconstruction.|$|E

The Vacuum laboratory, a part of first year M.

The proposed laboratory will help both the graduate and under graduate students of our institute to conduct different experiments under vacuum environment. Two experiments using rotary pump [1] namely; Pumping speed measurement and conductance measurement of different piping analogy need to be set up. For which we designed a vacuum chamber [3] with suitable capacity first, decided pump down time allowable to get ultimate vacuum level of a rotary pump {{in accordance with the}} total lab hrs assigned to each sessions, and finally we calculated pumping speed [2] required for the pump.

The two dimensional simulation shows these results : 1) Even at the steady state of the pump, some unsteady now exists at the area between the rotor and stator. 2) In the pump with a rotor stage and a stator stage, the relative velocity is not similar because of the boundary condition of discharge side. 3) The maximum pressure ratio is effected by the time-averaged flow in the pump. 4) Intermolecular collision makes the maximum pressure ratio small at Kn < 10, but the discharge time is not affected by the molecular collision. 5) In the pump with many stages, the flow becomes almost similar when the shape of blades are same...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are commonly}} used in <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> because of their suitability for high speed and contamination free operations. A five-axis turbo molecular pump with two radial and one axial magnetic bearing is considered in this paper. The effect of the bias current on the energy consumption for both unidirectional and differential control current strategies is studied. It is shown that optimising the bias current according to operational conditions is beneficial. A differential current control gives better efficiency compared with a unidirectional approach when the bias current is variable. The optimum bias current {{is a function of}} the desired bearing stiffness and the rotor vibration amplitudes. The desired bearing stiffness is a function of rotor vibration levels or transmitted forces. A fuzzy logic controller is set up to resolve the conflicting control requirements.

30|$|A {{schematic}} {{overview of}} the argon beamline is shown in Fig.  3. A supersonic argon beam is formed by releasing a high pressure (∼ 4 bar) gas into vacuum by a pulsed solenoid valve (Even Lavie type E.L.- 5 - 2005 RT, HRR [40]) running at two times the cyclotron frequency of the synchrotron (153 – 175 Hz). To help keep the pressure in the source chamber below 1 × 10 − 4 mbar, an additional <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> provides a pre-vacuum of < 5 × 10 − 4 mbar to the turbo pumps of the source and detection chambers. The 5 mm diameter skimmer between the source and detection chambers and the 1.5 mm diameter skimmer between the detection and the synchrotron chambers select only the coldest part of the argon beam and ensures that the pressure in the synchrotron chamber remains below 2.2 × 10 − 8 mbar during operation.|$|E
30|$|These {{limitations}} were overcome when pulsed gas sources {{became available}} [10 – 16]. If the gas pulse is short enough (shorter than a typical molecular reflection {{time from the}} walls of the vacuum chamber), and if the repetition rate is low enough to so that the mean gas pressure is less than 10 − 5 mbars in the source chamber, then the gas expands without hindrance, and no structured shock waves interfere with the jet propagation. Much smaller <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> (300 – 500  l/sec) can now be used for low repetition rate experiments (10 - 50 Hz), while bigger pumps (3000  l/sec) are still required for higher repetition rates (1 – 5 KHz) pulsed valve systems. The following parts will summarize our experience with one type of a pulsed valve that we developed, and is still the only one that can be used over a very wide temperature scale (40 - 5500  K). The valve is an electro- magnetic actuated device. Readily available computer simulation programs can now be used to optimize the electro- magnetic structure, the mechanical movement dynamics, the nozzle shape and the interaction of the high density resulting jet with skimmers. These processes will be explained and experimental results will be shown. These valves, known as the “Even-Lavie” valves are now widely used in more than 100 labs. Some details have been published before [17].|$|R
40|$|A new {{apparatus}} {{was constructed}} to examine gas-, atom- and Plasma-driven permeation of hydrogen isotopes through group VA metal membranes with precisely controlled surface states. Absorption and desorption experiments are also possible. The new apparatus {{consists of two}} vacuum chambers, an upstream chamber and a downstream chamber, separated by a specimen membrane. Both chambers are evacuated by <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and sputter-ion pumps. The upstream chamber is equipped with Ta filaments serving as atomizers in atom-driven permeation experiments and cathodes in plasma-driven permeation experiments. The specimen membrane is formed into a tubular and electrically isolated from the chamber. Hence, ohmic heating of the membrane is possible, and this feature of the membrane is suitable for surface cleaning by high-temperature heating and impurity doping for the control of surface chemical composition through surface segregation. Both chambers were evacuated to 1 x 10 - 7 Pa after baking. The main component of residual gas was H 2, and the partial pressures of impurity gases other than H 2 were ca. 1 x 10 - 8 Pa. Gas- and atom-driven permeation experiments were successfully carried out with hydrogen gas for Nb membrane activated by heating in vacuum at 1173 K. Superpermeation was observed in the atom-driven permeation experiments. Absorption experiments with a clean surface were also carried out. The surface was, however, cleaned only partially, because the temperature distribution was not uniform during high-temperature heating. Nevertheless, surface cleanliness was retained during absorption experiments under the present vacuum conditions. A new membrane assembly that will enable a uniform temperature distribution is now under construction...|$|R
40|$|Now the {{molecular}} vacuum pumps (MVP) {{are widely used}} in the modern industry. Upon analysis of vacuum engineering at the modern market {{it is possible to}} draw a conclusion that this equipment is one of the leaders among the high-vacuum pumping means, especially when using in combination with the axial steps of <b>turbo-molecular</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> (TMP) containing compound flowing part.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} sensor, the Leybold Inficon ComposerTM, {{was implemented}} downstream to a production-scale tungsten {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) cluster tool for in-situ process sensing. Process gases were sampled at the outlet of the reactor chamber and compressed with a <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> and mechanical pump from the sub-Torr process pressure regime to above 50 Torr as required for gas sound velocity measurements in the acoustic cavity. The high molecular weight gas WF 6 mixed with H 2 provides a substantial molecular weight contrast so that the acoustic sensing method appears especially sensitive to WF 6 concentration. By monitoring the resonant frequency of exhaust process gases, the depletion of WF 6 resulting from the reduction by H 2 was readily observed in the 0. 5 Torr process for wafer temperatures ranging from 300 to 350 C. Despite WF 6 depletion rates as low as 3 - 5 %, in-situ wafer-state metrology was achieved with an error less than 6 % over 17 processed wafers.

40|$|The Holweck pump is {{a device}} {{widely used in}} many pumping systems. It can be a self-standing device or part of a {{multi-stage}} system, usually combined with a <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> (TMP). In the present work, an existing methodology [Sharipov et al., 2006] for the simulation of a Holweck pump with channels of constant cross sections, is extended and becomes more general by including pumps with tapered channels. The implemented procedure {{is based on the}} kinetic approach, is applicable in the whole range of the Knudsen number and is divided into two steps. First the flow through a tapered channel of a T-shape cross section is decomposed in four simple two-dimensional flows and a database for the dimensionless flow rate in terms of the reference gas rarefaction and the channel geometrical data is built based on linear kinetic theory. Then, using the mass conservation principal and the kinetic database, an ordinary differential equation is solved to yield the pressure evolution along the pump and the pump characteristic quantities of practical interest. Comparison of simulation results with existing experimental data has shown good agreement, proving the validity of the method and its capability of simulating the flow in a Holweck pump with small computational effort. In addition, the great advantage of the method for fast and easy-to-go parametric and sensitivity analysis concerning various operational and geometrical characteristics of the pump is demonstrated.

30|$|The single SiNW {{devices were}} {{electrically}} characterized at various temperature ranging from 100 to 300  K; the measurements were {{performed in a}} thermally controlled environment (Janis ST- 100 H cryostat) consisting of a cold finger column inserted in a vacuum chamber. The samples were mounted on the holder {{at the end of}} the cold finger, and a thin Kapton film (12.5  μm) was placed between the samples and the holder to ensure electrical insulation of the circuit while providing a good thermal contact. The vacuum chamber was connected to a scroll pump (Varian SH- 100) and to a <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> (Alcatel ATP 80), leading to a residual pressure around 10 − 5 mbar. The value of temperature was acquired with a platinum Pt- 100 resistor embedded into the cold finger, while a controller (Lake-Shore 331), coupled with a heater and a liquid nitrogen transfer-line, tuned the temperature to the set-point value. Kapton-covered cables inside the chamber provided electrical wiring of the samples to external coaxial plugs. We used a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp SourceMeter with remote preamplifier for electrical measurement; external noises were minimized using a short triaxial cable connected to the coaxial plugs of the cryostat through a specific adapter. The SourceMeter system provides three signal terminals, namely Hi and Low terminals for the electrical measurement and the Guard terminal for the guard ring circuit. The two main signals were connected to the probe pads of the single SiNW devices, while the guard terminal was bonded to the backside of the samples to avoid any current leakage in the substrate.|$|E

Gas xenon (Xe 4, 8, with the percentage of xenon 99, 9988 %) was used as working gas It ffreezes to copper anode plate cooled to a temperature of 45 - 50 K. As a test materials were selected D 16 aluminum alloy and stainless austenitic steel 12 X 18 H 10 T (cryogenic constructional steel) having wide practical application. Micro-topography surface and X-ray photoelectron spectra of samples were obtained at an atomic force microscope Solver PRO-M and the electron spectrometer ESCALAB- 5 (line Kα Al (hν = 1486. 6 eV)). The impact of short-pulsed ion beam on a sample of D 16 alloy and stainless steel 12 X 18 H 10 T leads to erosion of the surface in the form of separate craters, the depth of which depends on the hardness of the material and the number of pulses. Uniform over the surface area distribution of craters can be achieved when placed in front of target fine-mesh nets of a refractory metal such as molybdenum.

30|$|Before {{presenting}} the results, we will briefly describe the experimental methods. Al nanorods are grown using {{electron beam evaporation}} PVD at varied vacuum levels and varied substrate temperatures. First, Si { 100 } substrates (Nova Electronic Materials, Flower Mound, TX, USA) are ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and de-ionized water (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and are subsequently placed onto a precision machined mount, for GLAD, {{at the top of}} the vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is a stainless steel tank that is approximately 40 -cm tall and 25  cm in diameter - the source to substrate distance is approximately 30  cm. The source material 99.99 % Al (Kurt J. Lesker, Jefferson Hills, PA, USA) is placed in a graphite liner in the electron beam source at the base of the vacuum chamber. For deposition at 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 2  Pa, the high vacuum stage, a <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump,</b> is engaged for only 5  min, after the roughing pressure has been reached; the base pressure reaches 5 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 [*]Pa, and the working pressure is 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 2  Pa. The electron beam is then engaged and the deposition rate is monitored and controlled at 1.0  nm/s, via quartz crystal microbalance, to a total nominal thickness of 500  nm. The thickness is measured perpendicular to the source flux, and the measurement represents that of a continuous film. For deposition at 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 5  Pa, the chamber is allowed to remain under high vacuum pumping for 24  h to reach a base pressure of 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 5 [*]Pa. To further improve the vacuum, the substrate is blocked from flux via a shutter and chromium (Cr) is deposited onto the chamber walls using the electron beam source. After the deposition of Cr, the base pressure is further improved to 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 6  Pa; the working pressure during deposition is 1 [*]× 10 - 5  Pa. To reach a substrate temperature of 225  K, liquid nitrogen is flowed into the substrate holding fixture and the substrate temperature is measured with K-type thermocouple. The fixture and substrate are allowed to equilibrate to 225  K, and liquid nitrogen is added periodically to maintain the temperature, within a range of 200 to 250  K.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on {{the development of a new}} experimental apparatus that combines two powerful techniques: Chirped-Pulse Fourier-Transform Microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy and uniform supersonic flows. This combination promises a nearly universal detection method that can deliver quantitative isomer, conformer, and vibrational level specific detection; characterize unstable reaction products and intermediates; and perform unique spectroscopic, kinetics and dynamics measurements. Thus, a new high-power Ka band (26 – 40 GHz) chirped pulse spectrometer with sub-MHz resolution was designed and constructed. In order to study smaller molecules, E-band (60 – 90 GHz) capabilities were also added to the spectrometer. A novel strategy for generating a pulsed uniform supersonic flow through a Laval nozzle is introduced. A new high-throughput pulsed piezoelectric stack valve was constructed and used to produce a cold (20 K) uniform flow with large volumes and densities (~ 1016 molecules cm- 3). The uniform flow conditions for two of noble gases (argon and helium) were characterized using impact pressure measurements and rotational diagrams. It was demonstrated that a flow uniformity extending as far as 20 cm from the Laval nozzle exit can be achieved with a single compound <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> to maintain the operating pressure. Two benchmark reactive systems were used to illustrate and characterize the performance of the new apparatus CPUF: the photodissociation of SO 2 at 193 nm, for which the vibrational populations of the SO product are monitored, and the reaction between CN and C 2 H 2, for which the HCCCN product is detected in its vibrational ground-state. The results show that the combination also provides insight into the vibrational and rotational relaxation kinetics of the nascent reaction products. CPUF has been used to determine product branching in a multichannel reaction. This work, the CN + CH 3 CCH reaction was found to yield HCN via a direct H-abstraction reaction, while indirect addition/elimination pathways to HC 3 N, CH 3 C 3 N, and H 2 C 3 HCN were also probed. From these observations, quantitative branching ratios were established for all products as 12 (5) %, 66 (4) %, 22 (6) % and 0 (8) % into HCN, HC 3 N, CH 3 C 3 N, and H 2 C 3 HCN, respectively. The values are consistent with statistical calculations based on new ab initio results at the CBS-QB 3 level of theory. New designer chirp schemes were developed for CPUF, targeting broader applications through reduced data acquisition time and enhanced signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{is focused}} on quantitative identification of gas permeation in inorganic, micro-porous glass membranes. The pore size diameter of the membranes was in the range between 1. 5 ± 5 nm. The complex mechanism of gas transport in these membranes is still not well understood, however, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion and configurational diffusion {{can be considered as}} rate controlling mechanisms. Two different versions of experiments were used for measuring gas permeabilities through the membranes: (a) dynamic and (b) steady state ones. (a) The round, flat membrane was located between the upper and lower gas chamber. The gas stream passed the upper chamber with constant flow rate at atmospheric pressure. The lower chamber initially was at approximately zero pressure and as gas penetrated through the membrane, the pressure was increasing and was recorded with a sensitive pressure gauge. The temperature had been varied from 295 K to 475 K. (b) The upper chamber was fed with gas at constant pressure slightly above atmospheric pressure, while from the lower chamber gas was pumped off with a strong <b>turbo-molecular</b> <b>pump</b> connected to a mass spectrometer. The steady state flux was established very quickly. Conditions allowed measurements at temperature from 295 to 413 K. The dynamic and steady state experiments gave similar values of the effective permeabilities. Permeabilities of He, Ar, N 2, CO 2 and C 3 H 8 have been measured. In order to describe the observations, anticipating ideal Knudsen diffusion was a first attempt. But {{it turned out that the}} separation factors between the various gases were much bigger than expected. Based on the observed permeability data, ideal selectivity coefficients were calculated for each of gas in comparison with He. Comparing the selectivities from Fig. 1 one may see that the selectivity factors are much higher than those for Knudsen separation at lower temperature and with increasing the temperature, factors are decreasing to Knudsen ratio. Consequently, activated diffusion [1] had also to be considered. For membranes of small pore sizes, so-called surface flow due to activated diffusion can be another additional mechanism, because of strong interactions between gas molecules and the pore walls. Therefore, also the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules became an additional parameter. Even inert gases can be adsorbed on these membranes [2]. This statement was confirmed by experimental results showing that permeabilities at higher temperatures become Knudsen-diffusion controlled, while at lower temperatures strong deviations from Knudsen-behavior were observed. It seems that gases have been really adsorbed at the surface. These data could be helpful to clarify the mechanisms by which gases may be separated by micro-porous glass membranes. To describe these observations the concept of potential barrier between the gas molecules and the solid surface was applied. That means if the molecule after collision has a kinetic energy bigger than the surface potential energy, it passes the potential surface field, and such a flow is called gas-phase flow. When molecules can not pass through the force field they again collide with the surface. The flow of these molecules is called surface flow [3]. To eliminate surface flow for extracting the tortuosity factor free from effects of surface diffusion and adsorption, experiments were performed at higher temperatures. Based on the differences between permeabilities of different gases, tortuosity and potential barrier can be fitted. At lower temperatures the adsorption and surface diffusion can be obtained as the difference between total flux and gas flux [4]. Both versions of experiments give us a lot of information aiming at to quantify mass transfer processes in micro-porous media, better understanding of surface flow in nano-separation facilities and to predict the separation effects to be expected. Further work is currently focused on studying membranes with different pore sizes in the nanometer range or different type and magnitude of surface area in order to distinguish various adsorption effects. These micro-porous membranes might have a greater potential for gas separation compared to membranes with larger pores. [1] SHELEKIN A. B., DIXON A. G., MA Y.
