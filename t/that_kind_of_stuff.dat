25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and all <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> I just look at it as music.

Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> and I've never really watched procedurals.

Users now instantiate a Corpus object with methods for parsing, interrogating and concordancing. Interrogations output Interrogation objects, which have methods for editing, plotting, saving, etc. Another major update is that the concordance() method takes the same core arguments as the interrogate() method. This means that users can quickly check that their interrogation is counting what they think it is. There have also been some bugfixes, documentation updates, and <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> usual <b>stuff...</b>|$|R

Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> She was really in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E
500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's just different choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> without seeming somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

5000|$|One {{account of}} Dylan's first {{experience}} with psychedelics places it in April 1964; producer Paul Rothchild told Bob Spitz that he was present when Dylan took his first hit of LSD. By February 1964, Dylan was already telling his friends that [...] "Rimbaud's where it's at. <b>That's</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> means something. <b>That's</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> writing I'm gonna do." [...] A nineteenth-century French poet, Rimbaud once wrote to his mentor Georges Izambard that [...] "the poet makes himself a seer by a long, prodigious and rational disordering of the senses … He reaches for the unknown and even if, crazed, he ends up by losing the understanding of his visions, at least he has seen them." [...] (Dated May 1871) Dylan's early experimentation with hallucinogens has often been connected with the dramatic development his songwriting would soon take, but Dylan himself has denied any connection.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} February 4, 1978 edition of NME, Debbie Harry expressed her affinity for the Euro disco music of Giorgio Moroder, stating that [...] "It's commercial, but it's good, it says something... <b>that's</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I want to do". A notable example {{of this type of}} musical experimentation occurred when Blondie covered Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] at the Blitz Benefit on May 7, 1978. In his history of CBGB, music writer Roman Kozak described this event: [...] "When Blondie played for the Johnny Blitz benefit in May, 1978, they surprised everyone with a rendition of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. It was arguably the first time in New York, {{in the middle of the}} great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born." ...|$|R

2500|$|Following a 2001 {{membership}} vote, {{the group}} {{changed its name}} to Commemorative Air Force effective January 1, 2002. Many felt the name Confederate Air Force was confusing, did not accurately reflect the purpose of the organization, and was detrimental to fundraising efforts. This name change was deemed by some fans to be a move of political correctness. According to CAF chief of staff Ray Kinney, [...] "In many people's minds, the word 'confederacy' brings up the image of slavery and discrimination. We, in no way, are associated with <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> So, it gives us, in a way, a black-eye." ...|$|E

He continued, [...] "I think what makes it feel new is the fact that we’re showing you can be both. We’re showing that you can do Ralph Ellison at the same times as you’re doing Chester Himes." [...] Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as [...] "Martin Scorsese is with the rock 'n' roll references like in Casino or in Goodfellas", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it. He highlighted the use of [...] "I'm Bad Like Jesse James" [...] in the seventh episode, which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years, that [...] "builds up and coincides with the explosion that happens on screen and it’s so subtle. <b>That’s</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I geek out over." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band’s way {{of mixing}} pop and avant-garde music met with much {{critical}} acclaim. [...] "Braids' uniquely feminine experimental pop {{is largely a}} success", argued Allmusic, mentioning Animal Collective, Björk, Karen O, Cocteau Twins, Siouxsie Sioux, and Yeasayer as possible influences. According to Spin, the album [...] "pairs glimmering, pastoral post-rock with foul-mouthed lyrics", making this girl's psyche preparation a fascinating thing to watch. [...] "This is a band that is all about abstraction, experimentation and, most important, obfuscation", a Prefix reviewer remarked. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork noted the peculiarity of the quartet's brand of dream pop, saying, [...] "There are dreams, there are nightmares, {{and then there are}} those night visions that don't quite qualify as either, the unnerving images and dialogues that rattle about your head in your waking life {{for the rest of the}} day and reveal strange, forgotten details every time you pick at them. <b>That's</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> we need to be talking about if we're going to call Braids 'dream-pop' as so many others have".|$|R

[...] When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with a substantial portion of a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style.

Kevin Carr of FilmThreat.com said on the gun action in Open Range: [...] "After The Matrix redefined action in the late 1990s, every crummy action sequence tries to repeat the power of 'bullet time' often with little success.

In {{contrast}} with ontology developers concerned with a symbolic or digital environment (e. g. the internet), I {{draw attention to}} some features of our 3 -D spatio-temporal environment that challenge young humans and other intelligent animals and will also challenge future robots. Evolution provides most animals with an ontology that suffices for life, whereas some animals, including humans also have mechanisms for substantive ontology extension based on results of interacting with the environment. Future human-like robots will also need this. Since pre-verbal human children and many intelligent non-human animals, including hunting mammals, nest-building birds and primates can interact, often creatively, with complex structures and processes in a 3 -D environment, that suggests (a) that they use ontologies <b>that</b> include <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> material (<b>stuff),</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> structure, <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> relationship, <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> process and <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> causal interaction and (b) since they don’t use a human communicative languag...|$|R
