The wingtips were rounded rather than squared off and the wings given a slight forward stagger.

This study, on the Ngenge watershed, Mount Elgon, was aimed at developing policy for the implementation of a new strategy for solving the problem, Integrated Watershed Management (IWM). For policy development, a user-friendly method for assessing erosion risk - using rainfall, slope and NDVI - enabled identifying priority areas for interventions, and a stakeholder analysis enabled identifying key stakeholders who participated in multilevel workshops for deliberating on appropriate interventions. In these workshops social learning was stimulated through constructing scenarios and developing action and work plans which are to inform policy.

The study has three distinct parts. It firstly explores the treatment of metaphor within the framework of Relevance Theory.

We have argued that as far as instruction depends much on the learners’ emergent needs for learning, we as teachers cannot preset the length of the assistance they need during the learning process, especially in advanced cognitive operations or when, as Widdowson (2003) put it aptly, learners are in “continual conceptual adaptation” by encoding rules and conventions for their use through sustained modifications, extensions, realignments, or abandonments, a situation that he calls to be “a process of recurrent unlearning and relearning” (p. 141). In addition, we cannot claim that the input we provide the student with is the same type of assistance he needs because, after all, the learner is constantly modifying the input <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> the missing knowledge. There are times when the input fails as well. Moreover, the teachers or peers are not aware of the other student’s load of attention useful to manipulate the input and the other possible ZPDs the very learner is making during that time of input modification.|$|E

The government of a country involved in war has to find new sources of finance to cover the high costs of labour and materials for the war effort which does not satisfy the civilian needs. Initially, the government would resort to heavier taxation coupled with the floating of loans to raise more revenue. But the total cost of war is very heavy and the revenue accruing to the state through sources docs not suffice. Taxation, one of the sources of increased revenue, cannot be increased to any level because too heavy a tax can affect the ability and desire to work and save, and thus have adverse affect on production. So in order to obtain additional resources from the society the government would have to resort to printing more currency or borrow from the central bank against its own securities. Both these sources of increased revenue have an inflationary effect...|$|E

The report {{addresses}} data collected by the Agency for 24 basin sites in Cheshire. At least two samples were collected from each site, though not simultaneously. Sites were visited in May/June and in November. The determinands are standard and they included: water, temperature, conductivity, pH, DO, fractional white light penetration, TSS, chlorophyll, TP, ortho-phosphate, nitrate-, nitrite-, ammonium and silicate. Though concentrations were often higher than for other lakes in the region, rather exceeding criteria for classification as eutrophic lakes, the results confirmed that the series of lakes is, naturally, highly eutrophic and nothing in the present data differs so far from expectation that is persuasive that the ecosystems are reacting adversely to environmental stress. The data set is review and summarised, site-by-site, in an appendix. The grounds for prioritisation are discussed.

The authors base this hypothesis on the importance and religious-political significance of the unity palatium-circus in late antique Imperial capitals - theme developed in this same context by G.

40|$|What {{forms the}} {{cultural}} {{identity of a}} city? As architectural historian and theorist, I will apply this question to the “Baukultur”, this German term, {{on the one hand}} heavily loaded {{and on the other hand}} virtually impossible to translate. “Baukultur” stands for a culture of architecture and the built environment in its entirety. Thus I will ask: how can the identity of a city be defined via its built culture? This notion of Baukultur is less narrow in its definition than one would most likely expect to see in Wismar, a town so heavily focussed on its status as UNESCO World Heritage. Is not the city as a whole in its built development a testimony to past and present architectural culture? If this is so, a discussion of built culture needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> what has marked and continues to mark the development of a city, rather than asking for the ‘beautiful’ constituents of the city. As Aldo Rossi did in his 1966 Architecture of the City, we will follow the notion of typology as defining element and of the ‘tessuto’, the fabric as a quasi-sculptural basic element of the city. Please allow me to answer the question regarding built culture via a brief investigation of Auckland, hoping that this may stimulate reflections on this very question in Wismar...|$|E
