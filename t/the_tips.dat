40|$|Abstract. A thick tip foil blade was {{designed}} to reduce <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow and weaken <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> vortexes in ducted propeller 19 A/Ka 4 - 55. <b>The</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil was constructed by normal extrusion of <b>the</b> original <b>tip</b> foil. <b>The</b> maximum thickness of the foil increased from 1. 64 % chord length to 7. 64 %. The commercial CFD code CFX was employed to simulate the flow field of the two ducted propellers. From the performance curves, it could be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> foil thickening will not affect the thrust and torque of the ducted propeller much. <b>The</b> <b>tip</b> leakage vortex (TLV) in <b>the</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller was obviously weaker than that in the original propeller. The pressure drop in TLV middle chord position decreased by 32. 8 %. In <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance, both propellers have <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance vortex. <b>The</b> difference is that <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance vortex in <b>the</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller could form an expansionary channel in <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance, which made <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow slow down, and hence weaken the TLV...|$|R
25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to a substrate. Initially <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and <b>the</b> surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to <b>the</b> surface. These <b>tips</b> can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} to predict the induced velocities at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> vortex in <b>the</b> wake of a hovering helicopter rotor.

50|$|For {{the second}} case, a {{model with a}} {{vertically}} grown nanowire stacked between the ohmic contact at its bottom and the schottky contact at its top is considered. When the force is applied toward <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of <b>the</b> nanowire, the uniaxial compressive is generated in the nanowire. Due to the piezoelectric effect, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of <b>the</b> nanowire will have a negative piezoelectric potential, increasing the Fermi level at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> Since <b>the</b> electrons will then flow from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to <b>the</b> bottom through the external circuit as a result, the positive electrical potential will be generated at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> <b>The</b> schottky contact will barricade the electrons being transported through the interface, therefore maintaining the potential at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> As <b>the</b> force is removed, the piezoelectric effect diminishes, and the electrons will be flowing {{back to the top}} in order to neutralize the positive potential at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> <b>The</b> second case will generate alternating current output signal.|$|R

5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae.

5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of the feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>tips,</b> and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during {{the heat of the}} day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  4 a, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is {{initially}} placed above the vacancy site with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> height of 8  Å {{at which the}} tip-surface interaction is almost negligible. As <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> approaches <b>the</b> surface step by step, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> apex atom, i.e., the dopant atom, relaxes toward the up terrace due to the strong attraction. When <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> reaches <b>the</b> height of 7.1  Å, as demonstrated in Figure  4 b, the dopant atom shows an obvious movement toward the up terrace since the attraction is strong enough. At this moment, two up-terrace atoms are pulled up slightly and {{in contact with the}} dopant atom (see Figure  4 b). After that, we move <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> laterally in <b>the</b> X direction in a step of 0.2  Å at a constant height. As <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> moves forward, as shown in Figure  4 c, the dopant atom drops gradually because of the decreasing vertical attraction from <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> In <b>the</b> end, the dopant atom is released successfully from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and adsorbed at the step site (see Figure  4 d).

40|$|Tip leakage {{flow field}} in a {{transonic}} axial compressor rotor, NASA Rotor 37, were investigated by large-scale numerical sim-ulations. Unsteady three-dimensional flow simulations were con-ducted by solving the compressible RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) equations with k-w turbulence model using an implicit high-resolution upwind {{scheme based on}} a TVD formu-lation.

40|$|We present first-principles total-energy electronic-structure {{calculations}} {{that provide}} the microscopic mechanism of the Ag atom diffusion between the half unit cells (HUCs) on the Si(111) -(7 x 7) surface with and without <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of <b>the</b> atomic force microscope (AFM). We find that, without the presence of <b>the</b> AFM <b>tip,</b> <b>the</b> diffusions between the two HUCs are almost symmetric with the energy barrier of about 1 eV in the both directions. The diffusion is a two-step process with an intermediate metastable configuration in which the Ag atom is at the boundary of the HUCs. With the presence of <b>the</b> <b>tip,</b> {{we find that the}} reaction pathways are essentially the same, but the energy barrier in one direction is substantially reduced to be 0. 2 - 0. 4 eV by <b>the</b> <b>tip,</b> while that of the diffusion in the reverse direction remains larger than 1 eV. <b>The</b> Si <b>tip</b> reduces <b>the</b> energy barrier more than <b>the</b> Pt <b>tip</b> due to <b>the</b> flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> apex structure. In addition to the reduction of <b>the</b> barrier, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> traps <b>the</b> diffusing adatom preventing the diffusion in the reverse direction.
