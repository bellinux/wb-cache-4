Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F.

5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may be <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> weather held back its spread.|$|E
25|$|The {{shortage}} of the lowest-eccentricity objects predicted in the Nice model may indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> population formed in situ. In {{addition to their}} differing orbits the hot and cold populations have but differing colors. The cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting it has a different composition and formed in a different region. The cold population also includes {{a large number of}} binary objects with loosely bound orbits that would be unlikely to survive close encounter with Neptune. If the cold population formed at its current location, preserving it would require that Neptune's eccentricity remained small, or that its perihelion precessed rapidly due to a strong interaction between it and Uranus.|$|E

This forecast actually contradicted what the US and Canadian Weather Bureaus were forecasting at the time. Pan American's meteorologist revised his forecast at 12:39 PM, {{but there was no}} indication that Flight 923 received the information. The updated forecast called for the cold front to reach Annette Island at 4:00 PM PST, but still made no mention of turbulence.|$|E

25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, for an update on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed.

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there is much to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} currently most popular model, the [...] "Nice model", reproduces many characteristics of the Kuiper belt such as the [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "hot" [...] populations, resonant objects, and a scattered disc, but it still fails to account {{for some of the}} characteristics of their distributions. The model predicts a higher average eccentricity in classical KBO orbits than is observed (0.10–0.13 versus 0.07) and its predicted inclination distribution contains too few high inclination objects. In addition, the frequency of binary objects in the cold belt, many of which are far apart and loosely bound, also poses a problem for the model. These are predicted to have been separated during encounters with Neptune, leading some to propose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> disc formed at its current location, representing the only truly local population of small bodies in the solar system.|$|E

500|$|A {{multitude}} of reasons {{contributed to the}} ultimate cancellation of the RAH-66 program. According to aviation author James Williams, efforts {{to speed up the}} program via the elimination of risk-mitigation measures and the stream of continuous adjustments to account for annual budget cuts to the rotorcraft resulted in the formation of a negative cycle that functioned to greatly extend the rotorcraft's development schedule. Over the course of the Comanche's development, multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of helicopters that were intended to be ordered; one particularly common basis for such curtailments was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War had ended and thus such quantities were unnecessary (a phenomenon known as the [...] "Peace Dividend"). However, significant reductions in volume directly resulted in the rapid climbs in the projections of the Comanche's unit cost; in turn, this stimulated and gave validity to critics of the program, such as the Army Acquisition Executive James Ambrose, who had prominently declared that the Army would not receive any aircraft [...] "costing a dollar over $7.5 million".|$|E
500|$|... "Tunguska" [...] and its {{follow-up}} [...] "Terma" [...] {{were conceived}} by the writers {{when they were}} trying to conceive a [...] "big and fun canvas" [...] to tell stories. They decided to create a story connected to the Russian gulags, which led to the [...] "natural" [...] idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the black oil. Series writer John Shiban felt it was natural to create an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War had ended a few years earlier. The writers desired to expand the series' mythology globally, a concept that continued into the fifth season and the series' 1998 feature film adaptation. The idea of a conspiracy with a global reach was first broached in the series' second season, [...] and it was felt that this two-part story was a good place to expand upon this, allowing the production crew to [...] "stretch the limits" [...] of their resources and imagination. The inspiration for the oil-containing rocks was NASA's announcement of possible evidence of extraterrestrial life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite; while the gulag scenes were based on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.|$|E
500|$|During his trial, Berger {{claimed that}} he had not been aware of the Final Solution until after the war, but the {{prosecution}} produced evidence that he had been present at the first of Himmler's infamous 1943 Posen speeches in which the Reichsfuhrer-SS had explicitly spoken of the extermination of Jews. Berger's defence counsel claimed that his client did not believe the word [...] "extermination" [...] had been used by Himmler with regard to Jews during the speech. Berger's lawyer went on in an attempt to mitigate Berger's actions by claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War bore strong parallels to the Nazi fight against [...] "Jews and Bolsheviks", and the possibility that the US would also have to fight the Soviet Union in the near future. During the war, Berger wrote in an article, [...] "We the National Socialists believe the Fuhrer when he says that the annihilation of Jewry in Europe stands {{at the end of the}} fight instigated by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his strongest enemy." [...] Berger and others also claimed that the unit commanded by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, although when the text of Himmler's second Posen speech was uncovered in 1953, it [...] "cast dubious light" [...] on Berger's claim.
