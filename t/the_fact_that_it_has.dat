5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts {{are under way to}} control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the highest melting point {{of all the}} elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, {{comparable to that of}} uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed {{that she could be}} considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E

25|$|In January–April 2000, Queen of Scandinavia was rebuilt by Remontowa in Gdynia, Poland, with rear {{sponsons}} and, again, a new sleeker bow. The new bow {{is especially}} notable due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no gate or visor, hence the ship's car decks can now only be loaded/unloaded from the rear. Also, a new {{marine evacuation system}} was added on deck 9. All the other life rafts were removed, and the new evacuation system features a chute instead.|$|E

25|$|The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, {{commonly}} {{known by its}} abbreviation PSLV, is an expendable launch system developed by ISRO to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun synchronous orbits. PSLV can also launch small satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The reliability and versatility of the PSLV is proven by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> launched, as of 2014, 71 satellites/spacecraft (31 Indian and 40 foreign) {{into a variety of}} orbits. The maximum number of satellites launched by the PSLV in a single launch is 104, in the PSLV-C37 launch on 15 February 2017.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture, though it is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves save for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf {{by the fact that}} it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail. After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.|$|E
25|$|Hyperion's {{surface is}} covered with deep, {{sharp-edged}} craters that give it {{the appearance of a}} giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.|$|E

Greek, for example, gamma is written as Latin g, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the alphabetic position of c; Hebrew bet, the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter b, is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is written b or v accordingly; Russian ts is written as c, which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic f is written as f, despite being historically p, and occurring {{in that part of the}} Arabic alphabet (between historic o and q).|$|E

25|$|Milan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} clubs in Italy, having won a total of 30 major domestic trophies, and was the most successful club in the world in terms of international trophies with 18 trophies until February 2014, when Al Ahly SC claimed that title (now this title is claimed by Real Madrid with 23 official international trophies). It is now the third-most successful club behind Real Madrid (23) and Al Ahly (20). Milan has earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> won at least ten scudetti. In addition, the club is permanently allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt as it has won more than five European Championship Cups.|$|E

500|$|The {{protective}} sign of {{the hammer}} was worn by women, as we know from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been found in women's graves.

[...] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.|$|E
