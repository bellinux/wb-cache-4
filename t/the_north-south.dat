5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> Arterial—through downtown Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would connect with <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> Arterial.|$|E

Although passenger and commercial {{traffic on the}} Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, {{construction}} {{began on}} the east–west expressway in 1991 under a 50/50 cost-sharing agreement while the City of Hamilton attempted to sue the provincial government for the reinstatement of funding for <b>the</b> <b>north–south</b> portion. In April 1992, work began on overpasses at Upper Paradise Road and Upper Sherman Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Roman {{administrative}} and military presence is plentiful, and {{the junction of}} the east–west Incense Road to Gaza and <b>the</b> <b>north–south</b> route to the Red Sea probably made it an economically valuable frontier outpost.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{election}} of the NDP government in September 1990 — with representatives whom were all vocally opposed to the expressway since the late 1970s winning all six Hamilton-area seats — provincial funding was pulled from <b>the</b> <b>north–south</b> portion of the project in December.|$|E

5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The fault is connected to <b>the</b> <b>north–south</b> trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E

Although Fisher's 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines. The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking <b>the</b> <b>north-south</b> road there.|$|E

US12 {{at the corner of}} Front and Main streets. At the time it was decommissioned, Bus. US31 was only designated along <b>the</b> <b>north–south</b> segment between Walton Road and Main Street.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, New York state {{planners}} {{envisioned a}} system of arterial roads in Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81. Due to community opposition, only parts of the highway project were completed, including <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> Arterial Highway running west of the city. Six New York State highways, one three-digit interstate highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. New York State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city. New York State Route 5 and its alternate routes—State Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary highway of Interstate 90), New York State Route 12 and State Route 8 form <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> Arterial Highway.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, {{the course of the}} river was to be changed from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> connection, was only finished in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{plans were}} made to cover the Senne along its entire course within the greater Brussels area, which had grown {{significantly}} since the covering of the 19th century. The course of the Senne was changed to the downtown's peripheral boulevards. In 1976, the disused tunnels were converted into <b>the</b> <b>north-south</b> axis of Brussels' underground tram system, the premetro. Actual purification of the waste water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until March 2007, when two treatment stations were built, thus finally cleansing the Senne after centuries of problems.|$|E

5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live farther from the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While <b>the</b> <b>north-south</b> gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route8 (NY8) is a north-south {{state highway}} {{in the central}} part of New York in the United States. It runs in a southwest-to-northeast {{direction}} from the Southern Tier to the northern part of Lake George. The southern terminus of the route is at NY10 in the town of Deposit. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY9N in the town of Hague. Roughly midway between the two endpoints, NY8 passes through Utica, where it overlaps NY5, NY12, and Interstate790 (I-790) along one segment of <b>the</b> <b>North–South</b> Arterial.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine <b>the</b> <b>North-South</b> balance in Congress.|$|E
