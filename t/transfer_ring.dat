However, their maximum attainable load {{is limited by}} the occurrence of a ringing combustion. At high loads, the fast combustion rate gives rise to pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber accompanied by a ringing or knocking sound. In this work, it is investigated how these pressure oscillations affect the in-cylinder heat transfer and what the best approach is to model the heat <b>transfer</b> during <b>ringing</b> combustion. The heat transfer is measured with a thermopile heat flux sensor inside a CFR engine converted to HCCI operation. A variation of the mass fuel rate at different compression ratios is performed to measure the heat transfer during three different operating conditions: no, light and severe ringing. The occurrence of ringing increases both the peak heat flux and the total heat loss. This effect should be accounted for in the heat transfer models by increasing the convection coefficient. It is shown that the heat transfer correlations of Annand and Woschni are not able to accurately model the heat <b>transfer</b> during <b>ringing</b> combustion.

40|$|Ubiquitylation is a {{universal}} mechanism for controlling cellular functions. A large family of ubiquitin E 3 ligases (E 3) mediates Ubiquitin (Ub) modification. To facilitate Ub <b>transfer,</b> <b>RING</b> E 3 ligases bind both the substrate and ubiquitin E 2 conjugating enzyme (E 2) linked to Ub via a thioester bond to form a catalytic complex. The mechanism of Ub transfer catalyzed by RING E 3 remains elusive. By employing a combined computational approach including molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we characterized this catalytic mechanism in detail. The three-dimensional model of dimeric RING E 3 ligase RNF 4 RING, E 2 ligase UbcH 5 A, Ub and the substrate SUMO 2 shows close contact between the substrate and Ub transfer catalytic center. Deprotonation of the substrate lysine by D 117 on UbcH 5 A occurs with almost no energy barrier as calculated by MD and QM/MM calculations. Then, the side chain of the activated lysine gets close to the thioester bond via a conformation change. The Ub transfer pathway begins with a nucleophilic addition that forms an oxyanion intermediate of a 4. 23 kcal/mol energy barrier followed by nucleophilic elimination, resulting in a Ub modified substrate by a 5. 65 kcal/mol energy barrier.

40|$|Ring {{opening of}} tetraaryl thiirane cation radical was studied. The cation radical of tetraaryl thiirane {{generated}} photochemically undergoes C-C bond cleavage driven by inherent ring strain. This ring cleavage {{occurs in a}} stereospecific conrotatory manner at low temperature. However, this stereospecificity is lost when the reaction is conducted at room temperature. In this photoreaction between tetraaryl thiirane and tetracyanoethylene, (3 + 2) cycloadducts are obtained {{as a result of}} electron <b>transfer,</b> <b>ring</b> opening, back electron transfer, and 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. A CIDNP experiment and γ-irradiation of 2, 2 -di-p-anisyl- 3, 3 -diphenylthiirane were conducted to obtain more information about this reaction. Isomeric thiirane S-oxides were prepared to assign the structures of cis- and trans- 2, 3 -di-p-anisyl- 2, 3 -diphenylthiirane used in the stereochemical study of the ring opening reaction.

Tetraaryl thiirane cation radical generated by anodic oxidation underwent C-S bond cleavage rather than C-C bond cleavage which resulted in production of the corresponding olefin. Further oxidation of this olefin under air produces two ketones resulting from C=C bond cleavage.

Z- 4, 5 -Diethynyl- 4 -octene (4) undergoes rearrangement to yield 2, 3 -di-n-propyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene (17). Solution pyrolysis of 4 in inert aromatic solvents produces three unimolecular products, Z-dodeca- 4, 8 -diyn- 6 -ene (7), benzocyclooctene (9) and o-allyl-n-propylbenzene (10) in high yield. When 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene {{is added to the}} pyrolysis solution as a trapping agent, high yields of the reduced product o-di-n-propylbenzene (12) are obtained. The kinetics of solution pyrolysis of 4 in the presence and absence of trapping agent establish that 2, 3 -di-n-propyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene is a discrete intermediate on the pathway leading to products. When the reaction was run in the heated probe of an NMR spectrometer, CIDNP was observed in 10. This observation, along with kinetic and chemical trapping evidence, indicates the presence of two additional intermediates, formed from 17 by sequential intramolecular [1, 5] hydrogen transfer, on the pathway to products. The observation of CIDNP, coupled with the reactivity exhibited by 17 and the other two intermediates, implicate a biradical description of these molecules. Biradical 17 has been estimated to have a lifetime of about 10 {sup - 9 } sec at: 200 °C and to lie in a well of kcal/mol with respect to the lowest energy unimolecular pathway ([1, 5] hydrogen <b>transfer).</b> <b>Ring</b> opening (expected to be the lowest energy process for 1, 4 -dehydrobenzenes in which intramolecular hydrogen transfer is unlikely) to the isomeric diethynyl olefin 7 appears to have an activation enthalpy of about 10 kcal/moL Upon thermal reaction in the gas phase (400 °C) or in solution in inert solvents Z-hexa- 2, 3 -diethyl- 1, 5 -~diyn- 3 -ene (5) rearranges in good yield to the isomeric diethynyl olefin Z-deca- 3, 7 -diyn- 5 -ene (8) again presumably via 2, 3 -diethyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene 20 (addition of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene to the reaction solution leads to a good yield of o-diethylbenzene, the expected trapping product of biradical 20).

One of the main challenges is to create complex nanostructures other than closed-packed nanodots or nanoholes with hexagonal symmetry, or parallel nanolines based on block copolymer lithography. In this thesis, we demonstrate two approaches to generate novel structures such as ellipsoids, rings or square array of dots: diblock copolymers templating and triblock terpolymers. Without templating, diblock copolymer can only form spheres, cylinders, or lamellae typically. Triblock terpolymers, on the other hand, can form {{a larger number of}} morphologies even without using any template. The use of triblock terpolymers allows the formation of more complex pattern geometries compared to their diblock counterparts. Moreover, since most features in this thesis are made from an organometallic block, they have a high etch contrast and etch resistance compared to triblock terpolymers in which all three blocks contains organic segments, making them useful for pattern <b>transfer.</b> <b>Rings</b> are useful in the magnetic applications, quantum devices, and biosensors. Square symmetry array, which is not found in diblock copolymers, has applications in via formation, magnetic patterned media, and other applications. Besides, we examine the magnetic behavior of the antidot arrays of Co and pseudo-spin-valve structures with periodicity of 26 nm and 40 nm. (cont.) As the inter-hole spacing is decreased, both experiment and simulation results show that the coercivity and switching field distribution is reduced, unlike the behavior seen in films with micron- sized holes. In the multilayer, unlike the continuous film, the NiFe reverses at positive fields due to the strong magnetostatic interactions between the Co and NiFe layers present near the holes.
