25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court {{is not in a}} good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of preferential trade agreements has been significant since {{the establishment of}} the WTO. These agreements and regional integration schemes provide for rights and obligations that are often identical to those agreed upon in the WTO. Preferential trade agreements also provide for their own dispute settlement mechanism. Due to the parallelism of rights and obligations, trade disputes between members can often be settled under both the WTO dispute settlement mechanism as well as under the dispute settlement mechanism established by the preferential trade agreement. This overlap of jurisdictions may cause parallel or subsequent litigation concerning the same dispute. Members have attempted to solve this issue by including jurisdiction clauses in preferential trade agreements, which prohibit parties to the preferential agreement from initiating the WTO dispute settlement under certain conditions. This thesis examines whether the jurisdiction of a preferential trade agreement can override the jurisdiction of the WTO, and whether the WTO tribunals have the powers <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> exercise <b>jurisdiction</b> {{on the basis of the}} jurisdiction of a preferential trade agreement. I will examine what effects such jurisdiction clauses included in preferential trade agreements could be considered to have on the jurisdiction of the WTO, and other possible ways to solve jurisdictional conflicts. This thesis argues that it is indeed possible for WTO panels <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> exercise <b>jurisdiction</b> based on the jurisdiction of a tribunal established under a preferential trade agreement. To make this point, alternative solutions to overcome the conflicts are examined. The topic is divided into three main sections. These overlaps are first examined as a normative issue, concentrating on jurisdictional clauses and their potential effects. In this section the overall hierarchy of the two systems and the question of applicable law in the WTO dispute settlement system are studied. The question in this section is, can a PTA jurisdiction clause modify WTO member’s rights and obligations arising from the covered agreements. The second part concentrates on the procedural aspects of the overlaps. Here the focus is on rules of general international law established to govern the procedural issues in international adjudication. The question here is whether a parallel proceeding can by itself prevent WTO litigation. The third part focuses on the powers of the WTO tribunals and their abilities <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> exercise <b>jurisdiction.</b> In this part the relevant WTO case law regarding this issue is also studied more carefully. The last part of this paper gives a brief outlook of the issue from a policy perspective while also addressing the challenges the situation causes to the whole system...|$|R

5000|$|The {{question}} is what constitutes the [...] "same cause". In Gubisch Maschinenfabrik v Palumbo (1987) (Hartley: 1988) and The Tatry v The Maciej Rataj (1994), the test is whether the factual basis of the claim and the laws to be applied are the same {{with a view to}} obtaining the same basic outcome. The test cannot be formal. It must look to the substance of each claim so that technical or procedural differences cannot be used to justify invoking separate jurisdictions in different Member States. One difficulty has been in rem jurisdiction, e.g. as in shipping law, but the substance test looks behind the res and identifies who the parties are and identifies what their purpose or objects are in the litigation. The parties must also be the same although the roles may be reversed between plaintiff/claimant and defendant (Seatzu: 1999). However, in multi-party actions, the subsequent court is only obliged <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between the same parties, i.e. new parties may intervene and be heard in subsequent proceedings. But the courts are careful to look at the substance of the relationship between each set of parties. Thus, because an insurer has the right to use subrogation, the insurer and the insured would be considered the same person since they are both interested in achieving the same outcome. Similarly, a wholly owned subsidiary company can be regarded as the same party as its parent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the application}} of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to disputes arising between telecommunications undertakings under the EU Telecommunications Package, as revised on November 4, 2009. The new rules aimed at facilitating {{the development of the}} EU common telecommunications market, and were designed to increase the powers of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) across the Member States in the imposition of regulatory obligations in a coherent manner. One key reform concerned the centralisation of the dispute resolution functions of NRAs. Within the new dispute resolution prerogatives, NRAs were empowered with a right to determine their appropriateness for handling regulatory disputes between telecommunications undertakings or <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> their <b>jurisdiction</b> should other ADR means be available and more suitable for the resolution of regulatory disputes. This paper examines the mere development of ADR in telecommunications disputes in the UK, Ireland and Poland following the revision of the EU Telecommunications Package.

Furthermore, when the courts are attentive to the distinction between the jurisdictional and prudential bases for justiciability decisions, {{they are more likely to}} carefully evaluate the policy implications of those determinations.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the possibility and the restrictions on prorogation of jurisdiction and electio legis about bond loans issued by Italian companies, aimed at istitutional investors operating in Europe. The bond loan, in the part where it regulates relations between bondholders and the Company – and hence, as regards the quorum and the roles assigned to bondholders’ meeting by art. 2415 c. c. - is governed by lex societatis. This {{is not the case}} for the common representative of the bondholders: his election, in fact, is not mandatory. However, the powers and functions granted and assigned to it by law, not olny do correspond to the interest of the bondholders but also to those of the Company. Therefore, if a representative of bondholders is appointed, he will be subject to the lex societatis: he will assume the tasks and the powers indicated by italian law, regardless of the governing law chosen by the parties. With regard to the questions concerning the validity of the decisions of the bondholders’ meeting and the powers and the duties conferred upon them the prorogation of jurisdiction and the derogation from italian law are unlawful. The English court seised has <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> because the matter is reserved to the italian exclusive jurisdiction and law.

40|$|The Tax Injunction Act forbids {{federal courts}} from {{interfering with the}} “assessment, levy, or collection” of a state tax {{as long as a}} “plain, speedy, and {{efficient}} remedy” is available in state court. Effectively, this prevents federal courts from hearing challenges to state taxes based on constitutional grounds. Prior to and after the enactment of the Tax Injunction Act, federal courts used the principle of comity <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over lawsuits that challenged state taxes, even if the Tax Injunction Act itself would not forbid such a lawsuit. In a 2004 decision, Hibbs v. Winn, the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the Tax Injunction Act, holding that the Act applied only to claims which would disrupt the flow of state tax revenue. Afterwards, a circuit split arose regarding the scope of the Hibbs decision. Some courts believed that the decision restricted the both Tax Injunction Act and the comity doctrine; the Fourth Circuit held that only the Tax Injunction Act was affected. The Supreme Court resolved the split in a 2010 decision, Commerce Energy, Inc. v. Levin. There, the Court held that Hibbs only applied to lawsuits challenging a state tax benefit enjoyed by a third party, and therefore comity precluded federal courts from hearing the lawsuit. The Court declined to address whether the Tax Injunction Act applied to Commerce Energy. Given the history of the comity doctrine, the Court incorrectly applied the doctrine in Hibbs, and in Commerce Energy did not go far enough in limiting the holding of Hibbs. The Court also incorrectly applied Sinochem International Co. v. Malaysia International Shipping Corp. when it declined to address whether the Tax Injunction Act applied to Commerce Energy.

40|$|Territorial {{authority}} to adjudicate is the preeminent component of private international law. Empirical research proves that forum really affects outcome, probably by multiple influences. This practical effect makes international harmonization of jurisdictional law highly desirable. Although harmonization of nonjurisdictional law remains quite unlikely, jurisdictional harmonization is increasingly feasible because, among other reasons, U. S. jurisdictional law in fact exhibits no essential differences from European law. None {{of the usual}} assertions holds up as an unbridgeable difference, including that (1) the peculiar U. S. jurisdictional law flows inevitably from a different theory of governmental authority, one that rests on power notions; (2) U. S. law differs because its legal institutions have managed to constitutionalize jurisdiction; (3) {{it is the same}} old story of common-law courts playing too active a part {{in the development of the}} law in the United States; (4) the United States has resolved the fundamental jurisprudential tension between certainty and precision in a way that maximizes the role of fact-specific inquiry; and (5) those activist courts are ironically too willing <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> bestowed on them by the legislature. Indeed, with minor legislative reforms to give the U. S. law somewhat greater certainty and restraint, the distance to Europe would shrink even further. Jurisdiction could thus be the fulcrum for rearranging the international judicial order.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the traditional}} notion of jurisdiction {{in the light}} of Internet based activities which are inherently decentralised and ubiquitous. It is clear that the unique nature of the Internet has undermined the very foundation of the traditional notion of jurisdiction and the territorially based concepts of law and their application. Which court should hear disputes arising out of Internet activities? On what grounds may a court assert or decline the jurisdiction? These are perplexing questions currently facing courts worldwide because of the trans-national nature of the Internet by which people can transcend borders readily and rapidly. One simple and straightforward factor confronting lawmakers is that while most laws have a territorial nexus, the Internet defies the notion of territoriality. Traditionally, judicial jurisdiction has been exercised on a number of bases, such as where the defendant resides, whether the defendant is present within the forum and whether the defendant has property in the forum or not. These elements have been made largely irrelevant by the Internet. The Internet does not respect traditional boundaries and territories and it can even enable people to cross borders without any physical mobility. For instance, people are able to interact and even do business without revealing their identity. In the absence of any definite international law on Internet jurisdiction, how have the courts responded to this challenge? This thesis has examined the recent case law in Australia, United States of America and France. In examining the case authorities, the only conclusion that can be reached is that current court approaches are unworkable. This thesis has also examined some international proposals on the matter and found them to be deficient. Now, the dilemma before us is this: on the one hand, the present court approaches on Internet jurisdiction are unworkable. On the other hand, there is no clear international guidance to govern the jurisdictional issue. I believe this book makes a small contribution towards this perplexing question by proposing a new transnational principle which could be achieved through a "trans-national judicial dialogue". Trans-national judicial dialogue can {{play a significant role in}} the creation, recognition, and enforcement of global norms. There are a number of benefits to be gained if this approach is adopted in Internet jurisdiction cases. Ideally, trans-national judicial dialogue would reduce the conflicts among courts and foster a consensual approach, thus providing a stable and predictable paradigm for the crucial issue of jurisdiction. Moreover, the parties involved in a case would be prevented from forum shopping in search of a forum with a greater likelihood of a favourable decision. Also, courts would not be able <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> merely because of foreign elements involved. This may be the most appropriate global approach which is urgently required to address an increasingly global problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the problem of {{parallel}} proceedings, the research starts, in Chapter 1, with a description of the taxonomy of parallel proceedings (Paragraph 1. 1) and with an analysis of the most likely reasons behind the growth of this phenomenon (Paragraph 1. 2). Chapter 1 deeply analyses the already mentioned policy considerations at the basis of the research (Paragraph 1. 3). The following structure of the research follows the temporal sequence of the various phases of arbitration where the problem may emerge, namely jurisdiction, admissibility and post-award. The analysis starts – at Chapter 2 – by examining the jurisdictional stage, where, as it is demonstrated, there are no solutions to the problem of parallel proceedings. Indeed, this phase is based on the grundnorm of consent and there are no available legal tools that allow arbitrators <b>to</b> <b>decline</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> disregarding party autonomy (Paragraph 2. 1). Similarly, remedies based on a sole exercise of discretion (such as comity) are not reliable in order to find a predictable {{solution to the problem of}} parallel proceedings (Paragraph 2. 2). The research then moves to the analysis of the remedies available at the stage of admissibility. This methodologically imposes to preliminary deal with several other questions, such as the legal foundation of the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility (Paragraph 3. 1), the analysis of the inherent powers (if any) of arbitrators to safeguard the interests of justice while administering their proceedings, and the law applicable in international investment arbitration (with a particular focus on the applicability of general principles of international law) (Paragraph 3. 2). We first of all demonstrate that international law provides us with some instruments in order to avoid parallel proceedings (not including lis pendens, as demonstrated in Paragraph 3. 3), namely the principles of good faith and finality (Paragraph 3. 4). These principles respectively furnish the grounds for the doctrine of abuse of process, on the one side, and res judicata and collateral estoppel, on the other side. It is then necessary to understand how and whether these tools may be applied in investment arbitration (Paragraphs 3. 5, 3. 6 and 3. 7). This requires, firstly, an analysis of these doctrines in international law and, secondly, a comparative analysis of how they have been applied in different municipal systems (with a particular focus on the distinction between civil law and common law systems). It finally emerges that such doctrines have been applied also in a flexible and substance-oriented way, which would be very helpful in order to limit parallel proceedings. This approach is, indeed, highly desirable. Chapter 3 also demonstrates how these doctrines may operate in concrete (Paragraph 3. 8) and put forward a proposal of amendment of rules of international arbitration in order to limit parallel proceedings and, at the same time, ensure the respect of due process (Paragraph 3. 9). Finally, remedies available at post-award stage will be examined in Chapter 4. These remedies are different with regard to ICSID awards – being ICSID a self-contained regime – and with regard to non-ICSID awards, which shall be enforced according to the provisions of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. In the former case, we try to understand whether the remedy of annulment provided by the ICSID Convention may be useful in order to avoid the existence of two duplicative awards (Paragraph 4. 1). In the latter case the only available means to preclude the enforcement of a duplicative award is the public policy exception set forth in Art. V(2) (b) of the New York Convention. The analysis of the public policy exception involves several difficulties due to the involvement of municipal laws and courts and will require an examination of the national rules of private international law regulating the problem of conflicting judgments (Paragraph 4. 2). Finally, Paragraph 4. 3 tries to understand whether the existence of duplicative awards may be a ground for annulment at the place of the seat of arbitration...|$|E
