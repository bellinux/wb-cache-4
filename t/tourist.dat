5|$|Great Northern Highway {{travels to}} remote areas of Western Australia, {{including}} the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges, and {{the communities of}} Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres {{in the north of}} the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} road's traffic, and is a growing part of or potential growth source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of <b>tourist</b> attractions, including New Norcia, the Yilgarn area, and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the <b>tourist</b> routes Swan Valley <b>Tourist</b> Drive (<b>Tourist</b> Drive203) in Perth, Chittering Valley <b>Tourist</b> Way (<b>Tourist</b> Drive359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands <b>Tourist</b> Way (<b>Tourist</b> Drive360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie–Windjana <b>Tourist</b> Way (<b>Tourist</b> Drive350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing.|$|E

40|$|Actions {{regarding}} {{environmental conservation}} are regulated by law {{and there are}} many cases in which <b>tourists</b> are forced to conform to it.

In this study, I analyzed the actions in the Republic of Korea to consider laws aiming for environmental conservation in the country, the present conditions of action done by a <b>tourist's</b> institution based on the laws, and the understanding of <b>tourists.</b> As a result, it was indicated that overseas <b>tourists</b> were not informed of these actions. Therefore it became clear that <b>tourists</b> were forced to conform to the laws without being given any opportunity to understand these actions in advance. It is apparent that <b>tourists</b> become dissatisfied with inconvenience without knowing any sound reasons to follow the regulations. However, it is possible that <b>tourists</b> can understand the actions if they are informed of sound reasons concerning environmental conservation. At the same time, it is expected that <b>tourists</b> will {{be able to have a}} lot of meaningful experience through understanding the environmental actions.

By comparing the responses of <b>tourists</b> with those in the service sector, this study identified future tasks for inbound tourism. This study focused on <b>tourists</b> from Hong Kong and Taiwan. In a parallel questionnaire, employees of restaurants in Kanazawa City were interviewed. The results of the survey on <b>tourists</b> from Hong Kong and Taiwan were compared with the results from non-Asian <b>tourists.</b> A significant difference was observed as regards the communication between <b>tourists</b> and staff (i. e., the language barrier) between the two groups.

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a <b>tourist</b> developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional <b>tourist</b> attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated <b>tourist</b> attractions closed their doors to tourists.
