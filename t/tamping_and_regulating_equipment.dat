Development and {{investigation}} of a dynamic model of electric drive {{on the base of}} the rolling rotor motor (RRM) which reflects the positioning of the actuator of the locking <b>and</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>equipment</b> in time. Methodology. Analytical description of electromagnetic and mechanical processes in the electric drive during the RRM shaft movement by using a system of differential equations. Numerical imitation modeling with the processes visualization in the Matlab environment of the RRM rotor displacement with mechanical load in time. Results. It is shown that the degree of influence {{of the value of the}} load inertia on the dynamics of the object obtained by the waveform changes the rotation angle of the rotor and motor speed in time. The degree of influence of the value of the electromagnetic time constant of the dynamics of the positioning of the actuator, and the nature of transients during acceleration and fixing position of the rotor with a predetermined moment of inertia for different values of inductance. The effect of the ratio of electromechanical and electromagnetic time constants of the nature of the transition processes accompanying jog mode angular displacement of the drive shaft on the base of RRM. Originality. The lack of technical means to ensure acceptable accuracy time measurement of angular displacement shaft of the actuator in jog mode offset by using a laser meter which gives the opportunity to assess the adequacy of the dynamic model of the RRM. Practical value. The results of investigations allow to create a tool for optimization of structural, technical and hardware and software solutions for the improvement and modernization of the projected electric locking <b>and</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>equipment.</b> The direction for improving the dynamics of the drive on the basis of RRM is indicated providing for an increase in its torque characteristics of the motor by reducing the influence of the parameters of transients...|$|R

A DI&M program begins with a baseline survey to identify and quantify leaks. Repairs that are cost-effective to fix are then made to the leaking components. Subsequent surveys are {{based on data from}} previous surveys, allowing operators to concentrate on the components that are most likely to leak and are profitable to repair.

[...] In 1920, the County of London Electric Supply Company applied for permission to build a power station at Creekmouth in Barking capable of expansion to 600 MW. The Barking A Station had 8 C. A. Parsons turbo-generators (4 x 40 MW and 4 X 20 MW) and 22 boilers, plus 2 dedicated reheat boilers. These were in two boiler houses, one being all chain grate boilers (6 B&W and 6 Yarrow) and the other being all pulverised fuel boilers (I.C.L.). Barking Power Station opened in 1925, and in 1927 it took over from the Barking Town Urban District Council station, providing a bulk electricity supply.When completed, the A station was the largest power station in Britain to have been built as a complete station at one time.

40|$|Equipment leak {{standards}} {{are designed to}} control emissions of VOCs <b>and</b> VHAPs from <b>regulated</b> <b>equipment</b> {{through the application of}} work practices and equipment practices. The work practice most commonly applied to control equipment leaks is the LDAR program, which is discussed in detail in Section 2. 2. 4. 2. Subsequent chapters address the monitoring, recordkeeping. and reporting requirements of implementing a LDAR program under NSPS or NESHAP standards. In this chapter, <b>regulated</b> <b>equipment</b> is reviewed to illustrate how monitoring programs are applied to specific pieces of equipment action, and special canned-motor and diaphragm pumps (US. �PA, 1990). Chemicals transferred by pumps can leak at the point of contact between the moving shaft and stationary casing. To isolate the pump's interior from the atmosphere. all pumps, except the seal-less type (canned-motor and diaphragm), require a seal {{at the point where the}} shaft penetrates the housing. The most commonly used seals in these pumps are packed and mechanical (US. EPA. 1980 a). Equipment practices include the use of specific types of components, equipment design standards or specifications, and operational standards for certain types of equipment. Equipment practices are evaluated using performance standards that provide a basis for monitoring or substantiating the effectiveness of such control practices. Equipment practices, briefty summarized in Section 2. 2. 4. 3, are addressed in greater detail in this chapter. A general set of equipment is covered by all of the equipment leak standards. Some equipment is covered only by specific standards. For example, product accumulator vessels are covered only by the equipment leak standards for benzene. Also, the vinyl chloride fugitive emission standards cover additional sources (loading and unloading lines, agitators, slip gauges, opening of equipment. and inprocess wastewater). Except for agitaton, however, the emissions from these sources generally are not considered "equipment leaks. " The equipment leak standards also identify requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices that may be used to comply with the regulations...|$|R

5000|$|Early {{machines}} only {{lifted the}} track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or <b>tamping</b> <b>and</b> lining machine, also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel and level, {{in order to achieve}} a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the track to sag. The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. [...] "Lining" [...] rails doesn't involve ballast tamping, it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining <b>tamping</b> <b>and</b> lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.|$|R
