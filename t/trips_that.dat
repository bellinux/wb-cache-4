5|$|Rambles in Germany and Italy, in 1840, 1842, and 1843 is {{a travel}} {{narrative}} by the British Romantic author Mary Shelley. Issued in 1844, {{it is her}} last published work. Published in two volumes, the text describes two European <b>trips</b> <b>that</b> Mary Shelley took with her son, Percy Florence Shelley, {{and several of his}} university friends. Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, between 1818 and 1823. For her, Italy was associated with both joy and grief: she had written much while there but she had also lost her husband and two of her children. Thus, although she was anxious to return, the trip was tinged with sorrow. Shelley describes her journey as a pilgrimage, which will help cure her depression.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these <b>trips</b> <b>that</b> Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E

25|$|The work to {{establish}} a charter division {{began in the early}} 1980s, when the company realized that it had a large amount of idle capacity during the daytime, in the evenings and in the weekends. A concession was granted in 1983 and the first trip was from Follafoss to Meråker for two days. In 1984, eight trips were offered, and six were made.Sales were done through Bennett Reisebureau and NSB Reisebyrå. By 1986, the division had a revenue of NOK4 million. By 1994, it had reached 17million and offered 92 <b>trips.</b> <b>That</b> year, the division was rebranded TrønderReiser. TrønderReiser was in 1997 sold to some of the employees. In 1999, it was taken over by Sende Busstrafikk, but the company was not making money and filed for bankruptcy in December 2000.|$|E
25|$|As the {{collection}} {{point for the}} majority of South Africa's water, the Orange River {{plays a major role in}} supporting agriculture, industry and mining. To assist in this, two large water schemes have been created, the Orange River Project and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Historically, the river played an important role in the South African diamond rush, with the first diamonds in the country being discovered in alluvial deposits on the Orange. Today, several commercial diamond mines operate along the final stretch of the Orange River and around its mouth. Finally, because of the lack of dangerous animals and high water levels during summer, the river is used for recreational canoeing and rafting. Orange River Rafting has become very popular with many companies using their camps along the river to operate from. The most popular trips are a 4-day and a 6-day river <b>trips</b> <b>that</b> take place either along the gorge below the Augrabies Falls or along the Richtersveld area.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 2011, {{medallion}} prices dropped considerably likely due {{to competition}} from ride-share services. , medallion prices had dropped to around $500,000 in value, with one medallion dropping to $250,000. There was also a decrease in taxi usage: in November 2016, there were 336,737 daily <b>trips</b> <b>that</b> netted $4.98 million, a decrease from the 463,701 daily trips netting $5.17 million in November 2010. However, in mid-2016, after a five-year decline, taxi usage began to increase again. Due to this competition, medallion owners sued the city and Uber in November 2015. By 2017, the 60,000 ride share vehicles in New York City outnumbered the city's medallion vehicles {{at a ratio of}} almost 4 to 1, and many medallion owners faced the prospect of bankruptcy or severe debt because of the low medallion prices, which few entities were willing to buy. Medallion holders had trouble making payments on the loans that they borrowed to pay for the medallions.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{a number}} of {{traditional}} docked public bike systems operated by local municipal governments opened across China, with the largest ones being in Wuhan and Hangzhou. In 2017, {{a number of}} private competing app-based dockless bike-sharing programs have started to appear in numerous cities across China. The two largest of the dockless operators are Mobike and Ofo, others include Bluegogo and Xiaoming. Many Chinese cities have experienced massive {{growth in the number}} and use these dockless bikeshare programs, clogging sidewalks around major commercial hubs and subway stations with parked bikes. Given the speed of growth with these services, local governments did not have any regulations or planning to accommodate these systems. However the Chinese government encourages the development of dock less bikes to reduce urban pollution. Early studies in Beijing and Shanghai have linked the massive increase of dockless bike shares to the {{decrease in the number of}} private automobile <b>trips</b> <b>that</b> are less than five kilometres. In Guangzhou, the arrival of dockless bike shares had a positive impact in the growth of cycling modeshare. The Transport Commission of Shenzhen noted a 10% decrease in private car trips after the introduction of dockless bike shares.|$|E
