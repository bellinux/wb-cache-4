5|$|In 1750 as {{a result}} of the Treaty of Madrid seven {{missions}} in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native Guaraní tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the Guarani War.

In 1758, the Jesuits were accused of a conspiracy to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair.
