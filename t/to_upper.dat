5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tucumán, Tristán garrisoned {{at the city}} of Salta with 2,500 men. Belgrano, with {{reinforcements}} from the government, intended to gather 4,000 men and march <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru, up to {{the border of the}} Viceroyalty of Lima. The Battle of Salta, the first battle with the new approved banner, was a decisive victory, ending with the capitulation of Pío Tristán and all of his army.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which {{made it difficult for}} him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E

5|$|In April 1811 the Portsea Island Company {{constructed}} the first {{piped water supply}} <b>to</b> <b>upper</b> and middle class houses. It supplied water to approximately 4500 of the 14,000 houses, generating an income £5000 a year. HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|E

5|$|The B, D, and Q trains {{were all}} rerouted from the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line to the express tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line {{as part of}} Manhattan Bridge reconstruction. No more express service was to be run on the Broadway Line, since these {{services}} comprised the entirety of Broadway express service. This also eliminated the divided B and D services (the Sixth Avenue Line B/D services were separate from the Broadway Line B/D services, as the Sixth Avenue services had originated at 34th Street–Herald Square and continued <b>to</b> <b>upper</b> Manhattan and the Bronx via the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the IND Concourse Line).|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} realignment that occurred {{at this time}} was in the North Country, where NY3 was shifted onto its current alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh.

Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake, the routing of NY3 was previously unnumbered, as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake.|$|E

5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{production of}} its new airliner, Boeing doubled {{the size of the}} Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5billion to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access <b>to</b> <b>upper</b> body sections. Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993. By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines. Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2billion from suppliers.|$|E

5|$|Upper {{secondary}} education or framhaldsskóli (lit. “continued school”), follows lower {{secondary education}}. These schools are {{also known as}} gymnasia in English. It is not compulsory, but everyone who has had their compulsory education has the right <b>to</b> <b>upper</b> secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 2007. Like all other schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools are mixed sex.|$|E
5|$|When Belgrano was {{dispatched}} <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru, María Josefa {{followed him}} to Jujuy. She {{took part in the}} Jujuy Exodus and saw the battle of Tucumán.

Pedro Pablo was adopted by Encarnación Ezcurra and her husband, Juan Manuel de Rosas, who she had married shortly before.|$|E

He {{remained}} {{at the site of}} his victory for five days, before returning to Balkh, nine days after his departure. From there he set out for Jazza, where the khagan had fled. Suluk fled before the Arab pursuit, but the Arabs were soon beset by heavy rain and snow, allowing the khagan and Ibn Surayj to escape <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Tokharistan, whence they moved on to Usrushana.

5|$|Castelli was {{not well}} {{received}} in Córdoba, where Liniers was popular, {{but he was in}} San Miguel de Tucumán. In Salta, despite a formal good reception, he had difficulty obtaining troops, mules, food, money, or guns. He took political leadership of the expedition <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru, displacing Hipólito Vieytes, and replaced Ocampo with Colonel Antonio González Balcarce. He was informed that Cochabamba revolted in support of the Junta, but was threatened by royalist forces from La Paz. Castelli intercepted a letter from Nieto to Gutiérrez de la Concha, governor of Córdoba, who was already executed for his support of Liniers. This letter mentioned a royalist army led by Goyeneche marching to Jujuy. Balcarce, who had advanced to Potosi, was defeated by Nieto in the Battle of Cotagaita, so Castelli sent two hundred men and two cannon to strengthen his forces. With these reinforcements, Balcarce achieved victory at the Battle of Suipacha, which allowed patriots to control all of Upper Peru unopposed. One of the men sent was Martín Miguel de Güemes, who would eventually lead the Guerra Gaucha in Salta years later.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly twenty years, before being returned by Charles Evans <b>to</b> <b>Upper</b> Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei <b>to</b> <b>upper</b> motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
