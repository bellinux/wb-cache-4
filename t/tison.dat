25|$|In March 1804, Cambrian {{was under}} the command of Captain William Bradley and on her way to Bermuda when she {{captured}} two French privateers. On 22 March she captured the schooner <b>Tison</b> after a chase of 25 hours. <b>Tison</b> had been armed with six 9 and 12-pounder guns, which she threw overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 59 men {{under the command of}} Joseph Kastique, and had been out of Guadaloupe for 11 days buy had not captured anything. Four days later Cambrian captured the schooner Alexander (or Alexandre), which was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 68 men under the command of Charles La Marque. She had been cruising for 11 days but had not taken anything. Head money was paid in June 1827.|$|E
25|$|The updated one-colour {{version of}} the gem/pizza logo, created by Hubert <b>Tison</b> and Robert Innes, was {{introduced}} on January 1, 1986, and with it was introduced {{a new series of}} computer graphic-generated television idents for CBC and Radio-Canada. These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo, accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC's new, orchestrated five-note jingle. The logo was changed to one colour, generally dark blue on white, or white on dark blue, in 1986. Print ads and most television promos, however, have always used a single-colour version of this logo since 1974.|$|E

[...] In Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out, author Sean Griffin observed that [...] "the more respectable parishioners pray for wealth, fame and glory." [...] According to Annalee R. Ward, author of Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film, [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] is a [...] "tender prayer-song" [...] in which [...] "Esmeralda expresses a heart full of concern for others, which ultimately Quasimodo mistakes as a heart for him." [...] Esmeralda is [...] "bathed in colored light from the stained glass window" [...] as [...] "God’s light shines down upon Esmeralda" [...] via a rose window. Initially, the song does not specify to whom the prayer is being recited – Mary, Jesus or God. It does, however, does suggest that both Mary and Jesus are former outcasts, much like Esmeralda herself. In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, author <b>Tison</b> Pugh described Esmeralda as [...] "latently or innately Christian." ...|$|E

500|$|Identified by Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog as [...] "the {{epitome of}} a ... control freak", Refinery29's Kelsey Miller {{summarized}} Monica's personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica {{is known for}} being a [...] "neat freak" [...] obsessed with cleanliness – {{especially when it comes}} to maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica's neuroses until the show's first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel, author Cheryl St. John wrote that Monica exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James <b>Tison</b> of Bustle wrote that Monica's cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being [...] "the lame one" [...] among her friends, although [...] "she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important". However, the Los Angeles Timess Steve Weinstein observed that Monica's actions often tend to contradict her [...] "Miss Perfect" [...] image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently [...] "makes a fool of herself" [...] in addition to being [...] "so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends' messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles." [...] Although several of Monica's personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as [...] "quirky and amusing" [...] as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Durham College's The Water Buffalo, Michelle Munro {{observed}} that the first five Disney Princesses share physical and personality traits, namely their white skin, naivety, kindness and compassion, [...] "show viewers what Disney believed a princess should look and act like" [...] at that time. Munro concluded that Aurora specifically can appear both spoiled and childish in demeanor at times. Bailey Cavender of The Silver Petticoat Review believes that the character's appearance and style {{is reminiscent of the}} Gibson Girl, a popular character created and designed by graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson, who embodied the idea that [...] "physical beauty was a measure of fitness, character, and Americanness". According to Cavender, Aurora's beauty was considered to be [...] "ideal" [...] for women at the time her film was released, embodying the [...] "classic standards of beauty." [...] In his book Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema, Douglas Brode agreed that Aurora is [...] "a model of modern (1950s) female glamour", comparing her long blonde hair to that of actress Brigitte Bardot while likening her gown to the work of fashion designer Christian Dior. According to The Dissolves Noel Murray, Aurora's story is a metaphor about a [...] "young woman being cautioned to avoid penetration." [...] Similarly, Carrie R. Wheadon, writing for Common Sense Media, interpreted Aurora's arousal by a handsome prince as being symbolic of a young woman's [...] "transition to adulthood and sexual awakening." [...] According to Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment author Douglas Brode, Aurora is [...] "torn between childlike loyalties and adult instincts", while The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past author <b>Tison</b> Pugh believes that Aurora's first encounter with Prince Phillip [...] "tips her from fantasy into reality, from childhood into womanhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Defending Flynn's personality, Levi {{explained}} that [...] "Deep down, Flynn {{has a good}} core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naiveté of Rapunzel." [...] The actor concluded that [...] "These are two very different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure." [...] According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn [...] "teaches [...] about courage". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a [...] "partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own." [...] Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as [...] "more humane". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn [...] "a charismatic bad boy", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' [...] (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that [...] "Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib {{in a way that}} many people now associate with DreamWorks." [...] On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character [...] "only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities". According to <b>Tison</b> Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn [...] "amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries [...] "most of the [...] modern humor". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's [...] "main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance".|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes that Monica serves as [...] "the solid center in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James <b>Tison</b> agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Butterfly" [...] logo was {{designed}} for the CBC by Hubert <b>Tison</b> in 1966 to mark the network's progressing transition from black-and-white to colour television, much {{in the manner of}} the NBC peacock logo. It was used at the beginning of programs broadcast in colour, and was used until all CBC television programs had switched to colour. A sketch on the CBC Television program Wayne & Shuster once referred to this as the logo of the [...] "Cosmic Butterfly Corporation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walton's first {{contention}} {{before the}} Court was that [...] "every {{finding of fact}} underlying the sentencing decision must be made by a jury, not by a judge, and that the Arizona scheme would be constitutional only if a jury decides what aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present in a given case and the trial judge then imposes the sentence based on those findings." [...] But the Court had consistently rejected {{the suggestion that the}} Constitution required jury sentencing. [...] Aggravating factors were not [...] "elements" [...] of the crime; as the Court had previously held, they were merely standards to guide the choice between a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment. [...] Moreover, the Constitution does allow a judge to make the findings required by Enmund v. Florida and <b>Tison</b> v. Arizona. [...] The Enmund/Tison finding is not a substantive limit on the definition of a crime, and neither were aggravating factors. [...] Accordingly, the Sixth Amendment did not require a jury to pass on aggravating factors.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1961–1962 season, {{with the}} {{probation}} {{no longer in}} place, Wooden had returned his team {{to the top of}} the conference. This time, however, they would take the next step, and in so doing, unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college basketball. UCLA reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. A narrow loss, due largely to a controversial foul call in a 1962 semi-final game against Ed Jucker's eventual national champion Cincinnati team, convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships. Two seasons later in 1964, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach Jerry Norman persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense, which increased the probability [...] of turnovers by the opposing team. The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team that went 30–0 on its way to the school's first basketball national championship and first undefeated season as the Bruins beat Vic Bubas' taller and slower Duke Blue Devils 98–83 in the final. Walt Hazzard fouled out of the game late in the second half on a player control foul, but this was irrelevant when he cut down the net in celebration and was named tournament most valuable player. Gail Goodrich, Keith Erickson, Fred Slaughter, and Jack Hirsch [...] contributed to the UCLA win. With no player taller than 6 feet, 5 inches, the Bruins' speed and zone press forced 29 turnovers and nullified the height advantage of Duke's Hack <b>Tison</b> and Jay Buckley, two 6-foot, 10-inch players.|$|E

Meanwhile, the other Tisons {{transferred}} their belongings into the Lyonses' car, keeping the Lyonses' money and guns. Gary <b>Tison</b> shot out the radiator on the Lincoln, and forced the Lyonses out. John Lyons began begging Gary <b>Tison</b> for his life; Gary <b>Tison</b> mentioned he was [...] "thinking about" [...] killing the Lyonses. Gary told Raymond and Ricky {{to go back to the}} Lyonses' car and get some water. According to Raymond, while they were gone, Gary started shooting the Lyonses; according to Ricky, the shooting began once they returned with the water.
