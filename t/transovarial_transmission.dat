25|$|Strains of Rickettsia rickettsii, {{the disease}} aften of Rocky Mountain spotted fever {{have been found}} in the rabbit tick. The rabbit tick transmits the {{bacteria}} through <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> to its host.

A Brazilian strain of the Rickettsia rickettsii was also found recently in Rio de Janeiro in ticks found on wild rabbits as well as rabbit ticks in Costa Rica. Since rabbit ticks support the infection of virulent strains of this bacteria, H. leporispalustris contains a role in the maintenance of R. rickettsii in the Americas. H. leporispalustris is currently one of the known vectors that is keeping this bacteria in circulation. Rabbit ticks prefer to not feed on humans so the transmission of this bacteria via rabbit ticks to humans is rare. Also, H. leporispalustris transmits Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis. Strains of Anaplasma bovis have also been found in rabbit ticks, which was discovered in a Nantucket tick study of the bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In {{animals and}} humans, microsporidia often cause chronic, {{debilitating}} diseases rather than lethal infections. Effects on the host include reduced longevity, fertility, weight, and general vigor. Vertical transmission of microsporidia is frequently reported.

However, the larval, nymphal and adult stages of A. cajennense were shown to be partially refractory to R. rickettsii infection, as in all cases, only part of the ticks became infected by this agent, after being exposed to rickettsemic animals. In addition, less than 50 % of the infected engorged females transmitted rickettsiae transovarially, and when they did so, only part of the offspring became infected, indicating that vertical transmission alone is not enough to maintain R. rickettsii in A. cajennense for multiple generations. Finally, the R. rickettsii-infected tick groups had lower reproductive performance than the uninfected control group. Our results indicate that A. cajennense have a low efficiency to maintain R. rickettsii for successive generations, as R. rickettsii-infection rates should decline drastically throughout the successive tick generations.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{consisted}} of two experiments that evaluated experimental infections of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris ticks by a Brazilian strain of Rickettsia rickettsii, and their effect on tick biology. In experiment I, ticks were exposed to R. rickettsii during the larval, nymphal or adult stages by feeding on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) needle-inoculated with R. rickettsii, and thereafter reared on uninfected rabbits for the entire next tick generation. Regardless of the tick stage that acquired the infection, all subsequent tick stages were shown to be infected by PCR (infection rates varying from 1. 3 to 41. 7 %), {{and were able to}} transmit R. rickettsii to uninfected rabbits, as demonstrated by rabbit seroconversion, guinea pig inoculation with rabbit blood, and PCR on rabbit blood. In Experiment II, ticks were exposed to R. rickettsii during the larval stage by feeding on rabbits co-infested with R. rickettsii-infected adult ticks, and thereafter reared on uninfected rabbits until the next generation of larvae. Again, all subsequent tick stages were shown to be infected by PCR (infection rates varying from 3. 0 to 40. 0 %), and were able to transmit R. rickettsii to uninfected rabbits. Thus, it was demonstrated that larvae, nymphs, and adults of H. leporispalustris were able to acquire and maintain the R. rickettsii infection by transstadial and <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmissions</b> within the tick population, with active transmission of the bacterium to susceptible rabbits by all parasitic stages. Analyses of biological parameters of uninfected and R. rickettsii-infected tick lineages were performed in order to evaluate possible deleterious effects of R. rickettsii to the infected tick lineages. Surprisingly, {{all but one of the}} four R. rickettsii-experimental groups of the present study showed overall better biological performance than their sibling uninfected control ticks. Results of the present study showed that H. leporispalustris could support infection by a high virulent strain of R. rickettsii for at least two generations, in which infected tick lineages tended to have better performance than uninfected ticks.

Without <b>transovarial</b> or venereal <b>transmission,</b> a vector-borne pathogen’s persistence in nature depends on successful passage between> 1 species of vertebrate reservoirs. For Lyme borreliosis in eastern North America, black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) larvae acquire Borrelia burgdorferi from a reservoir host {{during their first}} blood meal. Infection persists through subsequent molts, and when a tick feeds {{for the second time}} as a nymph it may transmit infection to another competent reservoir or to a human. Reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi are commonly white-footed mice but also include chipmunks, voles, shrews, and ground-foraging birds. When a tick-borne agent has multiple reservoir hosts, assigning relative contributions of each species to maintenance of the pathogen in the environment may be difficult. One approach is to capture animals, sample blood or tissue for evidence of infection, and examine embedded ticks for the microorganism (1, 2). However, this approach is laborand resource-intensive, and sample sizes are limited. Greater statistical power could be attained with fewer resources if questing ticks were examined not only for infection but also for the source of the last blood meal because the tick would likely have acquired the infection from that vertebrate.

40|$|West Nile Virus (WNV) is {{a member}} of the genus Flavivirus and is {{transmitted}} by mosquitoes. It first appeared in North America in New York City in 1999 and was first detected in Windsor Ontario in an infected bird collected in early August 2001. Prior to WNV, flaviviruses were not of major concern in Canada as only 1 short outbreak had occurred in the country. The secondary transmission cycles of WNV are typically overlooked in regards to their role in maintenance and survival of the virus in nature. The first component of this thesis was to investigate <b>transovarial</b> or transovum <b>transmission</b> (TOT) of WNV in Ontario during the 2012 and 2013 epidemic seasons. 89 males from 7 different traps were tested from samples collected in 2012. During the 2013 season individuals across 9 different WNV vector species were collected throughout the Niagara region with 1023 tested for the presence of naturally occurring WNV TOT. None of the samples showed signs of TOT. A single gravid female Culex pipiens tested positive for WNV, but no viral RNA was found in any of her 270 offspring, highlighting the many difficulties in detecting this type of transmission in natural populations. Laboratory testing was conducted to further investigate secondary transmission of WNV. A novel method for infecting adult mosquitoes was developed during this process; it was found more individuals would feed on an infectious sugar meal (ISM) as opposed to an infected blood meal in the lab setting. The ISM showed rates of infection, dissemination, and transmission by the WNV vector Aedes albopictus that were similar to those observed in previous vector competence studies. The ease of infecting adults and the similar rates of infection to previous literature suggests that this method could be used to investigate vector competence of other species for WNV. The ISM was also successful in the infection of male Aedes albopictus and was used to investigate WNV venereal transmission (VT) within the species. Evidence showed that 45 % of the uninfected virgin females were positive for WNV after mating with infected males, indicating for the first time that male Aedes albopictus could transmit the virus venereally...|$|R

Babesia and Theileria species differ in morphology, life cycle, epidemiology and the clinical signs produced in host species. Both genera are obligate intracellular parasites.

The parasite 18 S rRNA gene of five spotted hyaena samples was subsequently amplified, cloned and the recombinants sequenced. Homologous sequence searches of databases that were performed using the BLASTn package indicated that the obtained sequences were most closely related (98 – 99 % identity) to B. lengau, previously identified in cheetah in South Africa. The observed sequence similarities were subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analyses which showed that the obtained hyaena sequences formed a monophyletic group with B. lengau, B. conradae and sequences previously isolated from humans and wildlife in the western USA. Within the B. lengau clade, the obtained sequences and the published B. lengau sequences grouped into four distinct groups, of which groups I, II and III each represented a novel B. lengau genotype. It remains difficult to establish how much 18 S rRNA gene sequence variation must exist for the source organism to be considered a different species or to be considered merely a variant and/or genotype of a species. Based on this, as well as {{the fact that we do}} not have any data on the morphology of the parasites, their possible vectors or their role in clinical disease, we suggest that these genotypes cannot be classified as new Babesia species, but rather as variants of B. lengau. The study confirms that hyaena are susceptible to infection by a Babesia sp similar to B. lengau, but also demonstrates that they are not clinically affected by the infection.

The presence of bacteria in the gut lumen of fully developed embryos and "pharate" larvae suggest a <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> of intracellular symbionts (endocytobionts) in R. lucifugus. This <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> {{does not appear to be}} correlated with presence and differentiation of specialized cells such as bacteriocyte...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> of {{two species}} of begomovirus, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), through generations of Bemisia tabaci of the B and Q biotypes has been investigated. Different life stages of the progeny of {{viruliferous}} female whiteflies have been analysed by PCR detection of viral DNA and infectivity tests. Our results indicate that TYLCSV DNA can be detected in eggs and nymphs, {{and to a lesser}} extent adults, of the first-generation progeny. Infectivity tests using a large number of adult progeny of the first, second, and third generation indicate that even when viral DNA is inherited, infectivity is not. For TYLCV, neither viral DNA nor infectivity were associated with the progeny of viruliferous female whiteflies. Because the inherited viral DNA is unable to give rise to infections, the <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> of TYLCSV DNA appears to have no epidemiological relevance...|$|E

Some viruses {{can be transmitted}} from female parent to offspring usually through eggs, but the mechanism of this <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> remains unclear. Rice stripe virus (RSV), a Tenuivirus, transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus), is also spread to the offspring through the eggs. Here, we used the RSV–planthopper system as a model to investigate the mechanism of <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> and demonstrated {{the central role of}} vitellogenin (Vg) of L. striatellus in the process of virus transmission into the eggs. Our data showed Vg can bind to pc 3 in vivo and in vitro and colocalize in the germarium. RSV filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) only accumulated in the terminal filaments and pedicel areas prior to Vg expression and was not present in the germarium until Vg was expressed, where RSV RNPs and Vg had colocalized. Observations by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) also indicated that these two proteins colocalized in nurse cells. Knockdown of Vg expression due to RNA interference resulted in inhibition of the invasion of ovarioles by RSV. Together, the data obtained indicated that RSV RNPs may enter the nurse cell of the germarium via endocytosis through binding with Vg. Finally, the virus enters the oocytes through nutritive cords, using the same route as for Vg transport. Our results show that the Vg of L. striatellus {{played a critical role in}} <b>transovarial</b> <b>transmission</b> of RSV and shows how viruses can use existing transovaria...|$|E
