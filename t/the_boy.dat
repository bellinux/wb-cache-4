5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> with a knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> search for her, until <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E

As the video switches between Wade and <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground.

As <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> running away from a SWAT team in the woods. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground.

5|$|According to legend, Boyce {{was lost}} on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout {{came to his}} aid, guiding {{him back to his}} destination. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> then refused Boyce's tip, {{explaining}} that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who was the head of <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout Association at that time.

This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines.
