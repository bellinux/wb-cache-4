5|$|When the U.S. 7th Cavalry {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses {{had been left behind}} in the Wallowa valley when <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{dealt with}} several {{conflicts}} with Indian tribes. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce, led by Chief Joseph, began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O. Howard {{ordered them to}} move on to a reservation. Howard's men defeated <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce in battle, and the tribe began a 1,700-mile retreat into Canada. In October, after a decisive battle at Bear Paw, Montana, Chief Joseph surrendered and General William T. Sherman ordered the tribe transported to Kansas, where they were forced to remain until 1885. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce war was not the last conflict in the West, as the Bannock rose up in Spring 1878 and raided nearby settlements before being defeated by Howard's army in July of that year. War with the Ute tribe broke out in 1879 when the Utes killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker, who had been attempting to convert them to Christianity. The subsequent White River War ended when Schurz negotiated peace with the Ute and prevented the white Coloradans from taking revenge for Meeker's death.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce {{lost most}} of their horses after <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce War in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of {{dedicated}} breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) was formed as the breed registry in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the foundation bloodstock of the registry; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Nimiipuu (<b>Nez</b> Perce) have {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} thousands of years. The first people of European ancestry to visit the Lewiston area {{were members of the}} David Thompson expedition of 1803. Thompson was looking to establish fur trading posts for the Hudsons Bay Company of British North America (now Canada). Thompson established the first white settlement in Idaho, MacKenzies Post. But it soon failed as <b>the</b> local <b>Nez</b> Perce tribes men considered beaver trapping to be womens work, the tribe was migratory and apparently women thought they already had enough to do. This was followed by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in October, 1805. At the future townsite they encountered settlements of <b>the</b> native <b>Nez</b> Perce. Lewis and Clark passed through the valley on the return trip from the Pacific in 1806 also.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce band {{associated}} with Chief Joseph, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were {{being pursued by}} the U.S.Army and entered the national park about {{two weeks after the}} Battle of the Big Hole. Some of <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that no one should be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded. One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond. That stream is still known as Nez Perce Creek. A group of Bannocks entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce {{people lived}} in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and western Idaho, where they engaged in {{agriculture}} as well as horse breeding. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They {{took advantage of the}} fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, relatively safe from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} American horse breeds with leopard {{coloring}} and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger. Appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds {{in an attempt}} to create a leopard-spotted ambling horse. Because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for ApHC registration, their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability. In 1995 <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia. Appaloosa stallions have been exported to Denmark, to add new blood to the Knabstrup breed.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. <b>The</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively‚Äîtwo elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude L√©vi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, L√©vi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E

5|$|Today, the Appaloosa {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular breeds in the United States; it was named the {{official}} state horse of Idaho in 1975.

5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring. Nose {{piercing}} {{has been}} {{practiced by the}} Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa, as well as Australian Aboriginals. Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E
5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central {{to the lives of}} the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, <b>the</b> <b>Nez</b> Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
