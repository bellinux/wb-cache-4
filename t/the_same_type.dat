5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors.

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma.

German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species – Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type,</b> the royal antelope.

5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type.</b> The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E

If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E
