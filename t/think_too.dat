Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

[...] "I always think of editing as instinctive or impressionist. Not to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> much, in a way, and feel it more." [...] Nolan also avoids using temp music while cutting his films.|$|E
500|$|The final line recalls an old English saying: [...] "All his swans {{are turned}} to geese", meaning all his {{expectations}} end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, {{like a person}} who fancies he sees a swan on a river but finds it {{to be only a}} goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): [...] "All his geese are swans", which was commonly applied to people who <b>think</b> <b>too</b> much of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from Aesop's fable [...] "The Eagle and the Owl".|$|E

Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear {{in the form of}} [...] "dreams" [...] experienced by the primary protagonists. Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna's point of view, although he does not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> highly of Laguna. Laguna attacks with a Machine gun and his Limit Break is Desperado, which involves a swinging rope, a grenade, and a barrage of bullets. During the dream segments, he is a twenty-seven-year-old soldier in the Galbadian army who travels with his companions, Kiros Seagill and Ward Zabac. He is also an aspiring journalist.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] was a [...] "supremely catchy pop tune" [...] {{and that the}} video was [...] "the {{perfectly}} blissed-out accompaniment." [...] Montgomery chided the video for [...] "not making much sense" [...] but noted [...] "that hardly matters" [...] as [...] "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect formula for pop success: Don't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> big, or too much. Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like I said, you can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't ever say she's not smart." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Sid Smith {{found the}} film to be [...] "pretty lousy, despite a wealth of {{impressive}} special effects that end with {{an image of a}} completely demolished Chicago skyline." [...] He found the plot to be overly melodramatic and [...] "hokey" [...] with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as [...] "a little entertaining supertrash" [...] that does require one to not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> much about the science to enjoy.|$|E

500|$|Before Other Ms development, Sakamoto did not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> {{much about}} [...] "what {{kind of person}} Samus Aran was and how she thinks and her personality", {{particularly}} because the games tried to depict Samus as a mysterious person. Sakamoto and Team Ninja put much focus on backstory in the game to present Samus as an [...] "appealing human character", something important for future installments, as players would get further interest in Samus' adventures. Hayashi {{said that one of}} the development team's goals was to have the player [...] "connect with Samus as the story and action develops". Sakamoto also said the game would [...] "bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe", and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans. The chronological setting between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion was chosen because Sakamoto considered the period [...] "so critical that without addressing it, we wouldn't be able to make new games that show Samus' adventures that take place after the events of Metroid Fusion".|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as {{he shook his head}} and remarked, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree that they would not stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people <b>think</b> <b>too.</b> It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E

[...] "I hope I may be able to work on right hard during the next three years, otherwise I shall never have finished, – but I find the noddle & the stomach are antagonist powers, and that it is a great deal more easy to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> much in a day, than to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> little – What thought has to do with digesting roast beef, – I cannot say, but they are brother faculties." ...|$|E

The tension in Miller's songs—it's never resolved—between guitar-driven pop and keyboard-based New Wave is like the tension between heart and mind, between a nerdy {{identity}} never fully embraced and a fear of something more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simon pursued solo {{projects}} after Bridge over Troubled Water, reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel {{for various}} projects, {{such as their}} 1975 Top Ten single [...] "My Little Town." [...] Simon wrote it for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon judged as lacking [...] "bite." [...] The song was included on their respective solo albums—Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel's Breakaway. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical of Simon's early life in New York City. In 1981, they reunited again for the famous concert in Central Park, followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album, to have been entitled <b>Think</b> <b>Too</b> Much, which was eventually released (without Garfunkel) as Hearts and Bones. Together, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win".
