Designed in 1996 to {{emphasize the importance of}} teamwork in overcoming adversity, the Crucible is a rigorous 54-hour field training exercise demanding the application of everything a recruit has learned until that point in recruit training and includes a total of 48 miles of marching. It simulates typical combat situations with strenuous testing, hardship and the deprivation of food and sleep. Two recruits are given three MREs (a self-contained, individual field ration), each usually taking one, then splitting the third up how ever is agreeable between the two. The recruits are only allowed six hours of sleep through the entire 54-hour event. Recruits are broken into squad-sized teams (possibly smaller) and placed under the charge of one drill instructor. West Coast recruits are returned to Edson Range for the Crucible. Parris Island recruits will conduct the Crucible in the derelict Page Airfield on {{the south end of the}} depot.|$|E

This paper seeks to investigate the maintenance characteristics of HVAC system that affect occupants' satisfaction and subsequently establish a relationship between the characteristics and occupants' satisfaction through questionnaire surveys and interviews; and finally develop a regression model for prediction purpose. The findings reveal that the maintenance characteristics which influence occupants' satisfaction include <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> of <b>the</b> manager, <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> of <b>the</b> labourer, the quality of spare parts and materials, as well as the response level towards failure and downtime.

According to the contract, LEMA was responsible for operating and managing water and wastewater services in the Greater Amman area on behalf of WAJ. The original five-year contract which began in August 1999 was extended until December 2006. The contract was intended to strengthen the technical structure and management capability {{as well as to}} develop <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the staff.
