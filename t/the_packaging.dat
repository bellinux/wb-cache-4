50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is the weight of <b>the</b> <b>package</b> at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of <b>the</b> <b>package</b> {{as if it were}} of the chosen density (what <b>the</b> <b>package</b> would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> <b>The</b> freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine <b>the</b> <b>package</b> volume. If <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b> However, if <b>the</b> <b>package</b> is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of <b>the</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>packaging</b> has {{undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. <b>The</b> <b>packaging</b> was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that <b>the</b> <b>packaging,</b> from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into {{a recording studio}} and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.|$|E

Dennett, highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous.

If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded.

No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation.
