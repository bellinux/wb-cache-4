5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> This crystallises <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E

40|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that calcium chelators enhance heat stability in milk. However, they increase the heat stability to considerably different extents. For this reason, {{the effect of}} various calcium chelators on heat coagulation and heat-induced changes of concentrated micellar casein solutions was investigated by measuring the heat coagulation time (HCT), together with changes in calcium-ion activity, viscosity, turbidity, and zeta potential before and after heating. Surprisingly, the weakest chelator, disodium uridine monophosphate (Na 2 UMP), gave the most pronounced increase in HCT. Stronger chelators, i. e., disodium hydrogen <b>phosphate,</b> <b>trisodium</b> citrate and sodium phytate, gave a lower HCT than Na 2 UMP. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) was the least effective heat stabilizer. Heat-induced changes in SHMP were the major cause for this reduced heat stability effect. Differences in HCT caused {{by the addition of}} the various calcium chelators could be attributed to the calcium-ion activity and state of the micellar structure before and during heating...|$|R
