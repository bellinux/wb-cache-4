Second, we find a high degree <b>of</b> consistency in <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> children name in their first words, independent of the age at which they are produced.

Before Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council this {{did not have to}} be a dangerous item (see below); the risk was instead in its behaviour if it escapes. In Rylands the [...] "thing" [...] was water. Other examples are fire, as in Jones v Festiniog Railway, gas, as in Batchellor v Tunbridge Wells Gas Co, fumes, as in West v Bristol Tramways Co, and electricity, as in Hillier v Air Ministry. The extent of the [...] "thing"'s accumulation can also be considered, as in Mason v Levy, where it was not just <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> kept but the sheer amount which created the danger. It is essential for a Rylands claim that there be an escape of a dangerous thing [...] "from a place where the defendant has occupation of or control over land to a place which is outside his occupation or control". In Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd, an explosion in a munitions factory killed an inspector on the property. Rylands was held not to apply, because there was no escape. The dangerous thing that escapes does not always have to be the thing which was accumulated, but there must be a causal link. In Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co (Leicestershire) Ltd, explosives stored on the defendant's land led to the escape of rocks in a blast, and the defendant was found liable.|$|E

Despite this, there is still a great deal <b>of</b> confusion about <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that are eligible for patent protection.

Focusing on recent litigation in the United States and Australia involving Myriad Genetics’ patents for the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes, this Article argues that while some of the uncertainty that accompanies the subject-matter inquiry is inevitable, many of the problems associated with subject matter eligibility arise because there is no real clarity about the criteria to be used when categorizing subject matter in patent law. Thus, it will be argued that patent law in the United States and Australia is ill equipped for the task of determining subject matter eligibility, at least {{in a way that does}} not seem to be arbitrary and capricious...|$|R

For Gale, our parsing algorithm is expected to accurately parse various different materials, ranging from newswire text, which tends to be grammatically well formed, to n-best ASR outputs, many of which are poorly formed sentences. To address this challenge, we have re-implemented and enhanced the Berkeley parser to handle unknown Chinese words efficiently, parse difficult sentences robustly, and operate more efficiently. We also address issues related to training the parser for several different genres given a limited number of available training trees, the importance of matching word segmentation to the treebank segmentation standard to support accurate parsing, and the need for standardized tokenization for managing <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that will appear as input to the parser. Understanding and handling these issues is a prerequisite for achieving adequate parsing performance levels. We also investigate self-training with automatically labeled in-domain data to enhance parsing performance given the limited number of trees in the Chinese treebanks. ...|$|R

40|$|There various methods, in science, {{as to how}} we {{formulate}} a relationship between observation and theory. Logical positivism developed a linguistic approach {{to determine whether a}} claim is empirically meaningful. This depends on whether a particular statement can be tested.

Rather, evidence is extralinguistic, and are not instances or words or statements. This latter notion inspired me to contrast Bogen and Woodward's view against Nietzsche's ideas about language. I interpret him to think that language is necessary for the intellect to assimilate reality, but even in doing so, language does not provide us with an epistemic depiction of reality, rather, it is a creative construction of our affairs.

40|$|Current {{philosophical}} orthodoxy has it {{that the}} human mind is set apart from the minds of other animals by the kinds of propositional attitudes and/or conscious states that human beings are able to entertain.

It didn't take long, though, for us to realize that a data communications protocol is just a special case of a general distributed process system, with asynchronously executing and interacting concurrent processes. This covers both multi-threaded software systems with shared memory, and physically distributed systems, interacting via network channels.

The theory on humor indicated the many different ways to interpret why and how people laugh and under what given conditions. Because humor is both simple and complex, there is no set explanation {{to account for the}} wide array of smiles and laughter that can be joyful or contemptuous, overt or secretive and deceptive. Research regarding the psychological aspects offered more possibility in terms of acknowledging individual or sociological reactions. Because laughter is intimate, humane, involuntary (similar to crying) and highly subjective, it is of profound interest to the psychologist by way of relating a projective-type ???funniest story??? which will reveal unconscious conflict or comedy through play therapy. The laughter is a veil that disguises unacceptable behavior and thought, when the veil is lifted not only is unconscious thought revealed but the laughter is no longer funny. Most of what we laugh at is a bittersweet mixture of our own situation.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the setting}} of an acute {{coronary}} syndrome, the natural inclination {{of friends and family}} members is to provide social support. However, their efforts may be perceived as being problematic or unhelpful. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the characteristics of problematic social support interactions from the perspectives of patients. Methods This was a qualitative study among a purposive sample of 59 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome. Patients were asked: "Can you describe <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that your family members, close friends, and health care providers did during this period to try to be helpful or supportive but you felt was unhelpful or felt that it caused you more stress. " Responses were analyzed using qualitative techniques and reviewed by two independent corroborators. Results <b>The</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> behaviors performed by social network members that were perceived as being unhelpful were grouped under 5 themes: (1) excessive telephone contact, (2) high expression of emotions, (3) unsolicited advice, (4) information without means for implementation, and (5) taking over. Conclusion Patients in this study described actions of their social network members that were intended to be supportive but instead were perceived as problematic because they were in excess of what was needed, they were incongruous with what was desired, or they contributed to negative feelings. Helping social networks to understand the potential problematic aspects of social support can aid in tailoring effective social support interventions. </p...|$|R
