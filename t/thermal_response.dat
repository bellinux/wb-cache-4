Previous work has identified {{the interplay of}} PIF 4 and ELF 3 as a central circuit underlying <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF 3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF 3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis {{to test the hypothesis}} that natural polyQ variation in ELF 3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> beyond modulating general ELF 3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF 3 plays a crucial, PIF 4 -independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF 3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with different <b>thermal</b> <b>responses,</b> we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains. Our findings tie together disparate observations into a coherent framework in which multiple pathways converge in accelerating flowering in response to temperature, with some such pathways modulated by photoperiod...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) optics (the primary mirror segment, the secondary mirror, and the tertiary mirror) was performed using finite element analysis in ANSYS and I-DEAS. In the thermal analysis, each of the optical assemblies (mirror, mirror supports, cell) was modeled for various thermal conditions including air convections, conductions, heat flux loadings, and radiations. The thermal time constant of each mirror was estimated and the temperature distributions of the mirror assemblies were calculated under the various thermal loading conditions. The thermo-elastic analysis was made to obtain the thermal deformation based on the resulting temperature distributions. The optical performance of the TMT optics was evaluated from the thermally induced mirror deformations. The goal of this thermal analysis is to establish thermal models by the FEA programs to simulate for an adequate thermal environment. These thermal models can be utilized for estimating the <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> of the TMT optics.

40|$|Whether {{the thermal}} {{sensitivity}} of an organism's traits follows the simple Boltzmann-Arrhenius model remains a contentious issue that centers around consideration of its operational temperature range {{and whether the}} sensitivity corresponds to {{one or a few}} underlying rate-limiting enzymes. Resolving this issue is crucial, because mechanistic models for temperature dependence of traits are required to predict the biological effects of climate change. Here, by combining theory with data on 1, 085 <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> {{from a wide range of}} traits and organisms, we show that substantial variation in thermal sensitivity (activation energy) estimates can arise simply because of variation in the range of measured temperatures. Furthermore, when <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> deviate systematically from the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, variation in measured temperature ranges across studies can bias estimated activation energy distributions toward higher mean, median, variance, and skewness. Remarkably, this bias alone can yield activation energies that encompass the range expected from biochemical reactions (from ∼ 0. 2 to 1. 2 eV), making it difficult to establish whether a single activation energy appropriately captures thermal sensitivity. We provide guidelines and a simple equation for partially correcting for such artifacts. Our results have important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> of biological traits and for accurately modeling effects of variation in <b>thermal</b> sensitivity on <b>responses</b> of individuals, populations, and ecological communities to changing climatic temperatures...|$|R

This is generally called Ground <b>Thermal</b> <b>Response</b> Testing (TRT) by the GHP industry. [...] Understanding the ground conductivity and thermal capacity is essential to proper GHP design, and using TRT to measure these properties was first presented in 1983 (Mogensen). The now commonly used procedure, introduced by Eklöf and Gehlin in 1996 and now approved by ASHRAE involves inserting a pipe loop deep into the ground (in a well bore, filling the anulus of the bore with a grout substance of known thermal properties, heating the fluid in the pipe loop, and measuring the temperature drop in the loop from the inlet and return pipes in the bore.

Comparisons between experimentally observed temperatures and calculated values have shown that a suitable value for surface thermal emissivity is 0. 35; modelling of the fuel element beyond the region of the fuel plate needs to be included since these areas account for approximately 25 per cent of the thermal power dissipated; general agreement between calculated and experimental temperatures for both transient and steady-state conditions is good - the maximum discrepancy between calculated and experimental temperatures for a HIFAR Mark IV/V fuel element is approx 70 deg C and for an Oak Ridge Reactor (ORR) box-type fuel element approx 30 deg C; and axial power distribution does not significantly affect <b>thermal</b> <b>responses</b> for the conditions investigated.
