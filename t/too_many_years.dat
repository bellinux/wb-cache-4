25|$|A rebel {{during the}} reign of Kamose, Teti son of Pepi, has been {{identified}} by Vandersleyen as the same person as Teti son of Minhotep, by arguing that Pepi is a diminutive of Minhotep. If these two persons were the same person, it would require that the reign of Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose could not be separated by <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> However, Wolfgang Helck has argued that the frequency of these names is due instead to a large family in the area of Coptos with ties to the Sixth Dynasty, since Teti and Pepy were names of important Sixth Dynasty Pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the future}} storyline where the Sentinels exterminated most mutants {{and went on}} to kill regular humans as well, the elderly Magneto allies with the X-Men's {{remnants}} in a monastery in China. He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the Sentinels' creation by stopping Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to succumb to his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends spent <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.|$|E
500|$|There were genuine {{differences}} of opinion over policy between MacArthur and the Truman administration. One was MacArthur's deep-seated belief {{that it was not}} possible to separate the struggle against Communism in Europe from that going on in Asia. This was seen as the result of being stationed for <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> in the Orient, and of his perspective as a theater commander responsible only for part of the Far East. Another important policy difference was MacArthur's belief that China was not, as Acheson maintained, [...] "the Soviet Union's largest and most important satellite," [...] but an independent state with its own agenda that, in MacArthur's words, [...] "for its own purposes is [...] allied with Soviet Russia." [...] If MacArthur's thesis was accepted, then it followed that expanding the war with China would not provoke a conflict with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs emphatically disagreed, although this contradicted their position that it was Europe and not Asia that was the prime concern of the Soviet Union. Even among Republicans, there was little support for MacArthur's position.|$|E

500|$|Cagney's {{penultimate}} {{film was}} a comedy. He was hand-picked by Billy Wilder {{to play a}} hard-driving Coca-Cola executive in the film One, Two, Three. Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to Boy Meets Girl, in which scenes were reshot {{to try to make}} them funnier by speeding up the pacing, with the opposite effect. Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced. Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes, something to which Cagney was unaccustomed. In fact, {{it was one of the}} worst experiences of his long career. For the first time, Cagney considered walking out of a film. He felt he had worked <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> inside studios, and combined with a visit to Dachau concentration camp during filming, he decided that he had had enough, and retired afterward. One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with Pamela Tiffin, to whom he gave acting guidance, including the secret that he had learned over his career: [...] "You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Political {{maneuvering}} {{was setting}} the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a [...] "Committee of Five" [...] to draft a declaration, consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited. What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally. Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly. He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was [...] "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E

2500|$|Emma then teams up with Henry to form [...] "Operation Cobra: Part II." [...] Henry {{offers to}} create a locator spell, using a magic potion from Gold's pawn shop. On board the Jolly Roger, Hook and Gold begin their battle, with Hook using magic to repair Gold's {{crippled}} leg to give him [...] "a fair fight." [...] Despite Gold's efforts, Hook backs Gold into a corner and draws blood with his hook, saying that he will enjoy the final blow. This gives Henry and Emma enough time to find the dreamcatchers, which happen to be located inside the clock tower, only for them to discover that they are protected by a spell. Henry decides to trust Emma again, and uses a magic potion to remove her cuffs, which allows her to remove the dreamcatchers from Hook's protection spell. Back on the ship, Gold is able {{to take control of}} the fight, when the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin distracts Hook by telling him to kill the actual Mr. Gold, who seizes the opportunity to drop a weight on Hook and seize Excalibur. When Hook recovers from the impact, Gold decides to let Hook live forever, with the memory of being beaten by Gold. Hook says that [...] his victory was only temporary, and disappears. When Gold meets Belle at the well, she informs Gold she wants to [...] "step back" [...] in their relationship. She tells him that she spent <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> trying to mend Gold's heart and now, she wants to protect her own heart, leaving a heartbroken Rumplestiltskin at the well. As Emma and Henry distribute the dreamcatchers to everyone and restores their memories, Emma has a realization as she learns that Hook intentionally lost the duel to Gold, so that he could get a drop of Gold's blood. It turns out that Hook planned to use the blood at the pond, for a spell that opens a portal into the Underworld. Hook opens the portal and summons all of the previous Dark Ones (minus Rumplestiltskin), led by Nimue, to aid him in destroying light magic.|$|E
