30|$|Taiwan’s {{auditing}} standards bulletin No. 16 stipulates that the compilation of financial statements is {{often based on}} an assumption of going concern. It further requires that auditors shall comply with the stipulations as specified in the bulletin when they evaluate reasonable assumptions of going concern. CPAs are able to issue unqualified opinion audit reports if they eliminate their doubt {{about the ability of}} going concern after evaluating the rationality of the assumption of going concern. If <b>CPAs</b> consider <b>the</b> auditee’s future measures are reasonable and necessary to be disclosed in the financial report, then a qualified opinion audit report or an adverse opinion audit report is needed. If <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> cannot eliminate doubts about the auditee’s ability of going concern, but the auditee’s financial statements have been disclosed, then <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> <b>shall</b> issue an unqualified-modified opinion audit report. If the auditee’s financial statements have not been properly disclosed, then <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> <b>shall</b> issue a qualified opinion audit report or an adverse opinion audit report depending on the significance. If a CPA has confirmed that the assumption of going concern for the compilation of financial statements is not consistent with the actual situation and would have serious consequences, then <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> <b>shall</b> issue an adverse audit opinion report. If <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> cannot eliminate doubt, or the assumption is not consistent with the actual situation, then explanatory notes {{should be included in the}} audit report, and these notes should form the audit report (Auditing Standards Board of the Republic of China Accounting Research Development Foundation, Auditing standard bulletin and auditing practice, 2013).|$|R

But the IAMB found that <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> had {{chosen not to}} repair the meters on the pipelines. The IAMB told <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> that they were concerned {{that the lack of}} metering made auditing Iraq's oil exports unreliable - making it impossible to detect fraud, deception or smuggling. The minutes of the IAMB meeting make clear that <b>the</b> <b>CPA</b> had assured <b>the</b> IAMB that they {{were in the process of}} repairing the meters - in bad faith. <b>The</b> <b>CPA's</b> authority came to an end with the meters unrepaired.
