25|$|The <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> engines produce {{substantially}} lower emissions {{than most}} other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than <b>Tier</b> <b>4,</b> and showed that at peak frequency the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any pollution level above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute {{on the order of}} 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human health assessment in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> emission controls on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{citizens}} can {{study in the}} United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need {{to apply for a}} visa {{as long as they do}} not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand {{citizens can}} apply for a <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> student visa outside New Zealand or the UK.

25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> {{emissions}} standards-compliant {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3–4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are bigger power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel Injection System that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, GE {{unveiled}} its first <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> emissions-compliant locomotive, now officially named the ET44AC.

While the front third of the locomotive, including the control cab, is basically unchanged, the rear two-thirds is noticeably different. On <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> demonstrator units the entire midsection above the prime mover is raised to accommodate an advanced exhaust treatment system; {{it is seen as}} a [...] "hump" [...] that rises above the rest of the locomotive considerably. Production units have this hump only over the exhaust manifold directly ahead of the radiator, rather than encompassing the entire midsection. In addition, the radiator section is much larger than that of earlier [...] "ES" [...] units, featuring a two-fan split-cooling system located inside a very large, angular compartment. Grilles under the radiator section have been smoothed out, and there are two extra air intakes on the rear of the locomotive hood. ET44ACs are all equipped with Graham-White electronic bells (E-bells). <b>Tier</b> <b>4</b> demonstrator units are equipped with two airhorns: a three-chime horn - facing forward - located behind the cab and a rear-facing two-chime horn protruding {{from the back of the}} radiator.
