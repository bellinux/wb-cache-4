5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> the angle between the actual path of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (the angle that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E

50|$|Tires {{come with}} {{standardized}} tire code sizing information, {{found on the}} sidewalls of <b>the</b> <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> first letter(s), indicate the vehicle type (P for passenger, LT for light truck). The next three digits indicate <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> width in millimeters. The middle two digit number indicates <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> height-to-width ratio. <b>The</b> next character is a letter 'R,' which indicates radial ply tires (rather than radius). followed by a final two digit number indicating the rim size for the vehicle's wheels.|$|R
50|$|During {{a routine}} pit stop, <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> {{are laid out}} beforehand, and three of <b>the</b> four <b>tire</b> changers are pre-positioned before the car enters its pit stall. <b>The</b> fourth <b>tire</b> changer, whose {{responsibility}} is <b>the</b> rear <b>tire</b> on <b>the</b> far side of pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the feed hose for the impact wrench used to change <b>the</b> <b>tires,</b> and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses.|$|R
5|$|A third safety car {{period was}} caused by the Creation Autosportif entry, which ran into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{barriers}} at the Porsche Curves and needed to be extracted. The Creation returned to the pits but eventually retired. The Kruse Motorsport entry also suffered problems when it briefly stopped at the pit entrance during the caution period, blocking other cars attempting to make their own pit stops. The Kruse entry eventually succeeded in getting to its garage.|$|E
5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E

50|$|In {{the middle}} of <b>the</b> Goodyear-Hoosier <b>tire</b> war, Hoosier {{released}} teams from their contracts three days following Orr's death. Hoosier received blame from some observers as <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> were <b>the</b> only linking factor between the two deaths. However, the criticism was purely speculative and NASCAR never blamed <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> for <b>the</b> deaths and never offered an official cause of accident for either fatalities.|$|R
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{the couple}} moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon {{took a job}} at the Office of Price Administration. In his {{political}} campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier. He was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy. As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night.|$|E
5|$|One of North America's major {{radio and}} {{television}} broadcasters from the 1950s through the late 1980s, RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of the Yankee Network by General Tire. In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together {{under the rubric of}} RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, GenCorp's) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, Muzak (dept. store and elevator piped-in) music, Video Independent Theatre (135 theatres strong) Circuit, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original Frontier Airlines.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, several state {{agencies}} in Arizona began experiencing major issues with Firestone tires on Explorers.

5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E
5|$|Edwards passed Earnhardt {{to reclaim}} the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further {{position}} after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two groove. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box {{but he was not}} penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Kenseth led the field back up to speed on the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. Casey Mears hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, a further four stoppages occurred; Alex Zanardi slid and made light {{contact with the}} turn eight tire barrier and did not restart, metal debris was spotted in between turns three and four, Max Wilson stalled his car after he spun in the third turn, and Franchitti and Memo Gidley made contact in turn five and the latter was sent into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> barrier which heavily damaged his right-hand suspension while Franchitti's right-front wheel broke. De Ferran set the fastest lap of {{the day with a}} time of 58.400 seconds, ahead of Fittipaldi and Franchitti. Kanaan was fourth-fastest; ahead of Andretti and his teammate Tracy. Da Matta, Tagliani, Max Papis and Adrián Fernández followed in the top ten. Shinji Nakano paced the final practice session with a time of 58.133 seconds; Kanaan was second and Junqueira third. De Ferran was fourth-quickest, ahead of Andretti and da Matta. Oriol Servià was seventh-fastest, Bryan Herta eighth, Fernández ninth and Maurício Gugelmin completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. The session was stopped four times: firstly for Vasser who stalled on the circuit; the second for Kanaan because his engine failed heading towards the start-finish line, the third was for Bräck who slid and hit the turn eight outside tyre wall with his left front wheel and his suspension was broken. The final red-flag was for Vasser who locked his brakes and spun 360 degrees into the turn eight run off area.|$|E
5000|$|When a plane lands, <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> are not spinning.
