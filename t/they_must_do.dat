25|$|A similar issue arises for {{passengers}} arriving at Wimbledon by tram. Normally tram users {{do not touch}} out, but at Wimbledon <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so to leave the station; touching out at the regular turnstile accomplishes this. If, however, a passenger touches their card at a standalone Oyster reader (such as the one by the manual gates), the system will see this as starting a new journey rather than ending one, and will deduct a maximum fare from the card.|$|E
25|$|Another {{version of}} Suicide {{is played by}} four players, playing as partners. The bidding {{is the same as}} normal, except that one person in each team is forced to bid nil, so if the leading partner does not bid nil <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so. This limits the hands which the first and second person want to bid a non-Nil amount, as if {{they do not have the}} ace of spades, they cannot place it and {{therefore}} risk having it in their partner's hand.|$|E
25|$|An Indrik {{composite}} {{from all}} the variants of the ballads depicts the Indrik as dwelling in the Holy Mountain, which it consumes for sustenance. It is the mother or the father of all animals. It wanders unseen on the plain by day. When other beasts encounter it <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> obeisance. The Indrik saves the world from drought by digging springs of pure water. By night, it wanders in the subterranean world, forging a path with its horn. There it purifies all the waters and releases them from any blockages.|$|E

25|$|A maul {{occurs when}} a player {{carrying}} the ball is held {{by one or more}} opponents, and {{one or more of the}} ball carrier's teammates bind on the ball carrier. Once a maul has formed other players may join in but, as in a ruck, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so from their own side. If the maul stops moving forward, and the ball is not available to be played, then the referee awards a scrum to the side not in possession when the maul began (unless the maul was formed immediately after a player received a kick other than a kick-off). The tactic of the rolling maul occurs when mauls are set up, and the ball is passed backwards through the players' hands to one at the rear, who rolls off the side to change the direction of the drive. This tactic can be extremely effective in gaining ground and both doing it properly and preventing it takes great skill and technique. It is a tactic most commonly used when the attacking side is inside the defending side's 22 meter line.|$|E
25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> all they can to protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who now wants to aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that he himself has fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E
2500|$|A player cannot {{choose to}} go bankrupt; {{if there is any}} way to pay what they owe, even in {{returning}} all their buildings at a loss, mortgaging all their real estate and giving up all their cash and certainly going bankrupt the next time they have to pay something, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so.

2500|$|Racewalking is {{a long-distance}} {{athletic}} event. Although it is a foot race, {{it is different}} from running in that one foot must {{appear to be in}} contact with the ground at all times. Stride length is reduced, so to achieve competitive speeds, racewalkers must attain cadence rates comparable to those achieved by Olympic 800-meter runners, and <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so {{for hours at a time}} since the Olympic events are the 20 km (12.4mi) race walk (men and women) [...] and 50 km (31 mi) race walk (men only), and 50 mile (80.5km) events are also held.

2500|$|During {{shooting}} missions, {{the game}} auto-targets the closest opponent. If the player wishes to switch target to another opponent, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> so manually.

At this point, the game switches to first-person, zooms {{in on the}} target, and goes into slow motion momentarily. While in Precision Targeting, if the targeting reticule turns blue, the player can hit the enemy with a neutralizing, non-lethal shot. If the player fires when the reticule is red, the enemy will be killed instantly. Players can also take cover during shootouts, firing from behind cover when the opportunity presents itself.

2500|$|On 3 June 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith {{published}} a document with {{the agreement of}} Pope John Paul II called [...] "Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions Between Homosexual Persons" [...] opposing {{the very idea of}} same-sex marriage. This document made clear that [...] "legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour ... but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity". Catholic legislators were instructed that supporting such recognition would be [...] "gravely immoral", and that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> all they could do actively oppose it, bearing in mind that [...] "the approval or legalisation of evil is something far different from the toleration of evil". The document said that allowing children to be adopted by people living in homosexual union would actually mean doing violence to them, and stated: [...] "There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family. Marriage is holy, while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill {{returns to}} the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by {{a man with a}} note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. After reading a {{newspaper}} story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. [...] Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with {{the events of the past}} night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd [...] "sacrificed" [...] herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the [...] "punishment" [...] was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him and there is something <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, [...] "Fuck".|$|E
