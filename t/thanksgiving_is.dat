25|$|On Thanksgiving Day, {{families}} and friends usually gather for a large meal or dinner. Consequently, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend {{is one of the}} busiest travel periods of the year. <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges. Most business and government workers (78% in 2007) are given Thanksgiving and the day after as paid holidays. Thanksgiving Eve, the night before <b>Thanksgiving,</b> <b>is</b> one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs (where it is often identified by the derogatory name Blackout Wednesday), as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> {{a federal}} holiday, all United States {{government}} offices are closed and all employees {{are paid for}} that day. It is also a holiday for the New York Stock Exchange and most other financial markets and financial services companies.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> {{celebrated in}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{for the first time}} in 1630, and {{frequently}} thereafter until about 1680, when it became an annual festival in that colony. <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> {{celebrated in the}} Connecticut Colony as early as 1639 and annually after 1647, except in 1675. The colonists of New Netherland appointed a day for giving thanks in 1644 and occasionally thereafter.|$|R
25|$|Below {{the chapel}} is the Hall of Thanksgiving, which {{tells the story}} of the American Thanksgiving tradition. The Hall of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> the exhibition, meeting, and {{resource}} center for Thanks-Giving Square. The pillared hall receives dignitaries and provides a forum for lectures, interfaith meetings, and educational programming. Artifacts on display include the Book of Prayers and Presidential Proclamations.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor are}} often {{provided}} with food at Thanksgiving time. Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners. The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners {{to hundreds of}} people in different locales. Additionally, pegged to be five days after <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> Giving Tuesday, a celebration of charitable giving.|$|E
25|$|Thanksgiving {{occurred}} {{later in}} 1888 and 1899 than is possible under current U.S. law: {{as a result}} of changes between 1939 and 1941, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> always held on the fourth Thursday in November. The last time the fourth Thursday of November fell within Hanukkah before 2013 was in 1861, before Thanksgiving existed. As a result of this confusion, some media reports have mistakenly claimed that Thanksgivukkah had never occurred prior to 2013.|$|E

25|$|In ice hockey, the National Hockey League announced, {{as part of}} its decade-long {{extension}} with NBC, {{that they}} would begin airing a game on the Friday afternoon following Thanksgiving beginning the 2011–12 NHL season; the game has since been branded as the Thanksgiving Showdown. (The Boston Bruins have played matinees on Black Friday since at least 1990, but 2011 is the first time the game has been nationally televised.) The NHL has played games on Thanksgiving, usually scheduling games involving Canadian teams (but not always, {{as was the case in}} 2016, when the league scheduled a nationally televised game Thanksgiving night between two American teams on the West Coast). In Canada, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> in October, although no games were scheduled in 2011 and only one was scheduled in 2012 (both the Thanksgiving Showdown and the lone Canadian game on U.S. Thanksgiving were canceled as a result of a labor dispute in 2012); as a result of the effective day off, almost all of the league's teams play the day after Thanksgiving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> {{a day off}} for some {{companies}} and most schools, particularly those that remain open on Columbus Day. It is known as Black Friday and has historically been known as a day for chaotic, early-morning sales at major retailers that were historically closed on Thanksgiving; those who oppose the consumerist nature of the day can instead participate in Buy Nothing Day. [...] The day after <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> also Native American Heritage Day, a day {{to pay tribute to}} Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Eucharist" [...] (<b>thanksgiving)</b> <b>is</b> that {{by which}} the rite is {{referred}} by the Didache (late 1st or early 2nd century), Ignatius of Antioch (who died between 98 and 117) and Justin Martyr (writing between 147 and 167). [...] Today, [...] "the Eucharist" [...] is the name still used by Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholics, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Lutherans. Other Protestant denominations rarely use this term, preferring either [...] "Communion", [...] "the Lord's Supper", or [...] "the Breaking of Bread".|$|E
50|$|When <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> first celebrated, Puerto Rico {{was not a}} part of the United States and did not {{recognize}} the holiday. After officially becoming a commonwealth, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> eagerly accepted by the people as their own and has become one of the most celebrated vacations (holidays) of the year. As many regions of the Continental United States have, they've also put their own twist on this classic American tradition.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, {{certain kinds}} of food are {{traditionally}} served at Thanksgiving meals. Turkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on any Thanksgiving feast table, {{so much so that}} <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> colloquially known as [...] "Turkey Day." [...] In fact, 45 million turkeys were consumed on Thanksgiving Day alone in 2015. With 85 percent of Americans partaking in the meal, that’s an estimated 276 million Americans dining on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is {{a public}} holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It {{originated}} as a [...] harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1864, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of [...] "Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens," [...] to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. [...] Together with Christmas and the New Year, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of the}} broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|The precise {{definition}} of feasts and festival days that are encompassed by the Christmas and holiday season has become controversial in the United States over recent decades. While {{in other countries}} the only holidays included in the [...] "season" [...] are Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day/Boxing Day, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and Epiphany, in recent times, this definition in the U.S. has begun to expand to include Yule, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The expansion of the holiday season in the U.S. to encompass <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> believed to have begun in the 1920s, when major department stores Macy's and Gimbels launched dueling Thanksgiving Day parades to promote Christmas sales. Due to the phenomenon of Christmas creep and the informal inclusion of Thanksgiving, the Christmas and holiday season has begun to extend earlier into the year, overlapping Veterans/Remembrance/Armistice Day, Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night.|$|E

2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of [...] "Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences" [...] to break bread. Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not have to feel guilty, but we do need to feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting." [...] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving have been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving).|$|E
2500|$|The Chapel of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>is</b> {{the spiritual}} center of Thanks-Giving Square open to {{visitors}} of all faiths. The spiraling shape rises 90 feet (27.5 m) above street level, suggesting the infinite upward {{reach of the}} human spirit. The Chapel’s design takes its inspiration from the Great Mosque in Samarra, Iraq (itself derived from the square, spiral Pillar of Gor in Persia) and the ancient spiral of life. The entrance to the chapel {{is at the end}} of a 125-foot (38 m) bridge that runs over a cascading waterfall. The chapel ceiling contains the stained glass [...] "Glory Window", one of largest horizontally mounted stained-glass pieces in the world. The 73 panels of faceted glass were designed by Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France featuring warmer and brighter colors as the spiral reaches its apex in the center. The window appears in a shot in director Terrence Malick's 2011 film The Tree of Life. Above the entry door is the etched glass window [...] "The Spirit of Thanksgiving," [...] designed by glass engraver John Hutton. Artwork by artist Bjørn Wiinblad is also on display. Visitors are encouraged to leave a personal statement of gratitude upon entering.|$|E

2500|$|Thanksgiving Day fell during Hanukkah {{at least}} twice between 1863 (when <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed a U.S. federal holiday by President Abraham Lincoln) and 2013: in 1888 <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> {{the first day of}} Hanukkah, and in 1899 it was the fourth day.

25|$|The Pilgrims held a true thanksgiving {{celebration in}} 1623 {{following}} a fast, and a refreshing 14-day rain {{which resulted in}} a larger harvest.

In Love's opinion this 1623 <b>thanksgiving</b> <b>was</b> significant because the order to recognize the event was from civil authority (Governor Bradford), and not from the church, making it likely the first civil recognition of Thanksgiving in New England.|$|R
