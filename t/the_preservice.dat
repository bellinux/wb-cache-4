40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Prospective {{teachers}} enter {{teacher education}} programs with previously formed conceptions of geometry and its teaching. These conceptions help them make sense of new information about teaching, their roles as teachers, and their translation of mathematics into learning activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationships among preservice teachers' conceptions of geometry, conceptions of teaching geometry and classroom practices. Ten preservice mathematics teachers completed a card sort task with an interview. They also participated in a videotape task which consisted of viewing three experienced geometry teachers on videotape. Four of these preservice teachers were observed eight times each during their professional internship experience. All interviews and observations were videotaped and transcribed for data analysis. Results of this study indicated a complex relationship between <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers' conceptions of geometry and conceptions of teaching geometry. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers could not discuss their conceptions of geometry without discussing the teaching of geometry. Their conceptions about geometry and their belief that geometry was linear, in nature were so strong that these views became connected with their views of teaching geometry. Clearly, <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers' conceptions of geometry influenced their conceptions of teaching geometry and the teaching of subject matter influenced <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers' conceptions of geometry as well. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers' conceptions of geometry and their classroom practices was directly influenced by the textbooks used.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study focused on}} the development of reflective practice with preservice teachers through a framework during an early field experience. The framework provided an explicit structure for <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers to investigate four focus areas (teachers role, active learning, culture, and assessment). <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers explored a focus area, dialogued via e-mail with a peer, and then discussed their findings in small groups. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers were given a pre and post survey that queried them about their beliefs related to the four focus areas and the concept of reflection. Content analysis of the explanatory statements on the survey, dialogue e-mails and written reflections after small group discussions, and focus group interviews guided a systematic examination of the data. The dialogue e-mails and written reflections were also analyzed using a rubric for reflective levels. The survey results indicated that while a substantial number of preservice teachers maintained the same belief after experiencing the framework of inquiry into practice, an equal or greater number of preservice teachers changed. These preservice teachers became more student-focused as the semester progressed. They also became increasingly self-critical of their own teaching practices which led them to alternative approaches. Consequently, these preservice teachers were able to articulate their beliefs in the context of teaching. The structure of the framework provided opportunities for <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers to rehearse reflective practice; thus teacher educators have an explicit methodological model for developing reflective practitioners. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers indicated that the framework increased self-monitoring which facilitated analysis of their teaching...|$|E

Four female preservice practicum teachers specializing in severe disabilities participated in the study. One university supervisor implemented the supervision procedures.
