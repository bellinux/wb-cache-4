5000|$|Truman's disinclination {{to delay}} the second bombing brings the Soviet factor back into consideration. What the {{destruction}} of Nagasaki accomplished was Japan's immediate surrender, and for Truman this swift capitulation was crucial in order to preempt a Soviet military move into Asia. ... In short, the first bomb was dropped {{as soon as it}} was ready, and for the reason the administration expressed: to hasten the end of the Pacific War. But in the case of the second bomb, <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> <b>everything.</b> In an important sense, the destruction of Nagasaki—not the bombing itself but Truman's refusal to delay it—was America's first act of the Cold War.|$|R

50|$|Actor Dick Miller {{was unhappy}} with the film's low {{production}} values. Miller is quoted by Beverly Gray as stating that,If they'd had more money to put into the production so we didn't have to use mannequins for the statues; if we didn't have to shoot the last scene with me hanging with just some gray make-up on because they didn't have time to put the plaster on me, {{this could have been}} a very classic little film.

5000|$|Braceros met the {{challenges}} of discrimination and exploitation by finding various {{ways in which they}} could resist and attempt to improve their living conditions and wages in the Pacific Northwest work camps. Over two dozen strikes were held {{in the first two years}} of the program. One common method used to increase their wages was by “loading sacks” which consisted of braceros loading their harvest bags with rock in order to make their harvest heavier and therefore be paid more for the sack. [...] Also Braceros learned that <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> <b>everything.</b> Strikes <b>were</b> more successful when combined with work stoppages, cold weather, and a pressing harvest period. [...] The notable strikes throughout the Northwest proved that employers would rather negotiate with Braceros than to deport them, employers had little time to waste as their crops needed to be harvested and the difficulty and expense associated with the Bracero program forced them to negotiate with Braceros for fair wages and better living conditions. [...] Braceros were also discriminated and segregated in the labor camps. Some growers went to the extent of building three labor camps, one for whites, one for blacks, and the one for Mexicans. The living conditions were horrible, unsanitary, and poor. One example of this is in 1943 Grants Pass, Oregon 500 braceros were food poisoned which was one of the most severe cases of food poisoning reported in the Northwest. 300 of them required hospitalization. This detrition of the quality and quantity of food persisted into 1945 until the Mexican government intervened. [...] Lack of food, poor living conditions, discrimination, and exploitation led Braceros to become active in strikes and to successfully negotiate their terms.|$|R

[...] — Cyrus discussing the transition she experienced during the production of The Time of Our Lives. In order to support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold exclusively by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect for that kind of look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely want to be able to step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|R

His boyhood years haunted him in later life, crime {{to him as a}} boy was his only escape from poverty and abuse, he was fast and the only time his family paid him the slightest attention was when he brought stolen money home to them. He became obsessed with <b>timing.</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> timed and re-timed including crime which made him the perfect criminal, with an OCD attention to minute detail. During the Eastcastle St. robbery he timed the distances and mail delivery vans over many days and when questioned by police while he was watching the street, {{he said that he was}} a film producer, locating good areas for a gangster film.

40|$|At a {{young age}} I had my voice taken from me. For as long as I could remember, playing pretend for me {{was not just a}} fun childish game but rather a vital {{component}} in my development of discovering my voice, as well as myself. From the moment I could speak I found that doing impersonations of other people, or creating characters myself helped me achieve fluency with my speech. Growing up with such a wild imagination, I desperately needed to learn how to control all the creative impulses I had. Specificity, and precision became the goal from the moment I walked into grad school. I have had the great fortune to tell the stories of characters such as Wife, who taught me the meaning of love, and what sacrifice is. Stacey, who challenged me to take more risk than I ever had before. Goldie, who taught me that <b>timing</b> and precision <b>were</b> <b>everything.</b> From Katherine, to Lady M, to Juliet all of who took me on a journey to another time, by teaching me how to blend my eccentricities to their worlds. This program has given me the tools necessary to be an artist who doesn't just run on impulse. In these three years I have been encouraged to bring my wild imagination to the table, my voice, and spontaneity with precision and specificity...|$|R

30|$|Time is {{invariably}} also {{a concept}} of politics in theory - there <b>is</b> <b>timing</b> in <b>everything.</b> Its understanding <b>is</b> subject to the “zeitgeist” – or more precisely, to the mutable social construction of reality. Indicators of a transformation are currently claimed by two sides: {{on the one hand}} by the natural sciences, particularly in view of advances in the physical concept of the world. In his semantic analysis of the concept of time the sociologist Niklas Luhmann, for example, explicitly refers to advances in knowledge that were only made possible by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. 3 On the other hand, the topic is also treated under the aspect of subject philosophy, which focuses on descriptions of both subjective and individual-psychologically coloured sensation, which {{goes hand in hand with}} a new understanding of time. These phenomenologies of lament are centred around temporal stress, hectic activity over a prolonged period, haste or tiredness, excessive demands due to acceleration processes, overburden and increasingly prevalent pathological conditions such as depression and burnout, the cause of which is at least in part attributed to a change in quality of time that is yet to be mastered. With a view to our methodical interest, in the following we shall concentrate on the first strand.|$|R
