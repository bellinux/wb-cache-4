To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E

In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E

NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, although none as pilots. After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality would fly in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya.

5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia.

Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E

5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. <b>The</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage.

However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. <b>The</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|Luffa gained King Henry's respect because Luffa was {{the lone}} bishop to resist Henry's {{financial}} extortion from the clergy. As part of this dispute, Luffa ordered that all church services be discontinued and the church doors in his diocese be blocked with thorns. It was during Luffa's tenure of the see that the first disputes between the bishop and Battle Abbey started, although they were not large. During Luffa's episcopate, he and the abbey disputed over {{the right of the}} bishop to be entertained by the abbey and <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>that</b> the abbot attend the diocesan councils. The dispute only reached its climax during the episcopate of Hilary of Chichester, who was Bishop of Chichester from 1147 to 1169. Luffa also supported Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy over the Archbishop of York in 1108 and 1109.|$|E

However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children {{would not be able to}} get into the better schools.|$|E
