50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is <b>the</b> <b>Thrust</b> <b>Bearing,</b> which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). <b>The</b> <b>Thrust</b> <b>Bearing</b> is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{burnishing}} is {{a method}} of cold working metal surfaces to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} roller burnishing a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the burnishing tool is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces.

The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style tilt pad bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in <b>the</b> journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>The</b> parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> are discussed. <b>The</b> new <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry <b>the</b> design <b>thrust</b> load with fewer pads.

Most pump and motor manufacturers caution users to not operate the vertical turbine pumps at conditions that result in ?upthrust. ? upthrust conditions are usually encountered {{for a few seconds}} each time the pump is started; however, the pump should not be operate for periods longer than a few seconds in this condition. Due to lack of instrumentation on the pumps, {{it is often difficult to}} determine if the pump is operating in an upthrust condition.

A review of the relevant literature revealed a significant lack of information concerning the operating properties of a lightly loaded, water lubricated marine bearing.

A number of analytical and numerical models for predicting critical speeds were investigated. Geometric modifications {{were made to the}} test rig and the changes in critical speeds were observed. The ability of the predictive models to measure these observed critical speeds was examined. Driveline mass and driveline overhang were found to have the most significant effects on critical speeds. Modifications to <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> housing, the impeller mass, the tailpipe stiffness and the marine bearing resulted in no significant shift in critical speeds.
