40|$|An empirically based {{fuzzy logic}} microphysical {{classification}} scheme is described using C-band polarimetric radar measurements. Polarimetric power and differential phase measurements in both radial and cartesian space are employed to define membership functions in two-dimensional subspaces and are then {{coupled with a}} temperature-dependent membership function to classify scattering hydrometeors into one of ten species. Examples of this approach are presented for a tropical <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>observed</b> near Darwin, Australia and for a subtropical severe <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>observed</b> near Sydney, Australia.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{lightning}} NOx (NO 1 NO 2) {{production on}} the cloud scale is key for developing better parameterizations of lightning NOx {{for use in}} regional and global chemical transport models. This paper attempts to further the understanding of lightning NOx production on the cloud scale using a cloud model simulation of an <b>observed</b> <b>thunderstorm.</b> Objectives are (1) to infer from the model simulations and in situ measurements the relative production rates of NOx by cloud-to-ground (CG) and intracloud (IC) lightning for the storm; (2) to assess the relative contributions in the storm anvil of convective transport of NOx from the boundary layer and NOx production by lightning; and (3) to simulate {{the effects of the}} lightning-generated NOx on subsequent photochemical ozone production. We use a two-dimensional cloud model that includes a parameterized source of lightning-generated NOx to study the production and advection of NOx associated with a developing northeast Colorado <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>observed</b> on July 12, 1996, during the Stratosphere-Troposphere Experiment—Radiation, Aerosols, Ozone (STERAO-A) field campaign.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} campaign to investigate Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) over South America, coordinated optical, ELF/VLF, and lightning measurements were made of a mesoscale <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>observed</b> on February 22 – 23, 2006 over northern Argentina that produced 445 TLEs within a 6 hour period. Here, we report comprehensive measurements {{of one of these}} events, a sprite with halo that was unambiguously associated with a large negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning discharge with an impulsive vertical charge moment change (DMQv) of 03 C. km. This event was similar in its location, morphology and duration to other positive TLEs observed from this storm. However, the downward extent of the negative streamers was limited to 25 km, and their apparent brightness was lower than that of a comparable positive event. Observations of negative CG events are rare, and these measurements provide further evidence that sprites can be driven by upward as well as downward electric fields, as predicted by the conventional breakdown mechanism...|$|R

The characteristics of the cases are examined and related to the upper-level temperature and wind conditions. It is found that the warm points downwind of the cloud top are due to subsidence. The anaylsis suggests the presence of subsidence due to mountainlike waves. A model in which the close-in warm point is produced by both internal cloud air motions and stratospheric flow around and over the cloud top. It is suggested that the distant warm point is due to either a wave perturbation from air flowing over the cloud top, or air flowing horizonatlly around the elevated portion of the cloud top and anvil...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of thunderstorms in southern Germany was investigated. The <b>thunderstorms</b> were <b>observed</b> by a lightning position system {{during the summer}} months of the years 1992 to 1996. On average every second day <b>thunderstorms</b> were <b>observed</b> anywhere in southern Germany. In general thunderstorms approach from westerly and south-westerly directions. The average speed is 13 m/s. No significant relation between the occurrence of thunderstorms and the large scale synoptic pattern described by the Grosswetterlagen (large scale weather pattern) was found. <b>Thunderstorms</b> were <b>observed</b> during almost all Grosswetterlagen. The reduction to 8 weather pattern based on the low-level flow in southern Germany showed that thunderstorms are likely when the flow has westerly directions (43 %) or easterly directions (20 %). Three distinct groups of different lightning patterns could be identified; stationary, moving thunderstorms and thunderstorm lines. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the wind shear were retrieved from the radio soundings from Muenchen and Stuttgart. On average CAPE was 583 J/kg for stationary, 701 J/kg for moving thunderstorms, and 876 J/kg for thunderstorm lines. The average bulk Richardson numbers are 152, 80 and 52 for stationary, moving thunderstorms and thunderstorm lines, respectively. The steering level was found to be at about 3 and 6 km m. s. l. However, it should be noted, that in most cases the soundings do not completely describe the local environment of thunderstorms, since radio soundings are only available twice a day. (orig.)
