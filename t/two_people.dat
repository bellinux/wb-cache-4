5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if <b>two</b> <b>people</b> conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim.

5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed <b>two</b> <b>people.</b> Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings.

Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. <b>Two</b> <b>people</b> died after their boat sank off Staten Island.
