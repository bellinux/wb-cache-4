40|$|The {{conditioning}} of fear {{responses to}} a simple acoustic stimulus (pure tone) paired with footshock can be mediated by the transmission of auditory information to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala from either the auditory thalamus or the auditory cortex. We examined the processing capacity of the <b>thalamo-amygdala</b> <b>pathway</b> by making lesions of the auditory cortex and testing {{the extent to which}} conditioned fear responses generalized to tones other than the one paired with footshock. Two studies were performed, one in an anatomically constrained computational model of the fear conditioning network and the other in rats. Stimulus generalization was unaffected in both. These findings support the validity of the model as an approach to studying the neural basis of conditioned fear learning, and in addition suggest that the <b>thalamo-amygdala</b> <b>pathway,</b> possibly by the use of population coding, is capable of performing at least crude stimulu...|$|E
40|$|Neuroligin- 1 is {{a potent}} trigger for the de novo {{formation}} of synaptic connections, and it has recently been suggested that it {{is required for the}} maturation of functionally competent excitatory synapses. Despite evidence for the role of neuroligin- 1 in specifying excitatory synapses, the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences that neuroligin- 1 may have at mature synapses of normal adult animals remain unknown. By silencing endogenous neuroligin- 1 acutely in the amygdala of live behaving animals, we have found that neuroligin- 1 is required for the storage of associative fear memory. Subsequent cellular physiological studies showed that suppression of neuroligin- 1 reduces NMDA receptor-mediated currents and prevents the expression of long-term potentiation without affecting basal synaptic connectivity at the <b>thalamo-amygdala</b> <b>pathway.</b> These results indicate that persistent expression of neuroligin- 1 is required for the maintenance of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, which enables normal development of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in the amygdala of adult animals...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{amygdala}} (LA) {{is thought}} to be critical for the specific acquisition of conditioned fear, and the emotionally charged memories related to fear are thought to require a form of synaptic plasticity related to long-term potentiation (LTP). Is LTP in the lateral amygdala enduring, and, if so, does it require gene expression and the synthesis of new protein? Using brain slices, we have examined the molecular-signaling pathway of LTP in the cortico-amygdala and the <b>thalamo-amygdala</b> <b>pathways.</b> We find that a single high-frequency train of stimuli induces a transient LTP (E-LTP); by contrast, five repeated high-frequency trains induce an enduring late phase of LTP (L-LTP), which is dependent on gene expression and on new protein synthesis. In both pathways the late phase of LTP is mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
