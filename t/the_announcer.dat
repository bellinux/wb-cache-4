40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the borrowing of some English words which {{is done by}} <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> during <b>the</b> presentation of some Entertainment Programmes in EBS Fm Radio Station. Using a tape recorder and a diary, the writer recorded the conversation of <b>the</b> five <b>announcers</b> while they were presenting some programme, then classified <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> based on <b>the</b> programmes that they handled. After that the English borrowed words were underlined and analyzed one by one. The data analyzed was divided based on the kinds of programmes; entertainment programme and entertainment information. It {{was found that the}} words which were often borrowed by <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> were <b>the</b> English words which are familiar for them such as : single,request, on time, session, guys and gals, stay tune, one o one point twenty five, etc. Those words were said by <b>the</b> five <b>announcers</b> almost all <b>the</b> time and it seems it has become a commitment for them in presenting some programmes. The main reason that made <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> under study borrowed some English words is their habit in speaking English in their school and in their office which unconciously made them borrow some English words. Besides, there was another factor that made <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> borrow some English words, that is the condition of <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> who are bilingual. In one side, they have to use Indonesian in presenting radio programmes and in the other side there is a demand to be able to speak English for Fm Radio Station's announcers. That demand made them use some English words immediately. This study only {{analyzed the}} English words which were often borrowed by <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> and analyzed <b>the</b> factors that made <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> borrow some English words in presenting some Indonesian Programmes in Radio Station. There are many shortcomings in terms of scope, instruments and technique of data analysis. Therefore it is suggested : a. Future Research of borrowing could be emphasised on other languages beside English, and on different object of study such as : borrowing some Javanese words in Indonesian or borrowing some Chinese words in Indonesian,etc. b. In borrowing the English. words <b>the</b> <b>announcers</b> should be able to combine those English words into Indonesian in good terms...|$|R

5|$|Charlie O'Donnell was the program's {{first and}} longest tenured announcer. In 1980, NBC was {{discussing}} cancelling Wheel and O'Donnell {{agreed to take}} the position as announcer on The Toni Tennille Show. The network decided against the cancellation but O'Donnell decided to honor his commitment and left the series. His replacement was Jack Clark, who added the syndicated series to his responsibilities when it premiered in 1983 and announced for both series {{until his death in}} July 1988. Los Angeles radio personality M. G. Kelly was Clark's replacement, starting on the daytime series in August 1988 and on the syndicated series when its new season launched a month later. Kelly held these positions until O'Donnell was able to return to <b>the</b> <b>announcer</b> position, doing so after his duties with Barris Industries came to an end {{at the end of the}} 1988–89 television season. O'Donnell remained with the series until shortly before his death in November 2010. Don Pardo, Don Morrow, and Johnny Gilbert have occasionally served as substitute announcers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by <b>the</b> <b>announcer</b> if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E
