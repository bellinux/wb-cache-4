This instrument {{consists of a}} monocular indirect ophthalmoscopic delivery system, a beam control box, a standard slit-lamp delivery system and a <b>changeover</b> <b>switch.</b> The characteristics of this photocoagulator are as follows: a easier application, better viewing of whole fundus during retinal photocoagulation, effective photocoagulation in supine position, posibility to change direct photocoagulator or indirect one by the <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> and photocoagulation viewed from all directions around the patient head. After confirming the condition and safety by experimenting on rabbits eyes, laser photo coagulation is to be performed on diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear, branch occlusion of retinal vein, retinal neovascularization, retinal macroaneurysm and retinopathy of prematurity. Especially this monocular indirect argon laser photocoagulation can be applied more effectively than xenon light coagulation on the retinopathy of prematurity thanks to overall view of the fundus in supine position. While {{on the other hand}} it has two unfavorable points, i. e. it is unstable to be fixed and that fine and delicate laser photocoagulation in the mascular area cannot be performed.

50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs <b>changeover</b> <b>switches</b> or an H bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe Drosophila sex {{pheromone}} cVA elicits different {{behaviors in}} males and females. First- and second-order olfactory neurons show identical pheromone responses, suggesting that sex genes differentially wire circuits {{deeper in the}} brain. Using inÂ vivo whole-cell electrophysiology, we now show that two clusters of third-order olfactory neurons have dimorphic pheromone responses. One cluster responds in females; the other responds in males. These clusters are present in both sexes and share a common input pathway, but sex-specific wiring reroutes pheromone information. Regulating dendritic position, the fruitless transcription factor both connects the male-responsive cluster and disconnects the female-responsive cluster from pheromone input. Selective masculinization of third-order neurons transforms their morphology and pheromone responses, demonstrating that circuits can be functionally rewired by the cell-autonomous action of a switch gene. This bidirectional switch, analogous to an electrical <b>changeover</b> <b>switch,</b> provides a simple circuit logic to activate different behaviors in males and females...|$|R

40|$|Gasoline {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} products in an oil refinery and can account for as much as 60 - 70 % of total profit. Optimal integrated scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations can significantly increase profit by avoiding ship demurrage, improving customer satisfaction, minimizing quality give-aways, reducing costly transitions and slop generation, exploiting low-quality cuts, and reducing inventory costs. In this article, we first introduce a new unit-specific event-based continuous-time formulation for the integrated treatment of recipes, blending, and scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations. Many operational features are included such as nonidentical parallel blenders, constant blending rate, minimum blend length and amount, blender transition times, multipurpose product <b>tanks,</b> <b>changeovers,</b> and piecewise constant profiles for blend component qualities and feed rates. To address the non-convexities arising from forcing constant blending rates during a run, we propose a hybrid global optimization approach incorporating a schedule adjustment procedure, iteratively via a mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming scheme, and a rigorous deterministic global optimization approach. The computational results demonstrate that our proposed formulation does improve the mixed-integer linear programming relaxation of Li and Karimi, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2011, 50, 9156 - 9174. All examples are solved to be 1 %-global optimality with modest computational effort. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineer...|$|R
40|$|Summary Cells {{exposed to}} ER-stress undergo the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to avoid apoptosis, {{but may also}} {{activate}} autophagy. However, the signal for selection {{of one of these}} two protective responses is unknown. To clarify the key switch between autophagy and apoptosis, we examined the correlation of UPR-related signals with autophagy and/or apoptosis inductions in HepG 2 cells exposed to three ER-stress inducers (NaF, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin) with time, including the effect of small interfering RNA on the cell responses. Thapsigargin-induced ER-stress caused only apoptosis after â¼ 2 âhr with Ire 1 phosphorylation, and Grp 78, ATF 4, and CHOP expressions. On the other hand, NaF- and tunicamycin-induced ER-stress caused only autophagy in the early stage by â¼ 8 âhr with ATF 4 expression and without CHOP expression. ATF 4 -siRNA completely inhibited the autophagy induced by NaF or tunicamycin with suppressed ATF 4 protein and mRNA expressions, and also inhibited apoptosis by thapsigargin with suppression of both ATF 4 and CHOP. CHOP-siRNA had no effect on autophagy activation by NaF and tunicamycin. On the other hand, CHOP-siRNA activated autophagy in thapsigargin-induced ER-stress with significant ATF 4 expression, and suppressed apoptosis with CHOP suppression. These results showed that ATF 4 is the key signal for autophagy induced by ER-stress, and that autophagy is switched to apoptosis by subsequent CHOP upregulation, suggesting that the <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> between autophagy and apoptosis is located between ATF 4 to CHOP in the PERK pathway...|$|R
50|$|Argon can be {{purchased}} for use with the ICP-MS in either a refrigerated liquid or a gas form. However {{it is important to}} note that whichever form of argon purchased, it should have a guaranteed purity of 99.9% Argon at a minimum. It is important to determine which type of argon will be best suited for the specific situation. Liquid argon is typically cheaper and can be stored in a greater quantity as opposed to the gas form, which is more expensive and takes up more tank space. If the instrument is in an environment where it gets infrequent use, then buying argon in the gas state will be most appropriate as it will be more than enough to suit smaller run times and gas in the cylinder will remain stable for longer periods of time, whereas liquid argon will suffer loss to the environment due to venting of the tank when stored over extended time frames. However, if the ICP-MS is to be used routinely and is on and running for eight or more hours each day for several days a week, then going with liquid argon will be the most suitable. If there are to be multiple ICP-MS instruments running for long periods of time, then it will most likely be beneficial for the laboratory to install a bulk or micro bulk argon tank which will be maintained by a gas supply company, thus eliminating the need to change out tanks frequently as well as minimizing loss of argon that is left over in each used tank as well as down time for <b>tank</b> <b>changeover.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to understand that these advantages are more applicable to the decision between using a batch, a semibatch or a continuous reactor in a certain process. Both batch and semibatch reactors are more suitable for liquid phase reactions and small scale production, because they usually require lower capital costs than a continuously stirred tank reactor operation (CSTR), but incur greater costs per unit if production needs to be scaled up. These per unit costs include labor, materials handling (filling, emptying, cleaning), protective measures, and nonproductive periods that result from <b>changeovers</b> when <b>switching</b> batches. Hence, the capital costs must be weighed against operating costs to determine the correct reactor design to be implemented.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|R

40|$|Lever {{pressing}} by 2 squirrel monkeys {{was maintained}} under fixed-interval 6 -min and fixed-interval 2 -min schedules of electric-shock presentation. Preference for these schedules was assessed during three experimental phases. In all phases, responses on one lever produced shock {{according to one}} or the other fixed-interval schedule, and responses on a second, <b>changeover,</b> lever <b>switched</b> between schedules. The opportunity to change over was presented during separate choice periods (during which the fixed-interval schedules did not operate) that followed the first through fourth shocks in each schedule. If no changeover occurred during those choice periods, a changeover automatically occurred following the fifth shock. In Phase I, durations of the choice periods were fixed. In Phase II, the choice periods equaled a proportion of their respective fixed interval. During Phase III (completed with 1 monkey) a response on the changeover lever during a given choice period reinstated the most recent fixed interval, and a failure to respond resulted in a changeover. During each of these phases, distinct preferences developed for the 6 -min schedule. These results suggest that the maintenance of lever pressing by fixed-interval presentation of electric shock may not be an example of positive reinforcement, and that the response-maintaining characteristics of shock presentation may derive from other properties of the schedule...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a speed sensorless variable structure direct-torque-controlled interior permanent magnet synchronous motor drive at very low speeds including standstill is investigated in this paper. The rotor position and speed are estimated using a high-frequency (HF) signal injection algorithm at low speeds and a sliding observer at medium to high speeds. The changeover between these two algorithms is performed using a weighting function which smoothly hands over the estimated rotor position information for stator flux and torque estimation purposes. Experiments were performed to test {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed HF signal injection algorithm, and results show that the sensorless drive is capable of accurately estimating the position and speed at very low speeds including standstill.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the failure to maximize reinforcement on concurrent variable-interval, variable-ratio schedules may be misleading. Inasmuch as response costs are not directly measured, it is possible that subjects are optimally balancing the benefits of reinforcement against the costs of responding. To evaluate this hypothesis, pigeons were tested in a procedure in which interval and ratio schedules had equal response costs. On a concurrent variable time (VT), variable ratio-time (VRT) schedule, the VT schedule runs throughout the session and the VRT schedule is controlled by responses to a <b>changeover</b> key that <b>switches</b> from one schedule to the other. Reinforcement is presented independent of response. This schedule retains the essential features of concurrent VI VR, but eliminates differential response costs for the two alternatives. It therefore also eliminates at least one significant ambiguity about the reinforcement maximizing performance. Pigeons did not maximize rate of reinforcement on this procedure. Instead, their times spent on the alternative schedules matched the relative rates of reinforcement, even when schedule parameters were such that matching earned the lowest possible overall rate of reinforcement. It was further shown that the observed matching was not a procedural artifact arising from the constraints built into the schedule...|$|R

The equipment selection problem {{might be involved}} with choosing between large-capacity machines versus {{a greater number of}} machines with smaller capacities, and/or dedicated facilities versus multi-product facilities. This paper investigates reconfigurable machining system characteristics in order to identify the crucial factors influencing the machine selection and the machine (re) configuration. Furthermore, changeover cost and <b>changeover</b> time while <b>switching</b> from one product to the other are taken into account. In particular, a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) model is proposed to integrate the decisive factors for the equipment selection process under uncertainty. The expected values of the normalised fuzzy sets are determined to identify the preference values of the alternative machines. The fuzzy multi-criteria model is analysed within the fuzzy domains of the operational characteristics along with economic, quality and performance criteria. The proposed model is examined using monitoring sensitivity analysis through a case study. As a result, the alternative machines are prioritised with consideration of the inconsistency ratios. The relative performances of the alternative equipment in view of interactions of process reconfigurability and cost, and capacity and functionality are graphically illustrated.

40|$|In a multi-product, discrete-item {{manufacturing}} environment, it {{is often}} more economical to have one flexible machine to produce the products than to have a dedicated machine {{for the production of}} each product. In the flexible-machine environment, it becomes necessary to produce one product, changeover the facility to another product to produce it, and so on. In this thesis, we focus on this changeover. ^ Each product will likely have a unique machine setup [...] or machine configuration [...] associated with it. A <b>changeover</b> is the <b>switching</b> of the machine configuration from one setup to another. In almost all cases, the changeover will be costly, and thus, it is an activity which must be managed. Managing this type of activity requires a plan of how much of a product to produce after a changeover and in what order to make the changeovers to various products. Such a plan is referred to as a schedule. ^ In this thesis we look at how the batching and scheduling decision is made for a single machine in a dynamic, deterministic demand environment. Managers of many firms try to avoid late shipments at almost any cost, implying a very high backorder cost; thus we assume all demand must be met on time (if possible). Although we assume demand is deterministic, we also assume demand is known only for a finite time horizon. We assume that the only 2 Ì 2 relevant costs 2 Ì 2 are the cost of the changeover. We consider both the case of negligible and non-negligible changeover times. ^ In this thesis, we develop procedures to optimally solve the changeover scheduling problem, as we refer to the problem described above. We develop results for the problem for sequence-independent changeover costs for two cases of changeover times: (1) when non-negligible, positive changeover times exist and (2) when they are negligible. We provide results for obtaining lower bounds on the optimal solution. We develop a forward-time implicit-enumeration algorithm to optimally solve the problem {{as an alternative to the}} backward-time approaches and because the backward-time approaches presented thus far do not look very promising when changeover times are present. In addition, not only are forward-time scheduling methods generally more intuitive, but forecast horizon results are readily obtained from forward-time algorithms. We present such results in this thesis. ...|$|R
