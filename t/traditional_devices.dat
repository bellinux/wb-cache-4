2500|$|The {{election}} campaign took place from late March until 20 April, employing {{a mix of}} <b>traditional</b> <b>devices</b> and concepts inspired by {{election campaign}}s in the West. These largely involved the use of posters, flags bearing the Croatian chequy arms, graffiti, badges, stickers, support from entertainers and media, {{and the use of}} political rallies. Parties also relied on word of mouth, media manipulation and even paranoia. An overall lack of political experience led to the use of some awkward, distasteful or otherwise poor slogans and posters. SKH-SDP posters were largely devoted to Račan and his messages: [...] "We stopped single-mindedness, achieved democracy, Croatia freely elects" [...] and [...] "Račan's NO to single-mindedness". The HDZ used simple messages: [...] "One knows – HDZ" [...] and [...] "HDZ – our name is our agenda", [...] while the KNS used an image of a chessboard with the word Koalicija (Coalition) inscribed in its fields. In the initial stages of the campaign, the SDP-SKH was generally expected to win; The Economist predicted a coalition government would be formed.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} symptom of LED (and diode laser) failure is the gradual {{lowering}} of light output {{and loss of}} efficiency. Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of high-power LEDs, the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than <b>traditional</b> <b>devices.</b> This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantify useful lifetime in a standardized manner, some suggest using L70 or L50, which are runtimes (typically in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>traditional</b> <b>devices</b> used to {{minimize}} or prevent cribbing and wind-sucking. However, the effectiveness of these methods is arguable since they do not address the underlying causal factors. One method involves the horse wearing a collar-like device that stops a horse from arching and swelling its neck to suck in air. However, one of the only studies of the equipment showed that although wearing such a collar for 24 hours reduced cribbing in six of eight horses, once the collar was removed, cribbing returned to greater levels than before. The authors concluded cribbing has a function and that preventing this by using anti-cribbing collars may compromise the horse's welfare.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} authentically portray the hardships and poverty of Roman {{people under the}} occupation, Rossellini hired mostly non-professional actors for the film, with some {{exceptions}} of established stars including Fabrizi and Anna Magnani. On {{the making of the}} film, Rossellini stated that the [...] "situation of the moment guided by my own and the actors' moods and perspectives" [...] dictated what they shot, and he relied more on improvisation than on a script. He also stated that the film was [...] "a film about fear, the fear felt by all of us but by me in particular. I too had to go into hiding. I too was on the run. I had friends who were captured and killed." [...] Rossellini relied on <b>traditional</b> <b>devices</b> of melodrama, such as identification of the film's central characters and a clear distinction between good and evil characters. Four interior sets were constructed for the most important locations of the film.|$|E

50|$|Safety back-up device, this is {{the most}} {{important}} tool as it a provides a redundancy should an ascender, descender, working rope or anchor fail. It is attached to the safety (second rope) and designed to be kept as high as possible to reduce the distance fallen in the event of a fall. The safety devices usually relies on friction transferred to the safety rope by means of a cam. The Petzl Shunt, a recreational climbing device, has been used successfully for many years for the safety back-up because it is positionable by the user, allowing it to be high above them at the work site and thus providing optimum protection. Concern over potential misuse and lack of user instructions or support for its use by Petzl has led to the development of other devices, including the Petzl ASAP, the KONG Back-Up, the DMM Buddy Catch, the SafeTec Duck-R. Unlike <b>traditional</b> <b>devices</b> that rely on friction to absorb shock the ASAP relies on a toothed wheel and an rip-stitch single use shock pack and although has the advantage of self trailing it tends to creep below the user. The Duck-R is a beefed-up stainless steel Shunt-shaped device designed specifically for use in rope access. All devices are connected back to the harness by means of a lanyard, otherwise known as a cow's tail, and fastened to the lanyard by a screwgate carabiner.|$|E
