5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US {{aircraft}} to enter North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent {{aircraft to}} scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division parked on the tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The aircraft was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2011–12 season, Maribor played in the 2011 Slovenian Supercup against Domžale on 8 July 2012 and lost with the score 2–1 after regulation. This was the second consecutive loss for Maribor against Domžale in domestic cup finals in five weeks, after losing the Slovenian cup in May 2011. In August 2011, Maribor defeated Rangers and qualified for the group stages of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. Maribor managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> point in six matches, holding Braga to a draw at the home turf. In the same season, Maribor won their tenth league title with a record number of points (85). The league title was confirmed in the game against Triglav Kranj on 22 April 2012 with an 8–0 win. Furthermore, they won the Slovenian domestic cup on 23 May 2012 by defeating their Styrian rivals Celje after penalties, securing their seventh cup title. This was the third time that Maribor managed to win The Double and {{the first time since the}} 1998–99 season.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{appearance}} of Barber's sketches, other designs were being considered for the half dollar. In early August, artist Frank Millet proposed to the fair's Director of Decorations, Olin Warner, that Warner design the coin. Warner modeled one depicting a profile of Columbus, not based on the Lotto portrait. His reverse showed a caravel ship, symbolizing the Santa María, Columbus's flagship, above two globes representing the hemispheres, though they lacked the continental outlines. Warner's proposal was praised by artists working on their sculptures at the fairgrounds. Leech also weighed in once he returned from vacation on August 26, sending fair organizers a woodcut engraving based on the official Spanish medal for the 400th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage, and arranging with the State Department for the American Embassy in Madrid <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one.</b> A medal was duly obtained and was subsequently placed in the Mint's collection.|$|E

5|$|The Peninsular War was not {{developing}} favourably for Spain, and by May 1810 a ship {{arrived with}} {{the news of the}} defeat of Seville and the disbanding of the Junta of Seville. Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros, many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority. Cisneros tried to conceal the news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship, but Belgrano and Castelli managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one.</b> Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public. Belgrano {{and the members of the}} Carlotist party, despite having given up their original idea, plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta. Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra, they waited for the news of the defeat in Spain to take action.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopter}} and boat chase scenes {{were not in}} the original novel but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by the crop-dusting scene in Hitchcock's North by Northwest and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, The Red Beret. These two scenes would initially be shot in Istanbul but were moved to Scotland. The speed-boats could not run fast enough due to the many waves in the sea, and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus. A helicopter was also hard to obtain, and the special effects crew were nearly arrested trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> at a local air base. The helicopter chase was filmed with a radio controlled miniature helicopter. The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post-production since the boats were not loud enough, and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of control, burning Walter Gotell's eyelids and seriously injuring three stuntmen.|$|E

Indeed, many hitpaʕel verbs are reflexive counterparts to other verbs with the same root; for example, הִתְרַחֵץ [...] (to wash oneself) is the reflexive of רָחַץ [...] (to wash, transitive), and הִתְגַּלֵּחַ [...] (to shave oneself, i.e. to shave, intransitive) is the reflexive of גִּלֵּחַ [...] (to shave, transitive). Some hitpaʕel verbs are a combination of causative and reflexive; for example,הִסְתַּפֵּר [...] (<b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ones</b> hair cut) is the causative reflexive of סִפֵּר [...] (to cut (hair)), and הִצְטַלֵּם [...] (<b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ones</b> picture taken) is the causative reflexive of צִלֵּם [...] (to take a picture (of someone or something)).|$|R

In the end, true knowledge is not achieved by any individual alone, but by a free exchange of thoughts with others.

25|$|After {{driving to}} midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz {{for the next}} play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked {{the ball out of}} Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> step ahead of Simpson, make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson face down on the turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by {{recording}} his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E

The wreck also ended Kenseth's streak of 13 consecutive Top 15's this season. At Watkins Glen, Kenseth while running 7th during a red flag period, saw a shirtless fan run up to his car and request an autograph to his white baseball cap. Kenseth politely declined and security escorted the fan out of the track. Kenseth later expressed regret for not signing the cap.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 2007, {{shortly after}} the start of the 2007–08 season, the Kings and Brown agreed to a six-year, $19.05million {{contract}} extension that ran through the 2013–14 season. The contract was signed a full year before Brown hit restricted free agency, partially because young forwards Dustin Penner of the Anaheim Ducks and Thomas Vanek of the Buffalo Sabres had just received lucrative offer sheets in restricted free agency, and the Kings did not want Brown <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>one.</b> Brown produced his best offensive season that year. Continuing to play top-line minutes with Kopitar, he recorded 33 goals and 60 points. To date, that season remains the only year Brown has managed to reach the 30-goal and 60-point plateaus. Despite his personal success, the rebuilding Kings missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the fifth-straight year.|$|E
