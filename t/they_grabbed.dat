25|$|In 2011, when Singapore {{revived the}} Lion City Cup, another team {{emerged from the}} shadows – the Under-15 team. The YOG side, though skipper Lightfoot was absent, played under a new coach: Takuma Koga. <b>They</b> <b>grabbed</b> second and third places (U16s – 2nd; U15s – 3rd), beating the youth sides (U15) of Juventus, Everton and Newcastle United.|$|E

On July 15, a late 89th-minute shot from Roger Levesque gave the Seattle Sounders a 1–0 victory over United. Goals from Landon Donovan and Edson Buddle of Los Angeles gave the Galaxy a 2–1 victory against United. The two losses saw United return to last place, relinquishing their brief stint in 14th and 15th place.|$|E
25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which <b>they</b> <b>grabbed</b> her by the hair, pulled her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E

2500|$|Lloyd {{says that}} the unnamed soldier was crying. [...] "It was mine," [...] he said, [...] "it was my grenade." [...] According to Lloyd, the private had failed to take the extra {{precaution}} that experienced soldiers did when <b>they</b> <b>grabbed</b> M-26 grenades from the ammo box: bend the pins, or tape them in place, so they couldn't accidentally dislodge. This soldier had a flak jacket full of grenades with treacherously straight pins, Lloyd says. [...] "He was a walking death trap." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 July 1809, {{during the}} Battle of Wagram, the light horse again led {{a charge that}} {{enhanced}} [...] their legend. In one daring attack, they smashed Duke Schwarzenberg's uhlans and prevented the whole army from being separated from {{the banks of the}} Danube River. During the melée, <b>they</b> <b>grabbed</b> the uhlans’ lances and continued their attack further with these new weapons. Most of Schwarzenberg's uhlans were Poles from Galicia. After the battle, Napoleon supposedly said: [...] "Give them these lances, if they can use them so well." [...] From this point on, they became light-horse lancers.|$|E

60|$|They slacked another rope, {{making the}} gaff sink farther down, {{after which they}} tied up about a yard of the inner bottom corner of the sail {{to the foot of}} the mast.

60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} it ended.

60|$|Now it was {{the third}} week in November, and the woods rang with the noise of pheasant-shooting. No one hunted that steep, cramped country except the village beagles, who, as often as not, escaped from their kennels and made a day of their own. Dan and Una found a couple of them towling round the kitchen-garden after the laundry cat. The little brutes were only too pleased to go rabbiting, so the {{children}} ran them all along the brook pastures and into Little Lindens farm-yard, where the old sow vanquished them--and up to the quarry-hole, where they started a fox. He headed for Far Wood, and there they frightened out all the pheasants, who were sheltering from a big beat across the valley. Then the cruel guns began again, and <b>they</b> <b>grabbed</b> the beagles lest they should stray and get hurt.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mind," [...] {{he began}} again, lifting one arm from the elbow, {{the palm of}} the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower--"Mind, {{none of us would}} feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their {{administration}} was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. <b>They</b> <b>grabbed</b> what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to...." ...|$|E
6000|$|Each black-fisher {{brought his}} own spear and torch, both {{more or less}} home-made. The spears were in many cases [...] "gully-knives," [...] {{fastened}} to staves with twine and resin, called [...] "rozet." [...] The torches were very rough-and-ready things--rope and tar, or even rotten roots dug from broken trees--in fact, anything that would flare. The black-fishers seldom journeyed far from home, confining themselves to the rivers within a radius {{of three or four}} miles. There were many reasons for this; one of them being that the hands had to be at their work on the farm by five o'clock in the morning; another, that so they poached and let poach. Except when in spate, the river I specially refer to offered no attractions to the black-fishers. Heavy rains, however, swell it much more quickly than most rivers into a turbulent rush of water; the part of it affected by the black-fishers being banked in with rocks that prevent the water's spreading. Above these rocks, again, are heavy green banks, from which stunted trees grow aslant across the river. The effect is fearsome at some points where the trees run into each other, as it were, from opposite banks. However, the black-fishers thought nothing of these things. They took a turnip lantern with them--that is, a lantern hollowed out of a turnip, with a piece of candle inside--but no lights were shown on the road. Every one knew his way to the river blindfold; so that the darker the night the better. On reaching the water there was a pause. One or two of the gang climbed the banks to discover if any bailiffs were on the watch; while the others sat down, {{and with the help of}} the turnip lantern [...] "busked" [...] their spears; in other words, fastened on the steel--or, it might be, merely pieces of rusty iron sharpened into a point at home--to the staves. Some had them busked before they set out, but that was not considered prudent; for of course there was always a risk of meeting spoil-sports on the way, to whom the spears would tell a tale that could not be learned from ordinary staves. Nevertheless little time was lost. Five or six of the gang waded into the water, torch in one hand and spear in the other; and the object now was to catch some salmon with the least possible delay, and hurry away. Windy nights were good for the sport, and I can still see the river lit up with the lumps of light that a torch makes in a high wind. The torches, of course, were used to attract the fish, which came swimming to the sheen, and were then speared. As little noise as possible was made; but though the men bit their lips instead of crying out when they missed their fish, there was a continuous ring of their weapons on the stones, and every irrepressible imprecation was echoed up and down the black glen. Two or three of the gang were told off to land the salmon, and they had to work smartly and deftly. They kept by the side of the spearsman, and the moment he struck a fish <b>they</b> <b>grabbed</b> at it with their hands. When the spear had a barb there was less chance of the fish's being lost; but often this was not the case, and probably not more than two-thirds of the salmon speared were got safely to the bank. The takes of course varied; sometimes, indeed, the black-fishers returned home empty-handed.|$|E
