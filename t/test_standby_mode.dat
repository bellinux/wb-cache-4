Electrical equipment consumes energy when on <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> Although the energy they consume is not the same as when they are switched on, putting them off when not in use can save some measure of energy. Consumers should be appropriately informed by the manufacturers of the energy electrical appliances at <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> A good way to do this is to inscribe it on a label and stick them to the appliances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{develops}} a probabilistic {{model of a}} cold standby system considering the failure of unit in <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> Initially the model contains one unit in operation and another identical in cold <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> The unit in cold <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> fails after passage of pre specified time and goes under inspection for feasibility check for maintenance or replacement, whereas the operative unit directly goes under repair at its failure. A single service facility available in the system handles the tasks of repair, inspection, maintenance or replacement. The replacement of unit in <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> at its failure, takes some time; that follows certain probability distribution. The theory of semi-Markov processes and regenerative point technique are used to develop and analyze the system model. For illustration, the results are obtained for a particular case...|$|R

40|$|A {{system of}} the subject {{invention}} includes a mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO), several base stations and mobile units. The base stations serve respective sectors or cells to establish radio communications with mobile units in their sectors or cells. The base stations {{are connected to the}} MTSO which performs switching to establish call connections between mobile units and/or between units served by an external network to which the MTSO is connected. The MTSO uses dynamic channel allocation to designate base stations to serve a call connection in active <b>mode</b> and in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> for a particular channel. Therefore, if communication with the base station serving a call connection in active mode is disrupted by a building, terrain or an equipment failure, for example, the MTSO can set the base station currently in active <b>mode</b> to <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> and can set the base station currently in <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> to active mode to serve the call connection on the channel. Thus, the use of sectors or cells in active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes,</b> allows for relatively reliable communications through macro-diversity. Also, the ping-pong effect occurs relatively infrequently because the sectors or cells are switched between active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes</b> as a mobile unit moves along a sector or cell boundary, rather than requiring a handoff to another channel as required in conventional systems. Further, through use of dynamic channel allocation, handoffs in the traditional sense are relatively rare in the {{system of the}} subject invention. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
40|$|As {{semiconductor}} technology {{goes into the}} deep submicron region, the static power caused by leakage current is no longer negligible. Gated-GND circuit technique switches SRAM cells into <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> to reduce the static power. In this paper, we studied the detailed current scenario in a Gated-GND circuit structure. Based upon the analysis, we employed a more accurate way to estimate {{the efficiency of the}} Gated-GND technique and found that the efficiency is dependant on the length of the <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> period. Thus we further proposed a time-domain constraint for using this circuit technique in higher level switchingbased power reduction algorithms. Simulation shows the <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> length should be no less than 0. 175 ms for a TSMC 180 nm technology so as to achieve significant power reduction. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{four new}} hybrid digital circuit design techniques, namely, hybrid multi-threshold CMOS {{complete}} stack technique, hybrid multi-threshold CMOS partial stack technique, hybrid super cutoff complete stack technique and hy-brid super cutoff partial stack technique, {{have been proposed}} to reduce the subthreshold leakage power dissipation in <b>standby</b> <b>modes.</b> Techniques available in literature are compared with our proposed hybrid circuit design techniques. Performance parameters such as subthreshold leakage power dissipation in active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes,</b> dynamic power dissipation and propagation delay, are compared using existing and proposed hybrid techniques for a two input AND gate. Reduction of subthreshold leakage power dissipation in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> is given more importance, {{in comparison with the}} other circuit design performance parameters. It is found that there is reduction in subthreshold leakage power dissipation in <b>standby</b> and active <b>modes</b> by 3. 5 × and 1. 15 × respectively using the proposed hybrid super cutoff com-plete stack technique as compared to the existing multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) technique. Also a saving of 2. 50 × and 1. 04 × in subthreshold leakage power dissipation in <b>standby</b> and active <b>modes</b> respectively were observed using hybrid super cutoff complete stack technique as compared to the existing super cutoff CMOS (SCCMOS) technique. The proposed hybrid super cutoff stack technique proved to perform better in terms of subthreshold leakage power dis-sipation in <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> in comparison with other techniques.
