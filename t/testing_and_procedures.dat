40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to compare {{patterns}} of downstream <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> after stress testing with imaging performed at physician offices versus at hospital-outpatient facilitiesBackgroundStress testing with imaging has grown dramatically in recent years, but whether the location of where the test is performed correlates with different patterns for subsequent cardiac <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> is unknownMethodsWe identified 82, 178 adults with private health insurance from 2005 to 2007 who underwent ambulatory myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) or stress echocardiography (SE). Subsequent MPI, SE, cardiac catheterization or revascularization within 6 months was compared between physician office and hospital outpatient settings. ResultsOverall, 85. 1 % of MPI and 84. 9 % of SE were performed in physician offices. The proportion of patients who underwent subsequent MPI, SE, or cardiac catheterization was not statistically different between physician office and hospital outpatient settings for MPI (14. 2 % vs. 13. 9 %, p = 0. 44) or SE (7. 9 % vs. 8. 6 %, p = 0. 21). However, patients with physician office imaging had slightly higher rates of repeat MPI within 6 months compared with hospital-outpatient imaging for both index MPI (3. 5 % vs. 2. 0 %, p < 0. 001) and SE (3. 4 % vs. 2. 1 %, p < 0. 001), and slightly lower rates of cardiac catheterization after index MPI (11. 4 % vs. 12. 2 %, p = 0. 04) and SE (4. 5 % vs. 7. 0 %, p < 0. 001). Differences in 6 -month utilization were observed across the 5 healthcare markets after index MPI but not after index SEConclusionsPhysician office imaging is associated with slightly higher repeat MPI and fewer cardiac catheterizations than hospital outpatient imaging, but no overall difference in the proportion of patients undergoing additional further testing or procedures. Although regional variation exists, especially for MPI, the relationship between physician office location of stress testing with imaging and greater downstream resource utilization appears modest...|$|E

40|$|When the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 {{recommended}} against universal {{breast cancer}} screening with mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years, some scientists, radiologists, politicians, and patients strongly objected. The controversy {{has been called}} the "mammography wars. " The latest chapter in these wars comes from the Swiss Medical Board, which is mandated by the Conference of Health Ministers of the Swiss Cantons, the Swiss Medical Association, and the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences to conduct health technology assessments. In a February 2014 report, the Swiss Medical Board stated that new systematic mammography screening programs should not be introduced, irrespective of the age of the women, and that existing programs should be discontinued. The board's main argument was that the absolute reduction in breast cancer mortality was low and that the adverse consequences of the screening were substantial. The absolute risk reduction in breast cancer mortality has been estimated by the board at 0. 16 % for women screened during 6. 2 years and followed-up over 13 years, {{based on the results of}} a recent Cochrane Review.

40|$|Feeding {{experiments}} comparing organically and conventionally produced {{food are}} performed {{to assess the}} overall impact on the animals' health {{as a model for}} the effects experienced by the human consumers. These experiments are based on systems research and characterized by their focus on production methods, whole food <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> in accordance with the terms of organic farming. A short review of such experiments shows that the majority of these tests revealed effects of the organically produced feed on health parameters such as reproductive performance and immune responses. Systems research is not just about simple cause-effect chains, but rather about the pluralism of interactions in biological networks; therefore, the interpretation of the outcome of whole food experiments is difficult. Furthermore, the test diets of organic and conventional origin can be constituted in different ways, compensating for or maintaining existing differences in nutrient and energy contents. The science-based results suggest positive influences from organic feeds, but there is still a need for confirmation in animals and, finally, in humans. For this purpose animal feeding trials with feed from different production systems should be conducted, with the aims to define health indicators and to establish biomarkers as a basis for future dietary intervention studies in humans. ...|$|E
40|$|Are your {{discharge}} instructions (DIs) {{leaving you}} exposed to clinical and legal risks? The right DIs can dramatically improve clinical outcomes {{and reduce the}} risk of malpractice litigation. Nowhere is the discharge process more important than in emergency and acute care medicine. Because it is often impossible to know with certainty the cause of a patient’s distress or discomfort without more extensive <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures,</b> emergency department (ED) practitioners typically discharge patients with an “initial impression, ” not a final diagnosis. In order to ensure adequate post-discharge care, therefore, the patient must receive clear DIs before they leave the ED. With high-quality DIs, patients are more likely to pursue appropriate follow-up care and be able to recognize potentially adverse changes in their conditions. Lack of appropriate patient information can result in poor patient care, more frequent readmissions to the hospital, and higher costs. In one recent study, patient comprehension of follow-up instructions upon discharge from the ED showed that 78 % of patients lacked understanding in at least one area of the instructions and 50 % did not understand two or more areas. 1 Another study showed that when patients clearly understand their post-discharge instructions, they are 30 % less likely to be readmitted to the hospital or ED within 30 days of discharge, compared to patients who have inadequate information. 2 Using In-Depth Analysis of ED Dat...|$|E

40|$|Context: Although {{cervical}} cancer {{is an unusual}} cause of death among women 65 and older, most elderly women in the US report continuing to undergo periodic Pap smear screening. Objective: To describe the incidence of Pap smears and downstream testing among elderly women. Setting: Claims-based analysis of female Medicare enrollees age 65 and older. Methods: Using three years of Medicare Part B 5 % Files (1995 – 1997), we differentiated between women undergoing screening Pap smears and those undergoing Pap smears for surveillance of previous abnormalities or Pap smear follow-up. We determined the proportion of elderly women under-going Pap smear testing and rates of downstream <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> after an initial Pap smear. Results: Four million female Medicare beneciaries over 65 years underwent Pap smear testing between 1995 and 1997, representing 25 % of the eligible population. After adjusting for underbilling for Pap smears under Medicare, 43 % of women over 65 are estimated to have undergone Pap smear testing during the 3 -year period.

40|$|Physical {{symptoms}} {{account for}} more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inad-equate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. More-over, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based ex-planation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examina-tion alone contribute 73 % to 94 % of the diagnostic information, with costly <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms im-prove in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20 % to 25 %. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treat-ments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without “normalizing ” the symptom.
