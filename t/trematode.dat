5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. <b>Trematode</b> infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory <b>trematode</b> lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E
5|$|Parasites of fishers include Baylisascaris devosi, Taenia sibirica, {{nematode}} Physaloptera sp., Alaria mustelae, <b>trematode</b> Metorchis conjunctus, nematode Trichinella spiralis and Molineus sp.|$|E
50|$|Spirorchiidae is {{a family}} of digenetic <b>trematodes.</b> Infestation by these <b>trematodes</b> leads to the disease state {{commonly}} called spirorchiidiosis. Spirorchiids are parasites of turtles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>trematodes</b> or flukes include 18,000 to 24,000 species, {{divided into}} two subclasses. Nearly all <b>trematodes</b> are parasites of mollusks and vertebrates. The smaller Aspidogastrea, {{comprising}} about 100 species, are obligate parasites of mollusks and may also infect turtles and fish, including cartilaginous fish. The Digenea, the majority of <b>trematodes,</b> are obligate parasites of both mollusks and vertebrates, but rarely occur in cartilaginous fish.|$|R
5|$|Cercaria mirabilis, a <b>trematode,</b> has an {{especially}} large larval stage (known as a cercarium) which looks {{much like a}} small crustacean or mosquito larva. It also mimics the locomotory behavior of such animals, allowing it to be eaten by predaceous fish.|$|E
5|$|Ectoparasites {{are seven}} species of mites, five ticks, five fleas, a louse, and the subdermal botfly larva, Cuterebra. Known endoparasites are three species of protozoans found in fecal smears, one <b>trematode,</b> four cestodes, seven nematodes, and nymphal pentastomids found in various {{internal}} organs.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and <b>trematode</b> flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the <b>trematode.</b>|$|E
40|$|Digenetic <b>trematodes</b> (class Trematoda) often plague pond-reared fishes. Most digenetic <b>trematodes</b> are not {{a serious}} threat to fish health; however, their mere {{presence}} often renders the fish undesirable by consumers. The black grub (Uvulifer ambloplitis), white grub (Posthodiplostomum minimum), and yellow grub (Clinostomum complanatum) are commonly seen digenetic <b>trematodes</b> in fish in earthen ponds located in the North Central Region of the United States. The purpose of this publication is to discuss the biology and prevention of these parasites, along with their effect on infected fish. Hereafter, these digenetic <b>trematodes</b> will be referred to as “grubs”...|$|R
50|$|Various lymnaeid snails, {{including}} Radix auricularia, are vectors for {{a diverse}} range of parasites, particularly <b>trematodes.</b> About 80% specimens of Radix auricularia from population near Wielkopolska National Park were found to contain <b>trematodes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of <b>trematodes</b> in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these <b>trematodes</b> include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. <b>Trematodes</b> were generally more common at the Cedar Key saltwater marsh than at the freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|R
5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the <b>trematode</b> Alaria, the {{nematodes}} Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the <b>trematode</b> (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is also a}} host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from {{parasitism}} of the common periwinkle Littorina littoria by the castrating <b>trematode</b> Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the occurrence of Eurytremaspp. in cattle by analysis of the partial 18 S rRNA gene sequence. <b>Trematodes</b> from 44 bovine pancreas were collected and classified based on typical morphological features. PCR assay and sequence analyses of amplified products confirmed that the <b>trematodes</b> classified as Eurytrema coelomaticum were phylogenetically distinct from those identified as E. pancreaticum. The {{results of this study}} represent the first molecular characterization of E. coelomaticum within the Americas, and provide an efficient method to differentiate digenean <b>trematodes</b> of domestic animals...|$|R
5000|$|Human {{infections are}} {{most common in}} Asia, Africa, Latin and South America and the Middle East. However, <b>trematodes</b> can be found {{anywhere}} where untreated human waste is used as fertilizer.Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) {{is an example of}} a parasitic disease caused by one of the species of <b>trematodes</b> (platyhelminth infection, or [...] "flukes"), a parasitic worm of the genus Schistosoma. Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola and Paragonimus species, the foodborne <b>trematodes,</b> are another. Other diseases are caused by members of the Choledocystus genus.|$|R

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth guitarfish. The ray is {{protected}} by the thorns on its head and back, and it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the <b>trematode</b> Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a bowmouth guitarfish being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus).|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the <b>trematode</b> Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one <b>trematode,</b> larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E

5|$|Up to 60 {{helminth}} {{species are}} known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria plica infect the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.multilocularis. Eleven <b>trematode</b> species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the <b>trematode</b> Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} <b>trematode</b> {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E

5000|$|Digenean <b>trematodes</b> {{have been}} cultured in various, complex, media. However, their {{parasitic}} stages die soon in water. Aspidogastreans may survive for many days or even weeks outside a host in simple physiological saline solution). For example, adult A. conchicola survived {{in water for}} a fortnight, and {{in a mixture of}} water and saline solution for up to five weeks. L. manteri extracted from fish could be kept alive for up to 13 days in dilute sea water in which they laid eggs containing larvae infective to snails. This has led to the suggestions that aspidogastreans are archaic <b>trematodes,</b> not yet well adapted to specific hosts, which have given rise to the more [...] "advanced" [...] digenean <b>trematodes,</b> and that the complex life cycles of digenean <b>trematodes</b> have evolved from the simple ones of aspidogastreans.|$|R
