5000|$|Material {{is put on}} a sinter {{machine in}} two layers. The bottom layer may vary in {{thickness}} from 30 to 75 mm. A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, {{also referred to as}} the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of 350 to 660 mm. The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine [...] The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked {{from the bottom of the}} bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several <b>temperature</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( [...] 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{very often}} IR-thermography {{is used to}} analyze the {{temperature}} on electronic device surfaces. To measure the absolute surface temperature correctly, the IR-camera detector has to be calibrated with a corresponding evaluation software using a black body calibration device. Commercially available black radiators are heavyweight and a calibration of macrolenses is not possible due to mismatch of the macro lens diameter and the structural design of the radiator. This paper describes the design and realization of a mobile, miniaturized black body calibration device (mass 500 g) which supports macro lenses as well. To realize a temperature range of - 5 °C to 130 °C, a Peltier element as cooling source and a flip-chip mounted thermal test die (TTD) as black radiator heat source, with an including <b>temperature</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument,</b> were used.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of temperature measurement systems, continuous temperature profiles {{can be obtained}} with high precision. Small temperature changes can be detected by modern <b>temperature</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensor (DTS) in intelligent completions and will potentially aid the diagnosis of downhole flow conditions. In vertical wells, since elevational geothermal changes make the wellbore temperature sensitive to the amount {{and the type of}} fluids produced, temperature logs can be used successfully to diagnose the downhole flow conditions. However, geothermal temperature changes along the wellbore being small for horizontal wells, interpretations of a temperature log become difficult. The primary temperature differences for each phase (oil, water, and gas) are caused by frictional effects. Therefore, in developing a thermal model for horizontal wellbore, subtle temperature changes must be accounted for. In this project, we have rigorously derived governing equations for a producing horizontal wellbore and developed a prediction model of the temperature and pressure by coupling the wellbore and reservoir equations. Also, we applied Ramey's model (1962) to the build section and used an energy balance to infer the temperature profile at the junction. The multilateral wellbore temperature model was applied {{to a wide range of}} cases at varying fluid thermal properties, absolute values of temperature and pressure, geothermal gradients, flow rates from each lateral, and the trajectories of each build section. With the prediction models developed, we present inversion studies of synthetic and field examples. These results are essential to identify water or gas entry, to guide flow control devices in intelligent completions, and to decide if reservoir stimulation is needed in particular horizontal sections. This study will complete and validate these inversion studies...|$|R

In such a case the <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|R
