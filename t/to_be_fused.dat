5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets are made {{to be dependent on}} their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunk of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{has at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}. In Dinocephalosaurus, {{there appear to be}} no lumbar vertebrae, or vertebrae of the trunk lacking ribs. The ribs of the sacrum and tail also do not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> to their corresponding vertebrae. Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E
5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E

25|$|During 1968, Collins {{noticed that}} his legs were not working as they should, first during {{handball}} games, then as he walked down stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and the diagnosis was a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E
25|$|A nearly {{complete}} sacrum consisting of six vertebrae was {{recovered from the}} quarry, originally only lacking some ribs. The original description of Huabeisaurus suggested that only five sacral vertebrae were present {{based on the number}} of sacral ribs and intercostal foramina. The sacrum is currently heavily restored with plaster, but pre-restoration photographs show the sacrum in two oblique dorsal views and right lateral view. These photographs reveal that the last dorsal vertebra was taphonomically shifted posteriorly and to the right, crushing the right first sacral rib. Pre-restoration photographs and the number of broken sacral neural spines currently visible indicate that the sacrum was composed of at least six vertebrae. The first vertebra crushed into the sacrum could represent a seventh sacral vertebra; because the ribs of this dorsal vertebra are not observable firsthand or in photographs, but it cannot be verified whether or not these ribs contacted the ilium. The vertebra was interpreted as the last dorsal vertebra because: its neural spine does not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> to the neural spine posterior to it, and the usual sacral vertebral count for all but the most basal somphospondylans is six (with seven vertebrae in Neuquensaurus as the only derived exception).|$|E
500|$|From 1849 onwards, {{he urged}} {{a new concept}} of opera often {{referred}} to as [...] "music drama" [...] (although he later rejected this term), in which all musical, poetic and dramatic elements were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> together—the Gesamtkunstwerk. Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers. The orchestra's dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs, musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters, locales, and plot elements; their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama. These operas are still, despite Wagner's reservations, referred to by many writers as [...] "music dramas".|$|E

2500|$|Many older North American sockets {{have two}} {{different}} current and voltage ratings, most commonly 10A 250V/15A 125V. This {{has to do}} with a peculiarity of the National Electrical Code from 1923 to the 1950s. Originally, sockets were rated at 10A 250V, because the NEC limited lighting circuits to 10A. In 1923, the code changed to allow lighting circuits <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> at 15A, but the previous 10A rule still applied to circuits over 125V.

2500|$|In its {{earliest}} sense, the ancient Greek xeinos was the guest who received hospitality, {{as opposed to}} the xeinodokos or [...] "host", who welcomed strangers and provided them with hospitality. It is from this perspective, that of the immigrant, the stranger within a society, as opposed to that of society or the xeinodokos viewing the outsider, that Wodiczko employs the term xenology: [...] "Xenology is the art of refusal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused,</b> an art of delimitization, deidentification, and disintegration" [...] ("Xenology: Immigrant Instruments", exhibition statement distributed at the Galerie Lelong, New York, 1996). Wodiczko calls xenology [...] "a new, nomadic, and yet undeveloped form of understanding and expression".

2500|$|Manichaean {{also was}} her lifelong {{struggle}} with the very {{question of how to}} deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favor the merging of opposites, for which Byzantium served as a model: [...] "church and state, love and violence, life and death, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fused</b> again as in Byzantium." [...] More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life-sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to homosexuality and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman's desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism, but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, {{but at the same time}} she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with the life force: [...] "Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, one seems to be making an accusation against men. One is not doing that." [...] One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe, which is, of course, the result of an imperfect deity. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: [...] "I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love's business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe." [...] In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the [...] "weaker sex," [...] without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the [...] "sex war" [...] described in West's early short story [...] "Indissoluble Matrimony" [...] (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to [...] "win" [...] that war.|$|E
60|$|I {{had bought}} a small automobile, which I ran myself, {{and it was my}} custom to arrive at the farm every evening about five o'clock.

And even if I could summon back something of the sequence of our intercourse, it would be a mere repetition--growing on my part more irrational and insistent--of what I have already related. There were long, troubled, and futile silences when we sat together on the porch or in the woods and fields; when I wondered whether it were weakness or strength that caused Nancy to hold out against my importunities: the fears she professed of retribution, the benumbing effects of the conventional years, or the deep-rooted remnants of a Calvinism which--as she proclaimed--had lost definite expression to persist as an intuition. I recall something she said when she turned to me after one of these silences.|$|E
