Three experiments were performed: tick acquisition of T. equi from an experimentally infected <b>horse,</b> <b>tick</b> acquisition of T. equi from naturally infected foals and tick acquisition of T. equi from a chronically infected horse. A. cajennense adults were dissected and salivary glands were collected in aliquots. Methyl green pyronin staining of the salivary glands did not show the presence of hypertrophy of acini or cell nuclei normally suggestive of Theileria spp. infection. The pools of salivary glands were negative for Theileria DNA in nested PCR assays. Histopathological analysis failed to detect sporoblast and sporozoites of T. equi in salivary gland acini.

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{the present}} study were to serosurvey dogs, horses, and humans highly exposed to tick bites for anti-Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. antibodies, {{identify}} tick species present, and determine risk factors associated with seropositivity in a rural settlement of Paran√° State, southern Brazil. Eighty-seven residents were sampled, along with their 83 dogs and 18 horses, and individual questionnaires were administered. Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was performed on serum samples and positive samples were subjected to western blot (WB) analysis. Anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies were found in 4 / 87 (4. 6 %) humans, 26 / 83 (31. 3 %) dogs, and 7 / 18 (38. 9 %) horses by IFAT, with 4 / 4 humans also positive by WB. Ticks identified were mostly from dogs and included 45 / 67 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 21 / 67 Amblyomma ovale, and 1 / 67 A. cajennense sensu lato. All (34 / 34) <b>horse</b> <b>ticks</b> were identified as A. cajennense s. l [...] No significant association was found when age, gender, or presence of ticks was correlated to seropositivity to Borrelia sp.

40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Coxiella can be {{transmitted}} from ticks to humans during contact with animals; Coxiella may thus spread from the infected <b>horses</b> or <b>ticks</b> to humans. In this study, the presence of Coxiella burnetii and Coxiella-like endosymbionts (CLE) in ticks found on infested horses was determined using PCR and genotyping. A total of 213 ticks were randomly collected from 51 horses (4 - 5 <b>ticks</b> per <b>horse)</b> raised on Jeju Island, Korea, between 2009 and 2013. All ticks were morphologically identified as adult Haemaphysalis longicornis, a predominant tick species widespread in Korea. Based {{on the results of}} nested PCR and 16 S rRNA sequencing, CLE were detected in 121 (52. 4 %, 95 % CI: 45. 9 - 58. 8) ticks. CLE 16 S rRNA sequences from 9 randomly selected ticks were 100 % identical. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these 9 sequences were highly similar (97. 9 - 100 %) to the sequences of clade B species, like the CLE previously described to be found in Haemaphysalis spp. This study showed that CLE are prevalent in <b>ticks</b> that infest <b>horses</b> reared on Jeju Island, and this is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first study to describe CLE occurrence in ticks infesting animals reared in Korea.

60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a <b>tropical</b> jungle. <b>Horses,</b> which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs.

40|$|A set {{of studies}} was {{designed}} {{in order to}} better understand the exposure of horses in Canada to Ixodes-borne diseases, namely equine granulocytic anaplasmosis (EGA, caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum) and Lyme borreliosis (LB, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi). In the first study, equine serum samples submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories in SK, MB and ON were tested for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi, using the point-of-care SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ ELISA. Horses seropositive to EGA were found in SK and MB and horses seropositive to LB were found in SK, MB and ON. Overall seroprevalence according to the SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ ELISA was 0. 53 % for EGA and 1. 6 % for LB. Samples that tested positive for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum (n= 2) and B. burgdorferi (n= 6) by SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ ELISA and 2 randomly selected subsets of samples that tested negative (n= 92 each) were then re-tested using currently recommended serologic methods, and test results were compared. A lack of agreement was found between the SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for EGA (McNemar test p = 0. 000001). Agreement of the SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ ELISA and ELISA confirmed with Western Blot (WB) for LB was only fair (Kappa 0. 23). Due to the lack of agreement between serologic tests for EGA and LB in the first study, another study to further evaluate the agreement among available serologic tests was conducted. A set of 50 convenience serum samples submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory in SK was tested by SNAP¬Æ 4 Dx¬Æ Plus ELISA for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi. Samples were also tested by IFA for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum in two referral laboratories, and by IFA, ELISA confirmed with WB and Equine Lyme multiplex assay for antibodies against B. burgdorferi in three referral laboratories. Again, test results varied between the different tests. For EGA, all 3 pair-wise test comparisons lacked agreement. For LB, agreement between tests ranged from poor to fair. Differences in test methodology and antigens used, cut-off settings between the laboratories and false positive or false negative results are likely the cause for the different assessment of the same sample as seropositive or seronegative. In the third study, the goal was to describe potential risk factors for exposure of horses in Canada to EGA and LB. Management factors in horses that tested seropositive or seronegative for EGA or LB, respectively, in the previous studies were evaluated. Horse owners were surveyed with regard to their horses‚Äô signalment, timing of pasture housing, and province of residence, travel history, tick infestation history, history of Lyme vaccination and history of previously diagnosed tick-borne disease. Response rate (11. 5 %) and the number of seropositive horses available for evaluation were low, which precluded statistical analysis. The majority of seropositive horses resided in SK, was pastured in the fall, did not have a recent travel history and had not had visible tick infestation. These observations supported exposure of horses to tick-borne diseases within Canada. Potential risk factors require further investigation. As information about <b>tick</b> infestation in <b>horses</b> is scarce in general, a passive surveillance study of <b>horse</b> <b>ticks</b> in SK was conducted in 2012 and 2013. A total of 833 ticks from over 86 horses were received. All ticks were Dermacentor species, i. e. D. albipictus, D. andersoni and D. variabilis.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Autochthonous {{populations of}} Dermacentor reticulatus ticks in the Netherlands were {{discovered}} after fatal cases of babesiosis occurred in resident dogs in 2004. The presence of D. reticulatus in the Netherlands has also {{linked with the}} emergence of piroplasmosis in the resident horse population. The aim {{of this study was to}} put together results of continued surveillance of field sites and hosts for this tick in the Netherlands and also in Belgium and determine their infection status for Babesia and Theileria species. METHODS : Ticks were collected from the vegetation at 11 locations between 2011 and 2013. D. reticulatus ticks were also collected from different hosts between 2007 and 2013. Ticks were screened by PCR and reverse line blot (RLB). RESULTS : A total of 1368 D. reticulatus ticks were collected from 4 previously known field locations and from 5 new locations in the Netherlands and from 2 sites in Belgium (one old and one new location). A total of 855 ticks collected from 8 locations in the Netherlands and 2 locations in Belgium were tested. Fourteen ticks (1, 64 %) collected at 4 field locations (Dintelse Gorzen, Rozenburg, Slikken van de Heen and St. Philipsland) were positive for Babesia canis, whereas two ticks were positive for Babesia caballi, one tick in the Dintelse Gorzen in the Netherlands and one tick was found positive in De Panne in Belgium. A further 1092 D. reticulatus ticks were collected between 2007 and 2013 from 40 dogs (132 ticks), two ticks from two humans, 51 <b>ticks</b> from 15 <b>horses,</b> two <b>ticks</b> from two cats, one tick from a roe deer, whereas most ticks (904) were collected from cattle (n = 25). Ticks were found throughout the year on dogs in nearly all provinces of the Netherlands. None of the ticks collected from these hosts were infected. CONCLUSIONS : D. reticulatus is continuing its spread into novel areas. The finding that some autochthonous ticks are infected with B. canis and B. caballi poses a threat to the resident dog and horse population and justifies year-round tick control measures. Prof. Frederic Beugnet and Dr. Fabien Danlois of Merial are thanked for their continued interest and financial support for this study. [URL]...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the red blood cell haemolysate concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) and the plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) from endurance horses in different distances at high speed in a <b>tropical</b> climate. Fifteen <b>horses</b> were tested; five at 160 km (18. 54 - 17. 16 km/h race speed), five at 120 km (21. 53 - 17 km/h race speed) and five at 80 km (20. 06 - 18. 01 km/h race speed). Blood samples were collected at rest, immediately after and three hours after the horses left the final vet check and three, seven and fourteen days after the race. No significant increases (P > 0. 05) in the levels of SOD, GPx, GSH, CAT or MDA were observed for any of the times or distances examined.

40|$|Abstract Background Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative {{agent of}} granulocytic anaplasmosis, affects {{several species of}} wild and domesticated mammals, {{including}} horses. We used direct and indirect methods to compare and evaluate exposure to A. phagocytophilum in horses in northern Tunisia. Methods Serum from 60 horses was tested by IFA for antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, and whole blood was tested for A. phagocytophilum 16 S rRNA gene using a nested-PCR. To examine the risk of A. phagocytophilum transmission, 154 ticks that had been collected from horses were examined {{for the presence of}} A. phagocytophilum by nested-PCR targeting 16 S rRNA gene. Results This {{is the first time that}} A. phagocytophilum has been detected in horses in Tunisia, with an overall seroprevalence of 40 / 60 (67 %). Six of the seroreactive samples (10 %) had an IFA titer of 1 : 80, 14 (23 %) of 1 : 160, 8 (13 %) of 1 : 320 and 12 (20 %) a titer 1 [*]‚â•[*] 640. The seroprevalence revealed no significant regional and sex differences. In contrast, a significant difference was observed between breeds. Eight (13 %) of the horses were positive for A. phagocytophilum in the PCR, with no significant breed and age differences. Hyalomma marginatum was a predominant tick species (130 / 154), and 3 were infected by A. phagocytophilum (a prevalence of 2. 3 %). The concordance rate of A. phagocytophilum detection between IFA and PCR had a k value of ‚àí 0. 07.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Babesia equi replicates within erythrocytes. During {{the acute}} phase of infection, B. equi can reach {{high levels of}} parasitemia, resulting in a hemolytic crisis. Horses that recover from the acute phase of the disease remain chronically infected. Subsequent transmission is dependent upon the ability of vector ticks to acquire B. equi and, following development and replication, establishment of B. equi in the salivary glands. Although restriction of the movement of chronically infected horses with B. equi {{is based on the}} presumption that ticks can acquire and transmit the parasite at low levels of long-term infection, parasitemia levels during the chronic phase of infection have never been quantified, nor has transmission been demonstrated. To address these epidemiologically significant questions, we established long-term B. equi infections (> 1 year), measured parasitemia levels over time, and tested whether nymphal Boophilus microplus ticks could acquire and, after molting to the adult stage, transmit B. equi to naive horses. B. equi levels during the chronic phase of infection ranged from 103. 3 to 106. 0 /ml of blood, with fluctuation over time within individual <b>horses.</b> B. microplus <b>ticks</b> fed on chronically infected horses with mean parasite levels of 105. 5 ¬± 100. 48 /ml of blood acquired B. equi, with detection of B. equi in the salivary glands of 7 to 50 % of fed ticks, a range encompassing the percentage of positive ticks that had been identically fed on a horse in the acute phase of infection with high parasitemia levels. Ticks that acquired B. equi from chronically infected horses, as well as those fed during the acute phase of infection, successfully transmitted the parasite to naive horses. The results unequivocally demonstrated that chronically infected horses with low-level parasitemia are competent mammalian reservoirs for tick transmission of B. equi...|$|R
40|$|The role of African {{wildlife}} in {{the occurrence of}} vector-borne infections in domestic animals has gained renewed interest as emerging and re-emerging infections occur worldwide at an increasing rate. In Africa, biodiversity conservation {{and the expansion of}} livestock production have increased the risk of transmitting vector-borne infections between wildlife and livestock. The indigenous African pathogens with transboundary potential, such as Rift Valley fever virus, African horse sickness virus, bluetongue virus, lumpy skin disease virus, African swine fever virus, and blood-borne parasites have received the most attention. There is no evidence for persistent vector-borne viral infections in African wildlife. For some viral infections, wildlife may act as a reservoir through the inter-epidemic circulation of viruses with mild or subclinical manifestations. Wildlife may also act as introductory or transporting hosts when moved to new regions, e. g. for lumpy skin disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus and West Nile virus. Wildlife may also act as amplifying hosts when exposed to viruses {{in the early part of}} the warm season when vectors are active, with spillover to domestic animals later in the season, e. g. with bluetongue and African <b>horse</b> sickness. Some <b>tick</b> species found on domestic animals are more abundant on wildlife hosts; some depend on wildlife hosts to complete their life cycle. Since the endemic stability of a disease depends on a sufficiently large tick population to ensure that domestic animals become infected at an early age, the presence of wildlife hosts that augment tick numbers may be beneficial. Many wild ungulate species are reservoirs of Anaplasma spp., while the role of {{wildlife in}} the epidemiology of heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium infection) has not been elucidated. Wild ungulates are not usually reservoirs of piroplasms that affect livestock; however, there are two exceptions: zebra, which are reservoirs of Babesia caballi and Theileria equi, and buffalo, which are reservoirs of Theileria parva. The latter causes Corridor disease when transmitted from buffalo to cattle, but this appears to be a self-limiting condition, at least in southern Africa. Wild animals are important reservoirs of tsetse-transmitted Trypanosoma spp. infection. The distribution and abundance of some tsetse species, e. g. Glossina morsitans and G. pallidipes, are closely related to the occurrence of their preferred wildlife hosts. [URL]...|$|R

Of the further 18 species thus far reported in the literature as present in the state, but unavailable for examination: only Ornithodoros brasiliensis (humans and their habitations) (Neotropical), Ixodes affinis (deer) (Nearctic/Neotropical) and I. auritulus (birds) (Nearctic/Neotropical/Afrotropical/ Australasian) are considered likely; 13 species would benefit from corroborative local data but the majority appear unlikely; reports of A. maculatum (Nearctic/Neotropical, but circum-Caribbean) are considered erroneous; the validity of A. fuscum is in doubt. The very recent, first known report of the <b>tropical</b> Anocentor nitens (<b>horses)</b> (Nearctic/Neotropical), but still apparent absence of the tropical A. cajennense (catholic) (Nearctic/Neotropical) and the sub-tropical/temperate Ixodes pararicinus (cattle) (Neotropical) in Rio Grande do Sul are important for considerations on their current biogeographical distribution and its dynamics in South America.

The purpose of the first study {{of this paper was}} to demonstrate the tick infestation and the role of it in the transmission of the disease. In equines with contact directly with cattle, the serum incidence of the disease was 81, 8 % and in this group, 31, 8 % of this <b>horses</b> had <b>tick</b> infestation. In the equines that didn t have contact with cattle, the incidence of the disease was 12 % and no tick was found in this horses. The most efficient drug in the treatment of the disease is imidocarb dipropionate. Many studies had demonstrated different doses and protocols of treatment of the disease and the toxicity of it was obvious. No study had show the sterile of T. equi with this drug, but it s a way to treat the acute disease and to control the chronic theileriosis. The acute form of the disease is seemed with fever, icteric and death. The chronic kind of it is seemed with covered coat, hyporexia, low performance in athlete horses and loss of weight. The goal of the second study of this paper was to show the toxicity and the metabolic effects of imidocarb dipropionate drug into two protocols of treatment (two groups, 2 and 4 mg/kg) in serum positive horses to theileriosis. It was seemed through hepatic and renal profile that 2 mg/kg of the drug have low toxicity. Horses infected with T. equi keep with the disease {{for the rest of your}} lives, and the drug control with imidocarb dipropionate is necessary. The goal of the third study of this paper was to demonstrated, through immunologic test and clinic examination that 2 mg/kg of imidocarb dipropionate monthly can control the chronic disease even in stress situations. One group received monthly, through 6 mouths, 2 mg/kg of imidocarb dipropionate and the other group, once, in the beginning of it, 4 mg/kg. The conclusion of this paper is that the incidence of equine theileriosis have a directly relation with the catle contact because it cause the tick Rhipicephalus Boophilus mircoplus infestation. Mensal dosis with 2 mg/kg of imidocarb dipropionate is efficient in the disease control and it had demonstrated that it is not toxic for equine...|$|R
