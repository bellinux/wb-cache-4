5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores even when <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person</b> takes the same test {{over and over}} again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person</b> at different times.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most ancient}} [...] "clowns" [...] {{have been found}} in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC.

5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years.

5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person</b> as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person</b> as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|It is also unknown {{under which}} Hellenized name the ancient {{historian}} Manetho listed Khaba.

As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E

5|$|Charles Oman {{proposed}} that Beornred, who in 757 emerged {{for a short}} time as ruler of Mercia before being driven out by Offa, could be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person</b> as Beonna. An alternative theory suggests that Beonna and Beornred may perhaps have been kinsmen from the same dynasty with ambitions to rule in both Mercia and East Anglia. No known member of the Wuffingas dynasty had a name commencing with B, but several Mercian rulers, including Beornred, used the letter.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>person.</b> Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E

Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author.
