5|$|A study {{began in}} 1999 {{to widen the}} road to six lanes between Valley Forge and Norristown. In October 2004, work began on {{widening}} <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> road, which was completed in November 2008 {{at a cost of}} $330 million.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} eastward, serving residential developments, commercial outlets, and John Paul Stevens High School. It intersects with SH151, where development {{once again}} becomes patchy. The most notable development along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> Potranco is a National Security Agency data center. State maintenance ends at an intersection with FM3487 (Culebra Road), slightly west of Interstate410 (I-410). Potranco Road continues {{as a city}} street until Ingram Road.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road numbers that {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length of}} DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road numbers that reflect former route designations; an example is the section of US 9 between Laurel and Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> road.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> NY149.|$|E
5|$|SR 3 {{begins at}} the {{junction}} with SR 36 south {{of the town of}} Peanut in Trinity County. SR 3 is also known as Bramlot Road from its southern terminus to Hayfork. <b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> road through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest parallels the Hayfork River. Once SR 3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes through the mountains to Douglas City and the junction with SR 299. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of Weaverville. SR 3 then separates from SR 299, providing access to the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area and Trinity Dam along Lewiston Lake.|$|E

5|$|SR85 {{continues}} {{north from}} Gila Bend towards the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. <b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> highway north of Gila Bend {{is a part}} of the National Highway System. The highway passes near the western edge of the Sonoran Desert National Monument and also provides access to the Buckeye Hills Recreational Area. SR85 continues northward to a crossing of the Gila River as it nears Buckeye. The highway intersects Buckeye Road which is where the original routing of US 80 and later SR85 followed into Phoenix before being rerouted onto its current alignment. The highway continues towards the north, crossing over the Buckeye Canal before reaching its northern terminus at exit112 on I-10.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is {{a relic of}} a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of the}} two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> expressway.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> SR52 had many {{effects on the}} {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on {{the western part of}} Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR52.|$|E

5000|$|But {{shifting}} {{the focus of}} sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> the original forest management term of sustainable yield {{from the use of}} renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like minerals). <b>This</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall 'sustainable development' in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of Earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: ...|$|R

5|$|The {{section of}} M-66 {{north of the}} US131 split had the highway's lowest AADT levels in the 2009 survey. MDOT {{reported}} that only 1,500vehicles use <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> road in 2009. Of these vehicles, only were 140trucks that used the segment of highway in 2009. The highway meanders through more forest lands through the community of Green River to East Jordan. M-66 follows Lake Street and turns to follow the western shore of the South Arm of Lake Charlevoix. The roadway turns inland through Ironton {{before returning to the}} lakeshore {{the rest of the way}} to Charlevoix. M-66 ends at an intersection with US31 south of downtown next to Lake Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Toby Creek's {{watershed}} {{is in part}} or all of 14 municipalities. It is in ten boroughs: Swoyersville, Pringle, Luzerne, Larksville, Kingston, Harveys Lake, Fort Fort, Edwardsville, Dallas, and Courtdale. It is also in four townships: Lehman Township, Kingston Township, Jackson Township, and Dallas Township. It is {{adjacent to}} watersheds {{such as those of}} Harveys Creek and Abrahams Creek. A 9-mile (15-kilometer) long stretch of land along the main stem of Toby Creek is highly urbanized. <b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> land begins in Dallas, near the creek's headwaters, and passes through Shavertown, Luzerne, Kingston, and Edwardsville. Both the Back Mountain and Endless Mountain regions are associated with the creek's watershed and are adjacent to it.|$|E
5|$|West of Winton, NY96 {{passes through}} the East Avenue Historic District, a {{primarily}} residential area with historic upper-class houses, including the George Eastman House. <b>This</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the route was narrowed in mid-2010 from four lanes to two, to improve the residential feel and reduce automobile speeds. At Alexander Street, the environment turns more commercial as the route enters the downtown area. After crossing the Inner Loop, the route passes the Little Theatre before terminating at a Y-junction with East Main Street.|$|E

5|$|M-71 {{starts in}} {{downtown}} Owosso {{at the corner}} of Main Street (M-21) and Water Street. It follows Water Street southeasterly until it reaches Washington Street. The highway follows Washington Street south and over the Shiawassee River and turns southeasterly on Corunna Avenue. M-71 runs parallel to, and in between, the river and a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Corunna Avenue continues this way through the community of Middletown and into Corunna. M-71 turns south through downtown Corunna on Shiawassee Street to McNeil Street. It is along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the highway that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measured the highest traffic volumes for M-71. In their 2009 survey, MDOT calculated that 10,577vehicles used this section of roadway in a measurement called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value is a count for the average traffic in a day for any average day of the year.|$|E
5|$|Starting July 28, 2012, Metrorail {{increased}} service along shared Green and Orange Line stations from Dadeland South to Earlington Heights Stations. Along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> shared track, trains arrive every 5 minutes {{during peak}} hours, every 7 minutes during mid-day hours, and every 15 minutes late nights and on weekends. At stations {{with only one}} service, trains arrive every 10 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 15 minutes at midday, and every 15–30 minutes after 6 p.m. until midnight with weekend service running every 30 minutes. Metrorail runs from 5 a.m. until midnight seven days a week. For a brief period from 2003 to April 2004 there was 24-hour service supported by the transit tax; between midnight and 5 a.m. trains arrived every 60 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} NY96 between exit29 and NY250 in Perinton {{serves as a}} major {{commercial}} strip, anchored {{by the presence of}} Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> NY96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NY96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch.|$|E

50|$|Working titles {{for this}} story {{included}} Man Power, Another World and The Fact of Fiction. The Mind Robber was originally composed of four episodes, but the preceding serial, The Dominators, was reduced from six to five episodes. This resulted in a sparse first episode being written, as they {{had to use the}} limited budget of the replaced episode. <b>This</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> the story also resulted in the first four episodes only running between 19 and 22 minutes in length, and Episode 5 being the shortest Doctor Who episode ever at slightly over 18 minutes.|$|R
5|$|The {{west side}} of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the {{south-west}} corner. Two of the towers were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead railway tunnel in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963. One of the remaining merlons on <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the walls' battlements has a stone finial on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a round tower, but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Xinjiang, {{considered}} part of the Turkestan region, consists of an amalgamation of deserts, oases, and dry steppe barely suitable for agriculture. When influence from the steppe powers of Mongolia waned, the various Central Asian oasis kingdoms and nomadic clans like the Göktürks and Uyghurs were able to form their own states and confederations that threatened China at times. China proper is connected to this area by the Hexi Corridor, a narrow string of oases bounded by the Gobi Desert to the north and the high Tibetan Plateau to the south. In addition to considerations of frontier defence, the Hexi Corridor also formed {{an important part of the}} Silk Road trade route. Thus it was also in China's economic interest to control <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> land, and hence the Great Wall's western terminus is in this corridor—the Yumen Pass during Han times and the Jiayu Pass during the Ming dynasty and thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, <b>this</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge.|$|E
