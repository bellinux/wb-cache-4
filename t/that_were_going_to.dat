5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for {{the cast and crew}} during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

Two days of replenishment at Saipan permitted her to steam in Task Force 58 (TF 58) for photographic reconnaissance and air strikes against the islands of the Palau Islands group. On 25 and 26 July, her planes struck enemy planes, ships, and ground installations. The Franklin departed on 28 July and headed for Saipan, and the following day she was shifted to TG 58.1.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
500|$|In April 2005, {{the band}} met in Los Angeles and began {{recording}} at the Sunset Sound studios. The following month {{in an interview}} with MTV News, lead guitarist Ben Harper revealed that the writing process was finished. In addition, Harper commented that the band recorded 19 songs for the album, 13 of which made the final cut. In August 2005, Yellowcard announced the songs, [...] "Lights and Sounds", [...] "Sure Thing Falling", and [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be featured in the album.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, bassist Guy Berryman revealed that the song {{was one of the}} older songs that the band had been working on and that they had to move it to one side from the list of songs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> appear in the album. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, urged them to include the track in the album, which led to the band to drag it back to the shortlist. The first verse of the song was taken from an unreleased song named [...] "December", written by frontman Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland in 1997. An early instrumental of the song from the Viva la Vida sessions was leaked into the internet in 2009, it contained an excerp from a previously performed song named [...] "Solid Ground (Until the Water Floats Over)" [...] as the intro, but it was scratched and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

500|$|After the race, No. 460 {{went back}} to its normal duties until March 1937, when it was loaned to the Long Island Rail Road. In January 1939, No. 460 was {{returned}} to the Pennsylvania, but was still occasionally used on Long Island as a [...] "short term 'loaner'". Starting in 1942, it hauled trains between Camden and Bay Head, New Jersey. [...] In 1951, parts were taken of other E6s locomotives <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be scrapped: the drivers on the engineer's (right) side are from PRR 1565, the air reservoir on the fireman's (left) side was from PRR 690 and the reservoir on the engineer's side was from PRR 782. 460's tender was replaced in 1952 with one from 1565; the original tender had been transferred to maintenance-of-way service. 460 was leased to the PennsylvaniaReading Seashore Lines in 1953 before being retired in 1955 and added to the Pennsylvania's collection of historic locomotives in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|After {{these had}} been reviewed, {{two of the}} {{original}} twenty-four were finalized as possibilities, A-140-F3 and A-140-F4. Differing primarily in their range ( [...] versus [...] at [...] ), they {{were used in the}} formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937, which was put forth by Rear-Admiral Fukuda Keiji; an endurance of 7,200nm was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of just turbines. The diesels were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the submarine tender Taigei. Their engines, which were similar to the ones <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be mounted in the new battleships, required a [...] "major repair and maintenance effort" [...] to keep them running due to a [...] "fundamental design defect". In addition, if the engines failed entirely, the [...] armored citadel deck roof that protected the proposed diesel engine rooms and attendant machinery spaces, would severely hamper any attempt to remove and replace them.|$|E
500|$|For many years, {{very little}} content {{from the game}} was ever {{released}} beyond screenshots that had been released to the media in promotion of the game prior to its cancellation. However, in 2006 {{a copy of a}} very early test engine was sold at auction to an anonymous collector who bought it for US$2500. An animated GIF image of the gameplay was initially released, and the disk image itself was leaked on July 17, 2007 after a fundraising project by the [...] "Assemblergames" [...] website community purchased the disc from the collector. [...] In 2006, Chris Senn opened the [...] "Sonic X-treme Compendium" [...] web site and began revealing large amounts of the game's development history to the public, including videos of early footage, a playable character named Tiara, and a large amount of previously unreleased concept music related to the title. He also was given permission by Hirokazu Yasuhara, the level designer {{for the majority of the}} original 16-bit Sonic titles, to post level designs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be put in the game. Senn, along with the community, announced intentions to recreate the game, but ultimately the project was canceled in January 2010.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} two months of 1915, the ship and her {{aircraft}} supported [...] Allied operations in Syria, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Aside from reconnaissance duties, they delivered and recovered Allied agents as well as observed for ships performing coastal bombardments. On 4 March, Aenne Rickmers was ordered to join several Allied ships <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bombard Smyrna, Turkey. A week later, she was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat Demir Hisar. The ship was hit by one torpedo in the Number 1 cargo hold; this was full of timber which limited water ingress and saved her from sinking. Aenne Rickmers arrived at Mudros the following day to begin repairs, but the repair crew was withdrawn a week later to work on the damaged battlecruiser [...] The seaplane carrier [...] (another merchant conversion) arrived on 20 March to load her aircraft and crew, leaving only a five-person skeleton crew behind. During a storm on 6 April, the ship dragged her anchors and ran aground on a sandy beach. She was temporarily repaired there and refloated on 12 May, sailing to Alexandria, Egypt two days later for permanent repairs and to off-load her cargo. This was completed by 18 June, but the ship lay idle {{until the end of the}} month when she was provided with an Arab crew and sailed to Port Said.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation.
