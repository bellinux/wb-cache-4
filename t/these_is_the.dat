The largest of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, founded by conservationist Willie Smits.

5|$|A {{small number}} of RNA-based {{biological}} catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ribosome which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.|$|E

There are classical and non-classical examples {{in the last two}} Kodaira dimension zero cases.c) Kodaira dimension 1. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> elliptic and quasi-elliptic surfaces not contained in the last two groups.d) Kodaira dimension 2. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> surfaces of general type.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} large firms also have their {{headquarters}} in Mogadishu. Among <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Trans-National Industrial Electricity and Gas Company, an energy conglomerate founded in 2010 that unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and telecommunications sectors. Other firms based in the city include Hormuud Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in southern and central Somalia. Telcom is another telecommunications service provider that is centered in the capital. The local Somali Energy Company specializes in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to residents and businesses within its service area in Banaadir. Villa and Mansion Architects, an international architectural firm founded by the Somali-British architect Alexander Yusuf, likewise has its regional offices in Mogadishu. Additionally, the International Bank of Somalia, which opened downtown in 2014, offers Islamic finance and international banking services via a swift code system. The Islamic Insurance Company (First Takaful and Re-Takaful Insurance Company) was concurrently established, and is the city's first full service insurance firm in many years. The Central Bank of Somalia, the national monetary authority, also has its headquarters in Mogadishu.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E

5|$|American Indian lore {{contains}} numerous legends {{to explain}} the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitat people. In their tale, the chief of all the gods and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published.

5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining <b>these</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
