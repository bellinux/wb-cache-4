5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> had come to hear his words, he urged all present {{to take up arms}} under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those {{who took part in the}} great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

50|$|INTERREG {{estimated}} {{there are}} up to 2,000,000 Silesians in Poland. In the Polish census of 2002, however, 173,153 people officially declared Silesian ethnicity, although only about 60,000 declared Silesian as their native language. In the 2011 Polish census, Silesian nationality was declared by 809 thousand responders out of 5 million in the region, including 362 <b>thousand</b> <b>who</b> declared it as their only ethnicity, 418 <b>thousand</b> <b>who</b> declared it as their first ethnicity, and 415 <b>thousand</b> <b>who</b> declared it jointly with a Polish nationality.|$|R

25|$|In 1915, a storm {{similar in}} {{strength}} and track to the 1900 hurricane struck Galveston. The 1915 storm brought a 12-ft (4-m) storm surge that tested the new seawall. Although 53people on Galveston Island {{lost their lives}} in the 1915 storm, this was a great reduction from the <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> died in 1900.|$|E

Around 1909, Superintendent Friedman expanded the Outing Program by placing boys in manufacturing corporations such as Ford Motor Company. Over sixty of the boys from Carlisle were subsequently hired and worked steadily for Ford. During the later part of World War I, about forty had good jobs in the Hog Island, Philadelphia, shipyards.|$|E

Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, remained with his grandfather's body for all three days, in accordance with AbaThembu tradition, which requires an adult male family member to remain with the body until burial.|$|E

25|$|In March 1524, Gil González Dávila {{became the}} first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador. {{followed}} by Hernán Cortés, had brought forces down from Mexico. Much of the conquest {{took place in the}} following two decades, first by groups loyal to Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal of Francisco Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado. In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> remained garrisoned in the region.|$|E
25|$|Ion Gavrilă-Ogoranu, {{a member}} of the Iron Guard's youth wing who led a {{resistance}} group in the Făgăraş Mountains from 1948 to 1956, and remained undetected until 1976, worked out a set of defining traits of the typical Romanian resistance group. According to this author, such a group was rather small, but could number up to 200 men. A resistance group was located in a mountainous/forested area which comprised some communities. It was supported by a significant number of inhabitants (up to several <b>thousands),</b> <b>who</b> provided shelter, food and information.|$|E
25|$|Mortality {{statistics}} for the famine are conspicuously unreliable, particularly for rural areas. They were generally collected by illiterate and underpaid village watchmen known as chowkidari, whose methods were unreliable even in normal times. Moreover, many of these died or migrated during the famine and went unreplaced for weeks. There was also no system in place for counting {{the deaths of the}} <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> died along roadsides or other areas while migrating away from rural villages. Finally, data deficiencies and unequal accuracy may explain some differences between rural and urban mortality statistics.|$|E

25|$|Under {{threat of}} death, imprisonment, {{military}} conscription {{or loss of}} income, about 20,000 constitutional priests were forced to abdicate or hand over their letters of ordination and 6,000– 9,000 were coerced to marry, many ceasing their ministerial duties. Some of those who abdicated covertly ministered to the people. By {{the end of the}} decade, approximately 30,000 priests were forced to leave France, and <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> did not leave were executed. Most of France was left without the services of a priest, deprived of the sacraments and any nonjuring priest faced the guillotine or deportation to French Guiana.|$|E
25|$|While {{the figures}} of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy {{remained}} commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, {{partly as a result}} of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. Francis Amasa Walker, Superintendent of the 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon General data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{following}} the Kargil War, all Indian channel broadcasts were limited or banned in Pakistan and after Pervaiz Musharraf's coup d'état, {{the media was}} privatised. To cater {{to the needs of}} <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> watched the Indian channels with regularity, programmes were broadcast to match the Indian content. Seeing this as an opportunity, bands returned on the music scene and started producing videos with a much richer content. In 2002-03, Ghazanfar Ali, producer and CEO of the Indus Media Group started his very first venture into the music industry with Indus Music, a channel dedicated to music {{following the}} formats used by Western Music Channels. The channel started {{as a part of the}} Indus Vision channel and was later started as separate channel in 2003. With nothing much to watch than a few Pakistani channels, the youngsters in the country would settle in for Indus Music and would become interested in music once again. In 2006 Indus TV Network in an agreement with MTV Intn;l converted Indus Music into MTV Pakistan which continued till 2011 to again become Indus Music.|$|E

25|$|Osman II {{designated}} Öküz Mehmed Pasha {{once again}} for the eastern front. Abbas learnt the Ottoman plan was to invade via Azerbaijan, take Tabriz {{then move on to}} Ardabil and Qazvin, which they could use as bargaining chips to exchange for other territories. The shah decided to lay a trap. He would allow the Ottomans to enter the country, then destroy them. He had Tabriz evacuated of its inhabitants while he waited at Ardabil with his army. In 1618, an Ottoman army of 100,000 led by the grand vizier, invaded and easily seized Tabriz. The vizier sent an ambassador to the shah demanding he make peace and return the lands taken since 1603. Abbas refused and pretended he was ready to set fire to Ardabil and retreat further inland rather than face the Ottoman army. When the vizier heard the news, he decided to march on Ardabil right away. This was just what Abbas wanted. His army of 40,000 commanded by Qarachaqay Khan was hiding at a crossroads on the way and they ambushed the Ottoman army in a battle at Sarab on 10 September 1618, which ended in complete victory for the Iranians. The beylerbeys of Rumelia, Diyarbakır and Van were among <b>thousands</b> <b>who</b> lost their lives.|$|E
