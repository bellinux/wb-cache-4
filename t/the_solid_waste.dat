25|$|The {{precursor}} to the modern septic tank was the cesspool in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s.

25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and collected it during the night.

2500|$|Startup fuel - Unlike mined uranium, mined thorium {{does not}} have a fissile isotope. Thorium {{reactors}} breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, but require a small amount of fissile material for initial start up. There is relatively little of this material available. This raises {{the problem of how to}} start the reactors in a short time frame. One option is to produce U-233 [...] in today's solid fueled reactors, then reprocess it out of <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> An LFTR can also be started by other fissile isotopes, enriched uranium or plutonium from reactors or decommissioned bombs. For enriched uranium startup, high enrichment is needed. Decommissioned uranium bombs have enough enrichment, but not enough is available to start many LFTRs. It is difficult to separate plutonium fluoride from lanthanide fission products. One option for a two-fluid reactor is to operate with plutonium or enriched uranium in the fuel salt, breed U-233 in the blanket, and store it instead of returning it to the core. Instead, add plutonium or enriched uranium to continue the chain reaction, similar to today's solid fuel reactors. When enough U-233 is bred, replace the fuel with new fuel, retaining the U-233 for other startups. A similar option exists for a single-fluid reactor operating as a converter. Such a reactor would not reprocess fuel while operating. Instead the reactor would start on plutonium with thorium as the fertile and add plutonium. The plutonium eventually burns out and U-233 is produced in situ. At the end of the reactor fuel life, the spent fuel salt can be reprocessed to recover the bred U-233 to start up new LFTRs.|$|E

Even there are the rigorous demands in related specifications for the design of the liner system in the landfill. Pollution of the groundwater and the soil beneath the landfill still occurred in a large number of rubbish landfills because of the seepage. To investigate the influence of the compact clay layer (CCL) on the seepage performance of the liner systems, parametric analyses are conducted to study the influence of the thickness of CCL and the hydraulic conductivity of CCL on the leakage performance of the liner system.
