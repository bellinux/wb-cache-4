40|$|Early Acheulian bifaces {{appear to}} be {{characterized}} by seven basic operations. After {{a brief description of}} each operation, I propose how the pattern of that operation had the capacity to serve as an analogue for a concept of the soul that could be expressed both in self-concept (selfobject) and interpersonal relations (object relations). 1. A ‘core ’ is flaked and the flake is trimmed, in turn, to become a ‘core ’ which, in turn, may be used as a source of flakes. There is a return or restoration of the ‘core’. The flake is treated like a core. In a sense this is a reduplication of the Oldowan pebble at the metalevel or next higher level of abstraction as a flake transformed into a core. Concept of ‘renewal, re-presencing, restoration, and reparation of the core’. Building upon the Classic Oldowan spiritual concept of ‘sustaining core-essence’, the Early Acheulians develop the thematic ‘restoration of the sustaining coreessence. ’ 2. Feature derived from Developed Oldowan A: ‘orientation of flake’, by verticality, top and bottom, and secondarily horizontality, left and right. # 2 combined with # 1 yields concept of ‘restoration or reparation of the core with orientation, uprightness (verticality) and balance (horizontality). ’ 3. Concept of interval, or constant quantity of space, used with an internal reference (Wynn 1989 : 58 - 61), as with respect to internal central point (e. g., very circular discoids, very spherical spheroids) or internal midline (e. g., bifaces). Concept of ‘internal central point, internal reference, inward dimension’. 4. Apply, elemental themes from the 2 X 4 matrix of oppositions, which is my paraphrase summary of Wynn. Wynn observes: “[a basic notion] was that of two dimensional shape. By this I mean simple curves, projections, concavities, and so on ” (1989 : 58 - 61). Given apparent straight edges on cleavers, that are actually—as Wynn notes—natural and due to breaking away of flake on natural cleavage lines, I have added the opposition between a natural edge and an intentionally <b>trimmed</b> <b>edge.</b> EDG...|$|E

40|$|Edge cracks {{affect the}} quality of rolled strip and the {{efficiency}} of production. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve our understanding of the evolution of edge cracks in cold rolling of thin strip. Experimental research and mechanics analysis were developed to investigate the effects of rolling parameters and initial microstructures on the evolution of edge cracks during rolling. Low carbon steel was prepared for experiments on a Hille 100 experimental rolling mill to examine the characteristics of edge cracks during cold rolling. The characteristics of edge cracks were evaluated by specific instruments, such as the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and surface profile-meters. An Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique was also used to analyse the features of rolled strips with edge cracks. The results obtained from the experiments show that rolling parameters such as thickness reduction, rolling speed and lubrication have significant effects on the initiation and propagation of edge cracks. A crack on the break area produced by a worn <b>trimmed</b> <b>edge</b> is much larger than that on the cut area, and the surface quality of the break area affects the growth of the crack. The crack increases with the ratio of edge drop, which indicates that the edge drop has a significant effect on edge cracks. When the total reduction in thickness exceeds 85 % (for this experiment, the thickness is about 0. 15 mm), the crack increases significantly and the reduction distribution also has a significant effect on the edge cracks. AFM and SEM observations have confirmed that the edge cracks originate from the porosity and the grooves of rougher surface. Rougher strip surface increases the concentration of stress and acts as a source of crack initiation during edge cracking. The initial microstructure of the rolled strip affects the initiation and propagation of edge cracks. Edge cracking was found to be sensitive to the size of the grain in the microstructure. The grain boundary is a barrier for edge crack initiation. A finer grain structure can increase the range of threshold stress intensity and also decrease the probability of crack initiation. A coarse microstructure resists crack propagation better due to blunted crack tip. Sheared edges and lubrication can delay the initiation and propagation of edge cracks. TEM shows that there are high density dislocations around the tip of edge crack and the inhomogeneous structure in a non-cracked area is a potential crack propagation direction. The stress intensity factor (SIF) solution to edge cracks has been investigated. The effective range of the stress intensity factor is of importance in defining crack growth rate. The efficiency and reliability of SIF analytical modelling has been demonstrated and the weight function was also applied in edge crack analysis. Three dimensional finite element method (FEM) was proposed to simulate the propagation of edge cracks in cold rolling of thin strip. The increasing pressure around the edge of the strip accelerates the propagation of edge cracks. More reduction causes more inhomogeneous deformation between the centre and the edge of rolled strip, which extends the edge cracks significantly. Light pass reduction and lubrication to reduce the propagation of edge cracks are recommended. The simulation provided further important information for improving the edge quality of rolled strip. The optimum condition to eliminate edge crack has been discussed and the proposed method for predicting edge crack can be utilised to make defect free products from rolling processes. It is recommended that using more lubrication could clarify how rolling conditions affect the evolution of edge cracks. The influence of the diameter of work rolls should be investigated, together with the testing of a wide range of materials including various chemical compositions and other steels. Further research about the effect of surface roughness and oxidation on edge cracks and the Crystal Plastic (CP) application in the analysis of the influence mechanism of microstructure on crack formation is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|Laser cutting {{implementation}} possibilities into paper {{making machine}} was studied {{as the main}} objective of the work. Laser cutting technology application was considered as a replacement tool for conventional cutting methods used in paper making machines for longitudinal cutting such as edge trimming at different paper making process and tambour roll slitting. Laser cutting of paper was tested in 70 ’s for the first time. Since then, laser cutting and processing has been applied for paper materials with different level of success in industry. Laser cutting can be employed for longitudinal cutting of paper web in machine direction. The most common conventional cutting methods include water jet cutting and rotating slitting blades applied in paper making machines. Cutting with CO 2 laser fulfils basic requirements for cutting quality, applicability to material and cutting speeds in all locations where longitudinal cutting is needed. Literature review provided description of advantages, disadvantages and challenges of laser technology when it was applied for cutting of paper material with particular attention to cutting of moving paper web. Based on studied laser cutting capabilities and problem definition of conventional cutting technologies, preliminary selection {{of the most promising}} application area was carried out. Laser cutting (trimming) of paper web edges in wet end was estimated to be the most promising area where it can be implemented. This assumption was {{made on the basis of}} rate of web breaks occurrence. It was found that up to 64 % of total number of web breaks occurred in wet end, particularly in location of so called open draws where paper web was transferred unsupported by wire or felt. Distribution of web breaks in machine cross direction revealed that defects of paper web edge was the main reason of tearing initiation and consequent web break. The assumption was made that laser cutting was capable of improvement of laser cut edge tensile strength due to high cutting quality and sealing effect of the edge after laser cutting. Studies of laser ablation of cellulose supported this claim. Linear energy needed for cutting was calculated with regard to paper web properties in intended laser cutting location. Calculated linear cutting energy was verified with series of laser cutting. Practically obtained laser energy needed for cutting deviated from calculated values. This could be explained by difference in heat transfer via radiation in laser cutting and different absorption characteristics of dry and moist paper material. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist (dry matter content about 25 - 40 %)) were tested for strength properties. It was shown that tensile strength and strain break of laser cut samples are similar to corresponding values of non-laser cut samples. Chosen method, however, did not address tensile strength of laser cut edge in particular. Thus, the assumption of improving strength properties with laser cutting was not fully proved. Laser cutting effect on possible pollution of mill broke (recycling of <b>trimmed</b> <b>edge)</b> was carried out. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist) were tested on the content of dirt particles. The tests revealed that accumulation of dust particles on the surface of moist samples can take place. This has to be taken into account to prevent contamination of pulp suspension when trim waste is recycled. Material loss due to evaporation during laser cutting and amount of solid residues after cutting were evaluated. Edge trimming with laser would result in 0. 25 kg/h of solid residues and 2. 5 kg/h of lost material due to evaporation. Schemes of laser cutting implementation and needed laser equipment were discussed. Generally, laser cutting system would require two laser sources (one laser source for each cutting zone), set of beam transfer and focusing optics and cutting heads. In order to increase reliability of system, it was suggested that each laser source would have double capacity. That would allow to perform cutting employing one laser source working at full capacity for both cutting zones. Laser technology is in required level at the moment and do not require additional development. Moreover, capacity of speed increase is high due to availability high power laser sources what can support the tendency of speed increase of paper making machines. Laser cutting system would require special roll to maintain cutting. The scheme of such roll was proposed as well as roll integration into paper making machine. Laser cutting can be done in location of central roll in press section, before so-called open draw where many web breaks occur, where it has potential to improve runability of a paper making machine. Economic performance of laser cutting was done as comparison of laser cutting system and water jet cutting working in the same conditions. It was revealed that laser cutting would still be about two times more expensive compared to water jet cutting. This is mainly due to high investment cost of laser equipment and poor energy efficiency of CO 2 lasers. Another factor is that laser cutting causes material loss due to evaporation whereas water jet cutting almost does not cause material loss. Despite difficulties of laser cutting implementation in paper making machine, its implementation can be beneficial. The crucial role in that is possibility to improve cut edge strength properties and consequently reduce number of web breaks. Capacity of laser cutting to maintain cutting speeds which exceed current speeds of paper making machines what is another argument to consider laser cutting technology in design of new high speed paper making machines...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The mathematical modeling for the prediction of cutting forces was also done using Artificial Neural Network and Regression Analysis...|$|R

The RLMwD technique is being developed at University West in cooperation with Swedish industry for solid freeform fabrication of fully dense metal structures.

The RLMwD process {{can also be used}} for repair or modification of existing components. This paper faces the challenge of designing a control system for maintaining stable process variables, such as a constant layer height and a stable component temperature, during the entire manufacturing process. Several problems are identified and discussed in the paper, e. g. the difficulty of obtaining the bead height in the weld pool environment.
