5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E

Sharp {{to defend}} him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession.

Darby <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E

5|$|Waite <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> declare martial law, but {{the mine}} owners refused to disband their deputy force. Gen.

Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation.
