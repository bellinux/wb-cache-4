40|$|AbstractTooth {{replacement}} in polyphyodont is a well-organized {{system for}} maintenance of homeostasis of teeth, containing the dynamic structural change in skeletal tissues {{such as the}} attachment bone, which is the supporting element of teeth. Histological analyses have revealed the character of tooth replacement, however, the cellular mechanism of how skeletal tissues are modified during tooth replacement is largely unknown. Here, we showed {{the important role of}} osteoblasts for controlling osteoclasts to modify the attachment bone during tooth replacement in medaka pharyngeal <b>teeth,</b> <b>coupled</b> with an osterix-DsRed/TRAP-GFP transgenic line to visualize osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In the turnover of the row of attachment bones, these bones were resorbed at the posterior side where most developed functional teeth were located, and generated at the anterior side where teeth were newly erupted, which caused continuous tooth replacement. In the cellular analysis, osteoclasts and osteoblasts were located at attachment bones separately, since mature osteoclasts were localized at the resorbing side and osteoblasts gathered at the generating side. To demonstrate the role of osteoclasts in tooth replacement, we established medaka made deficient in c-fms-a by TALEN. c-fms-a deficient medaka showed hyperplasia of attachment bones along with reduced bone resorption accompanied by a low number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts, indicating an important role of osteoclasts in the turnover of attachment bones. Furthermore, nitroreductase-mediated osteoblast-specific ablation induced disappearance of osteoclasts, indicating that osteoblasts were essential for maintenance of osteoclasts for the proper turnover. Taken together, our results suggested that the medaka attachment bone provides the model to understand the cellular mechanism for tooth replacement, and that osteoblasts act in the coordination of bone morphology by supporting osteoclasts...|$|R

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of odontometric variation {{among the people}} of south Asia is limited, yet variation in tooth size {{has the potential to}} answer important questions regarding genetic relationships among contemporary social groups. Here, we report tooth crown diameters for 3 ethnic groups (Bhils, Garasias, Rajputs) from Gujarat State and contrast these data with 10 social groups from north, northwestern, northeastern, west-central, and south India. Univariate descriptive and inferential statistics are presented by group and by sex. Examination of crown diameters demonstrates that tooth size differs significantly between social groups in Gujarat. Cluster analysis of sex-standardized odontometric mean parameter values indicates that in apportionment of tooth size throughout the dentition low -status Garasias are slightly more similar to tribal Bhils than they are to high-status Rajputs. Principal components analysis by sex identifies three components that together account for 58. 2 % and 56. 3 % of the total variance among Gujarati females and males, respectively. These components are identified as overall size, a dimensional contrast between mesiodistal diameters and buccolingual diameters, and a dimensional contrast between mesiodistal diameters and buccolingual diameters among anterior <b>teeth</b> <b>coupled</b> with a contrast between anterior teeth (incisors, canines) and posterior teeth(premolars, molars). Ordination of group component scores indicates that (1) males and females of each social group exhibit a pattern of tooth size apportionment most similar to the opposite member of that same social group and (2) low-status Garasias exhibit a tooth size apportionment profile intermediate between tribal Bhils and high-status Rajputs. To place this pattern of odontometric variation among modem Gujaratis in larger perspective, data from Gujaratim ales were contrasted against males from 10 social groups from north, northwestern, northeastern, west-central, and south India. Cluster analysis of group-standardized odontometric mean parameter values indicates that (1) Gujarati social groups, regardless of social status or caste adherence, are more similar to one another than to any other group included in this analysis and (2) Gujarati social groups share closest affinities with geographically proximate social groups (Ahirs, Jats, Kunbis). Principal components analysis yields three components that combine to explain 64. 0 % of the total variance. These components are interpreted as a dimensional contrast among posterior teeth, a dimensional contrast among nonmolar teeth, and a contrast between anterior and posterior teeth. Ordination of group component scores indicates that tribal Bhils possess tooth size apportionment profiles that are different from other Indian tribal groups but are proximate to those found among Gujarati Hindu groups. This apparent anomalous result supports historical and ethnographic evidence of prolonged Hinduization and genetic admixture of tribal Bhils from the plains of eastern Gujarat with their Hindu caste neighbors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many non-mammalian vertebrates, adult dentitions {{result from}} {{cyclical}} rounds of tooth regeneration wherein simple unicuspid teeth {{are replaced by}} more complex forms. Therefore and by contrast to mammalian models, the numerical majority of vertebrate teeth develop shape {{during the process of}} replacement. Here, we exploit the dental diversity of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes to ask how vertebrates generally replace their dentition and in turn how this process acts to influence resulting tooth morphologies. First, we used immunohistochemistry to chart organogenesis of continually replacing cichlid teeth and discovered an epithelial down-growth that initiates the replacement cycle via a labial proliferation bias. Next, we identified sets of co-expressed genes from common pathways active during de novo, lifelong tooth replacement and tooth morphogenesis. Of note, we found two distinct epithelial cell populations, expressing markers of dental competence and cell potency, which may be responsible for tooth regeneration. Related gene sets were simultaneously active in putative signaling centers associated with the differentiation of replacement teeth with complex shapes. Finally, we manipulated targeted pathways (BMP, FGF, Hh, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin) in vivo with small molecules and demonstrated dose-dependent effects on both tooth replacement and tooth shape. Our data suggest that the processes of tooth regeneration and tooth shape morphogenesis are integrated via a common set of molecular signals. This linkage has subsequently been lost or decoupled in mammalian dentitions where complex tooth shapes develop in first generation dentitions that lack the capacity for lifelong replacement. Our dissection of the molecular mechanics of vertebrate <b>tooth</b> replacement <b>coupled</b> to complex shape pinpoints aspects of odontogenesis that might be re-evolved in the lab to solve problems in regenerative dentistry...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 161 - 176 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing turbomachinery users today is that of torsional vibration. In contrast to lateral rotordynamics problems, torsional failures are especially heinous since the first symptom of a problem is often a broken shaft, gear <b>tooth,</b> or <b>coupling.</b> The difficulty of detecting incipient failures in the field makes {{the performance of a}} thorough torsional vibration analysis an essential component of the turbomachinery design process. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} provide such a procedure for the special case where the turbomachine is driven by a synchronous motor. Synchronous motors are one of the most notorious sources of torsional vibration problems because of the large pulsating torques they generate during startups. The torsional shaft stresses generated by these large pulsations are usually greater than the shaft material endurance limits, thereby causing the lives of such machines to be limited. The determination of the number of startups that these machines can survive is, therefore, a critical portion of their design process. It is the authors? experience that there is a great deal of confusion over the proper way to do this. The full impact of the confusion was seen on a recently designed compressor train where the use of one method showed the allowable number of starts to be zero while a second procedure predicted infinite life. In an attempt to alleviate this confusion, a logical, step-by-step procedure, based on the strain-life theory of failure, was generated and is presented herein. An example illustrating how the authors used this procedure to design a critical 66, 000 hp air compressor is also presented.

The maxilla (A point) was found to move forward by 0.8  mm over a period of 1.3  years. In a study with protraction facemask [10], A point was found to move forward by an average of 1.8  mm over a 6 -month period. Baccetti found 2.3 -mm- and 3.1 -mm-forward movements of A point in young patients treated using protraction facemasks [11, 17]. Most of the studies reported forward movements ranging from 1.5 to 3.4  mm [13 – 15]. Loiu reported a 5.8 -mm-forward movement of the maxilla in 3  months using a maxillary expansion and constriction protocol in conjunction with protraction facemask [25]. This is because the expansion protocol allows loosening of the maxillary sutures and the protraction spring acts on the sutures 24  h per day. The correction using the inter-arch spring-loaded module also acts on the maxillary sutures full time. However, the force magnitude (150 g per side) is smaller than those exerted by the facemask (450 g per side). Therefore, the results were comparable to those reported using removable appliances. Atalay found an increase in the length of the maxilla (Co-A point) of 1.8  mm using the tandem traction bow appliance [12]. Baik et al. reported a forward movement of 1.3  mm with the FRIII removable functional appliance over 1.3  years of treatment [8]. The inter-arch spring module, when attached to the pivot teeth, will cause these teeth to resist the force expressed by the 150 -g NiTi coil spring on each side. When the pivot <b>teeth</b> are <b>coupled</b> with the 300 -g coil springs, they will reinforce and serve as the anchorage teeth.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a model for the prediction of the dynamic behavior of geared systems with emphasis on understanding the effects and importance of parametric excitation resulting from meshing gear teeth. Utilizing a combination of sub-system models developed through both experimental and theoretical techniques, a complete model of a drive train system is used to validate both modeling and solution procedures. The source of the parametric excitation is the time-varying stiffness associated with the meshing of gear teeth. The gear tooth model has been developed using finite element analysis. The gear <b>tooth</b> model is <b>coupled</b> with shaft and bearing models developed using an energy approach and finally with a housing model found using experimental modal techniques. Analysis of the resulting equations of motion is performed using techniques founded in Floquet theory allowing for the determination of both system response and stability properties. Based on the results, it can be concluded that spiral bevel gears operating at small contact ratios are likely to give rise to large amplitude vibrations and parametric instabilities. These responses are due to a combination of low mean gear mesh stiffness and relatively large amplitude parametric excitation created by meshing spiral bevel gears operating at low contact ratios. ...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence and root canal anatomy of maxillary second premolar in a sample of Sudanese population. For this purpose, 100 extracted maxillary second premolars and 25 clinical radiographs collected from three cities of Khartoum state (Khartoum, Omdurman, Bahary), were studied. The age group was ranged from 15 - 45 years. These teeth were radiographed, cross-sectioned and their root canal morphology was recorded. Then root and root canal lengths were measured. Also, the external anatomy was observed in regard to the curvature, number of roots and shape of the canals in cross-sections. The data obtained from this study revealed that the number of roots were 82. 2 % one- rooted, 16. 8 % two-rooted and 1 % three-rooted. According to the curvature 30. 7 % were straight, 68. 3 % curved with 55. 4 % curved distally, 17. 6 % curved mesially and 10. 8 % curved in other directions (bucully and lingually).

The average of the root canal length was measured from a tracing paper and was found to be 14. 01 mm ± 1. 72 mm, in roots with one canal the average was 13. 98 mm & in roots with two canals the average was (for the buccal canal 13. 99 mm, for the lingual canal 14. 06 mm), the average length of the canal and root canal as measured by an endodontic ruler were 21. 4 mm and 20. 7 mm, respectively. The average of the maxillary second premolar angulation was found to be 11 º ± 4 º. The prevalence of the canal system configurations of the maxillary second premolar in Sudanese sample population showed that 82. 2 % were onerooted, 52 % have two root canals, 69 % of the specimens were curved and most of them (55. 4 %) are curved distally. According to Vertucci (1974) classification(appendix 3), the findings by both the radiographic and the sectioning techniques indicate that type IV have the highest percentage (35. 6 %) while type VIII have the lowest percentage (1 %). The presence of accessory canals was 6. 9 %, the delta were 10. 9 %, horizontal interconnection was 1 % by the radiographic technique and the presence of delta was 1 % by the sectioning technique. The shape of the cross section of the canal at the cervical area were oval and it tends to be round as it tapered toward the apex in 65 % of the specimens. Radiographically in the bucco-lingual view, it appears thread-shape in the majority of the specimens (97. 2 %). The canal have two apical foramina n (64 %) of the specimens and one foramen in (36 %) of the specimen. Results shows similarities and differences with other studies, which are all conducted in a Caucasian populations that needs more studies to be confirmed in Suda...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 153 - 176 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing turbomachinery users today is that of torsional vibration. In contrast to lateral rotordynamics problems, torsional failures are especially heinous since the first symptom of a problem is often a broken shaft, gear <b>tooth,</b> or <b>coupling.</b> The difficulty of detecting incipient failures in the field makes {{the performance of a}} thorough torsional vibration analysis an essential component of the turbomachinery design process. The primary objective of this tutorial is to provide such a procedure for the special case where the turbomachine is driven by a synchronous motor. Synchronous motors {{are one of the most}} notorious sources or torsional vibration problems because of the large pulsating torques they generate during startups. The torsional shaft stresses generated by these large pulsations are usually greater than the shaft material endurance limits, thereby, causing the lives of such machines to be limited. The determination of the number of startups that these machines can survive is, therefore, a critical portion of their design process. It is the authors? experience that there is a great deal of confusion over the proper way to do this. The full impact of this confusion was seen on a recently designed compressor train where the use of one method showed the allowable number of starts to be zero while a second procedure predicted infinite life. In an attempt to alleviate this confusion, a logical, step-by-step procedure, based on the strain-life theory of failure, was generated and is presented herein. An example illustrating how the authors used this procedure to design a critical 66, 000 hp air compressor is also presented. The authors believe that employment of this method may well save the user from the need to introduce an expensive and unwieldy Holsetstyle damping coupling into some future compressor train. Although the presented analytical procedure is quite rigorous, there are cases, especially on critical equipment, where it is wise to augment its predictions with torsional test data taken from the field. The best way to do this in synchronous mo*tor-driven equipment is to apply strain gauges to critical shafts in the drive train and measure the actual torques that are generated during startup. Accordingly, a general description of strain gauge testing fundamentals is provided to familiarize all users with it. Additionally, the use of this valuable testing procedure is illustrated via the same 66, 000 hp air compressor that was used to illustrate the analytical procedure. The tutorial closes with a comparison of the obtained analytical and test results and an illustration of how the authors used the testing to ?fine-tune? the analytical results...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 189 - 222 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing turbomachinery users today is that of torsional vibration. In contrast to lateral vibration problems, torsional failures are especially heinous since the first symptom of a problem is often a broken shaft, gear <b>tooth,</b> or <b>coupling.</b> The difficulty of detecting incipient failures in the field makes {{the performance of a}} thorough torsional vibration analysis an essential component of the turbomachinery design process. The authors' purpose is to provide users with a practical design procedure {{that can be used to}} ensure that their systems will not encounter major difficulties in the field. It has been the authors' experience that most turbomachinery users encounter little difficulty in determining their machine's natural frequencies due to the large number of resources available in that area. However, problems often arise when they must translate this information into an accurate prediction of whether or not their design will experience torsional vibration problems. Accordingly, this presentation concentrates on the steps that should be taken once the natural frequencies have been found. A cursory review is presented of popular procedures, such as Holzer's method, for obtaining the machine's natural frequencies and mode shapes. This area is purposely limited in detail since there are many excellent resources in the literature that may be consulted for a more rigorous treatment. The generation of an interference or Campbell diagram is then treated in far more detail. Of particular interest is generation of the upward sloping lines representing the system's excitation frequencies. The various excitation sources commonly found in turbomachinery, such as gears, vaned impellers, and electric motors, are discussed along with the excitation frequencies that each introduces into the system. The unique problems associated with the startup of systems driven by synchronous motors are also described. Once the interference points have been generated, the user then generally has two choices for dealing with them. Either design changes, such as alteration of couplings, are implemented to eliminate the interferences or the interference points are subjected to further analysis. Many users automatically opt for the first alternative, since they believe they must avoid resonance conditions at all costs. While this is an admirable and worthy goal under ideal circumstances, the cost of achieving it is often unwieldy. Instead, the procedure provided herein advocates analysis of all interference points prior to the implementation of costly design changes. The analysis might be as simple as inspection of the appropriate mode shape or the unit's torque vs speed curve. Interference points can frequently be eliminated from consideration based on these inspections revealing that the induced torques are negligible. The resonant points that cannot be thereby removed should be investigated using a damped forced vibration analysis. Detailed guidelines for performing the damped analysis are presented herein. Methods for determining the magnitudes and locations of excitation torques for various machinery classes are given. Procedures are provided for obtaining damping coefficients for typical sources such as impellers, shaft material hysteresis, and couplings. Finally, users are provided with ground rules for utilizing the calculated cyclic torques and stresses to determine their design's adequacy. If the analysis identifies problem areas, practical and relatively simple rectification methods are provided. Lastly, a complete step-by-step analysis procedure is given that summarizes the entire preceding discussion. This methodology can be utilized in the design of virtually any turbomachinery system the user may encounter...|$|R
40|$|Periodontal mechanoreceptors signal {{information}} about tooth loads {{to the central}} nervous system and are considered to be important for the control of oral motor behaviors, like biting and chewing. Surprisingly, very {{little is known about the}} functional properties of periodontal mechanoreceptors at posterior teeth. In this thesis, the technique of microneurography was used on humans to record from single nerve fibers in the inferior alveolar nerve responding to forces applied to the teeth. The basic discharge patterns of human periodontal mechanoreceptors of posterior teeth were analyzed. Receptive field properties, directional sensitivity and encoding of force amplitude and rate were studied. Further, to evaluate the strength of the synaptic coupling between periodontal afferents (and other orofacial mechanoreceptive afferents) and jaw muscle motoneurones, the microneurography technique was combined with electromyography recordings. Finally, in behavioral experiments, the importance of periodontal mechanoreceptors in the regulation of force levels used to hold and split morsels between different types of teeth was attested. The present results indicate that the innervation of the periodontal ligament is weaker for the posterior teeth compared to the anterior teeth. When the posterior teeth were loaded, all periodontal afferents responded with a slowly adapting response, i. e., they all continued to discharge during sustained tooth loads in at least one direction. The teeth were stimulated in six different directions in the horizontal and vertical planes and the afferents typically responded in two to four of the six directions. However, distally along the dental arch, the afferents showed weaker sensitivity in the vertical directions and a bias in disto-lingual direction for the 1 st molar. When stimulating teeth adjacent to the receptor bearing tooth (RBT) about half of the afferents responded to loading of one or two more teeth. This is most likely due to transmission of forces to the RBT because of interdental contacts between the <b>teeth.</b> Thus, mechanical <b>coupling</b> between <b>teeth</b> rather than branching of single nerve fibers explains the multiple-tooth receptive fields. The majority of the afferents of posterior teeth exhibited a marked curved relationship between the steady-state discharge rate and the amplitude of the stimulated force, featuring a pronounced saturation tendency. Compared to afferents from anterior teeth, these afferents were less sensitive at low force levels. The afferents of posterior teeth were also characterized by a decline in the dynamic sensitivity with increasing force. A quantitative model based on this data revealed that these afferents poorly encode the magnitude of stronger chewing forces. However, a minority of the afferents showed a nearly linear stimulus-response relationship and a small decline in dynamic sensitivity with increased tooth load. Thus, this afferent group will continue to reflect the force profile during higher chewing forces. Strong synaptic coupling between single periodontal afferents and motoneurons of the jaw muscles demonstrated the importance of these receptors for a successful execution of oral function, like mastication. This coupling was mainly unilateral except for the central incisor. The use of periodontal afferent signals in controlling manipulative and power elements of a biting behavior was studied in a simple hold-and-split task using different types of teeth. The forces used to hold the morsel between the teeth increased distally along the dental arch. Importantly, the difference in hold forces for the various teeth could be explained by the different sensitivity characteristics of the periodontal afferents innervating anterior and posterior teeth. Blocking the sensory input from periodontal afferents increased the magnitude and variability of the hold forces for all types of teeth suggesting that periodontal afferent information is important for the fine motor regulation of the jaw when morsels are manipulated and positioned between the teeth to be prepared for chewing...|$|R
