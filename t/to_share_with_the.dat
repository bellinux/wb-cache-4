It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity. Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors {{would have liked to}} have kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a few studies which supportted {{alternative}} arrangements. One being a sister relationship between the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and spiral-horned antelopes. Historically the nilgai was classified as a tragelaphine by some scientists. Benirschke et al. (1980) work on karyotypes on the lesser kudu found the them <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nilgai in having their X chromosome in a fusion with autosome 14. Another study that analyzed the COII gene found the nilgai and lesser kudu being sister species (although the support was low and had limited species sampling). Majority of other molecular and morphological work {{do not support the}} placement of the nilgai in Tragelaphini, as it contradicts with their data and results.|$|E

500|$|Attanasio based the {{characters}} in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon's book. Frank Pembleton was based on Detective Harry Edgerton, although the two were so different that both the producers and detectives agreed their only true similarity {{was that they were}} black. Meldrick Lewis was only loosely based on Detective Donald Waltemeyer, and Levinson admitted Lewis did not start to become strongly developed until [...] because, [...] "I thought it'd be great to have a character who was totally unwilling <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> people he worked with." [...] Tim Bayliss was based on the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, the primary detective who investigated the 1988 Baltimore slaying of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace. The extremely personal approach Bayliss took in attempting to solve Adena Watson's murder, and his strong disappointment over failing to solve it, was based on the emotions Pellegrini went through in the Wallace case. Pellegrini provided advice to actor Kyle Secor about how to play the Bayliss role.|$|E
500|$|The {{cancellation}} of the sequel nearly ruined Double Fine, as they had invested all current efforts toward the title. Instead of a sequel, Double Fine began work on four smaller projects, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade (formerly titled Trenched) and , based on prototypes they had created from [...] "Amnesia Fortnights" [...] during the development period where they had lacked a publisher. In these two-weeks sessions, the Double Fine team was split into four groups and each tasked with creating a small prototype game <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the company; all four mini-games were well received internally. Upon hearing of the {{cancellation of}} the sequel, Schafer and his team began to promote these games around, {{and were able to}} obtain publishing deals for all four titles. The games {{will be able to take}} advantage of the custom game world engine and other assets they had created for Brütal Legend. The titles were considered financial successes, allowing Double Fine to recover and pursue further game development though steering away from major AAA releases.|$|E
500|$|Lat's {{works have}} been used in {{academic}} studies—the fields of which are diverse, spanning law, urban planning, and diets. The academics use his drawings to help them illustrate their points in a humorous yet educational manner. [...] Foreign embassy officials have sought Lat for his insight into the cultures of their societies. [...] They have invited him to tour their countries, in the hope that he will record his experiences in cartoon form <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world. The first country to do so was the United States, followed by others such as Australia, Germany, and Japan. [...] In 1998, Lat became the first cartoonist to be made an Eisenhower Fellow and revisited the United States; his research programme was the study of relationships among the many races in United States society. [...] In 2007, the National University of Malaysia awarded him an honorary Doctorate in Anthropology and Sociology. [...] Lat's works are recognised as visual records of Malaysia's cultural history; he was awarded a Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2002 for preserving Malay rural culture in his works.|$|E

However, his sense of loyalty prevents him from leaving an ailing firm and ailing fellows in the lurch. David returns {{to the office and}} tells Oscar and Wally of his settlement. He offers to pay the debts left from the Krayoxx fiasco, amounting to $200,000 and pays off the mortgage on the firm's office building, gives the loyal secretary Rochelle a $100,000 bonus and splits the remaining $1.2 million evenly with them (a far more generous settlement than they planned to give him, had the Krayoxx money come in). In return, the three of them are to sign a 12-month contract to enter an equal partnership and will no longer be an ambulance-chasing firm. A bit embarrassed, Oscar and Wally agree to the new contract. However, the two of them can't really function under these new terms, and later that year the partnership falls apart. Finley begins spending less time in the office and eventually retires a happy man, having recently remarried and being much more satisfied with his new wife, while Figg packs up and moves to Alaska. [...] Zinc opens his own product liability practice, David E. Zinc, Attorney-at-Law and hires Rochelle as his new secretary. Soon winning two further lead poisoning cases, he seems well embarked on a professionally and financially satisfying career.|$|E

The story received a nomination to the Hugo Award in 2011. The Thing Itself (2015), a novel by British author Adam Roberts, remixes The Thing with Kantian philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|Foragers collect {{food that}} {{is around the}} nesting area {{and bring it back}} to the colony <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other ants. [...] T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has {{multiple}} nests. Because of this, T. sessile is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce food transport cost. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the nest half-life was about 12.9 days.|$|E

Carr said that the combined state-federal probe was a success and that both teams worked well together. Years later, at the dedication of the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin, Carr recalled that the investigation into the Kennedy assassination was thorough and professional: [...] "It makes me sad that it [...] happened, but it doesn't make me sad <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> interested people of Texas about what this investigation revealed and how thorough it was and how nonpolitical it was." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Martin was {{a soldier}} in the Roman army and {{stationed}} in Gaul (modern-day France), he experienced a vision, which became the most-repeated story about his life. One day as he was approaching the gates of the city of Amiens, he met a scantily clad beggar. He impulsively cut his military cloak in half <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> man. That night, Martin dreamed of Jesus wearing the half-cloak he had given away. He heard Jesus say to the angels: [...] "Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed me with this robe." [...] (...) [...] In another version, when Martin woke, he found his cloak restored to wholeness. The dream confirmed Martin in his piety, and he was baptised at the age of 18.|$|E

Subsequently, interviewed by Gitta Sereny, researching her biography of Albert Speer, Luise alleged that in many instances the Allied prosecution made charges against Jodl based on documents that they refused <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> defense. Jodl nevertheless proved some of the charges made against him were untrue, such as the charge that he helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933. He was in one instance aided by a GI clerk who chose to give Luise a document showing that the execution {{of a group of}} British commandos in Norway had been legitimate. The GI warned Luise that if she didn't copy it immediately she would never see it again.|$|E
2500|$|Greenwood was {{centered}} on a street known as Greenwood Avenue.

Greenwood Avenue was home to the black American commercial district with many red brick buildings. These buildings belonged to black Americans and they were thriving businesses, including grocery stores, banks, libraries, and much more.
