5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a <b>Thermos</b> <b>flask).</b>|$|E
25|$|The No. 73 grenade, {{also known}} as the Thermos, Woolworth bomb, or hand {{percussion}} grenade, was a British anti-tank grenade used during the Second World War. It got its nickname from the resemblance to a <b>Thermos</b> <b>flask.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Uruguay, people {{commonly}} {{walk around}} the streets toting a mate and a thermos with hot water. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by yerba mate producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically {{for the purpose of}} drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a <b>thermos</b> <b>flask</b> and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.|$|E

2500|$|The No. 73 grenade had {{a roughly}} {{cylindrical}} shape and plastic screw-on cap, {{similar to that}} of a <b>Thermos</b> <b>flask,</b> from which the 'Thermos bomb' nickname was derived. It was approximately [...] in diameter and [...] in length, and weighed [...] Its explosive content consisted of [...] of polar ammonal gelatine dynamite or nitrogelatine – both of which were easily flammable and could be detonated by the impact of small-arms fire. When thrown at a tank or other vehicle, a weighted tape held in the users hand unravelled and pulled free a safety pin, which was attached to a Type 247 [...] "All-ways" [...] fuze (the same type used in the Gammon bomb and No 69 grenade); this armed and then detonated the grenade. Its weight meant that it could only be thrown short distances, limiting its range to between , and its detonation could injure the user if they did not find cover before it detonated. It was able to penetrate [...] of armour, and [...] "damage severely any light tank." [...] It was best used against the tracks of a tank, which it could easily blow off and force its crew to waste time by stopping and repairing it.|$|E

50|$|Max Perutz gave {{an account}} of a similar {{incident}} in his book I Wish I Made You Angry Earlier. A demonstration of pykrete was given at Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) by a naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Douglas Grant, who was provided by Perutz with rods of ice and pykrete packed with dry ice in <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks</b> and large blocks of ice and pykrete. Grant demonstrated the comparative strength of ice and pykrete by firing bullets into both blocks: the ice shattered, but the bullet rebounded from the pykrete and hit the Chief of the Imperial Staff (Sir Alan Brooke) in the shoulder. Brooke was unhurt.|$|R

5000|$|French presses {{are more}} {{portable}} and self-contained than other coffee makers. Travel mug versions exist, {{which are made}} of tough plastic instead of the more common glass, and have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole. Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers not wishing to carry a heavy, metal percolator or a filter using drip brew. Other versions include stainless steel, insulated presses designed to keep the coffee hot, similar in design to <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks.</b> One variation uses a [...] "pull" [...] design: the coffee grounds are placed in a mesh basket, which is then pulled into the lid after brewing, trapping the grounds out of the coffee. Others produce a similar effect by having shutters that can be closed via {{the top of the}} press, sealing the grounds off from the coffee entirely. French presses are also sometimes used to make cold brew coffee.|$|R
60|$|Slowly, {{with two}} engines, we grunt and chuff and twist {{to get over}} the break-neck heights that shut Messina in from the north coast. The windows are opaque with steam and drops of rain.

60|$|Fill {{the little}} bag {{we call the}} kitchenino. Methylated spirit, a small {{aluminium}} saucepan, a spirit-lamp, two spoons, two forks, a knife, two aluminium plates, salt, sugar, tea--what else? The <b>thermos</b> <b>flask,</b> the various sandwiches, four apples, and a little tin of butter. So much for the kitchenino, for myself and the queen bee. Then my knapsack and the q-b's handbag.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Bickley {{had poured}} {{out some of}} the hot coffee laced with brandy into the cup that was screwed {{on the top of the}} <b>thermos</b> <b>flask.</b> Advancing to the man whom I supported, he put it to his lips. He tasted and made a wry face, but {{presently}} he began to sip, and ultimately swallowed it all. The effect of the stimulant was wonderful, for in a few minutes he came to life completely and was even able to sit up without support.|$|E
40|$|INFUSIONS of haemopoietic {{cells have}} now been widely used in the {{treatment}} of various forms of marrow failure. These cells have generally been obtained from an adult living donor (Mathe et al., 1959), or from the patient before either chemotherapy (Westbury et al., 1959) or radiotherapy (Newtoii et al., 1959) for reinfusion after these procedures. Kay and Constandoulakis (1959) have described a technique whereby the haemopoietic cells contained in the human foetal liver may be harvested, prepared, and stored in a form suitable for intravenous infusion. This communication describes the results obtained in treating fifteen patients suffering from marrow failure with this material. MATERIALS AND METHODS The foetal liver suspensions were kindly supplied to us by Dr. H. E. M. Kay of The Royal Marsden Hospital, London.

40|$|Evaluation of {{cold chain}} system {{was done in}} a time bound study during August and September months of 1992 in two districts of Haryana as there were {{frequent}} breakdowns of icelined refrigerators during the previous year. The study revealed that defective stablizers and electricity plugs and sockets were the reason of breakdown in many cases. Temperature maintenance and functioning of deep freezers was satisfactory. Retrospective analysis showed that the polio vaccine samples picked up during 1990 - 92 {{were found to be}} satisfactory by CRI, Kasauli. Use of two ice-pick carrier and <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks</b> was associated with poor temperature maintenance. Seven vaccine carriers out of 25 examined had crakced wall lining. Lids of carriers were also not kept tight during vaccination sessions. Response lag of the health workers and medical officers in case of breakdowns was delayed. A one day refresher course exclusively on cold chain maintenance at community health centre level is recommended...|$|R
50|$|Rice {{is brought}} in by Captain Stuart (Michael Gough) to help {{solve the problem of}} small booby-trapped {{explosive}} devices (mines) being dropped by Nazi bombers, which have killed four people, including three children. They receive some useful information from a critically wounded young soldier (Bryan Forbes in his debut). Two further mines are found at Chesil Beach: they look like common <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks.</b> Stuart is first on the scene but has difficulty getting Rice on the telephone in his flat because Rice is alone following his breakup, angry, drunk and destructive. Rice quickly sobers up, and travels to Chesil Beach only to find that Stuart tried to defuse one of the mines and has been blown up. Rice sets to work on the second mine after listening to the notes Stuart dictated to an ATS corporal (Renée Asherson) during his effort earlier in the day. He discovers that the mine has two booby traps, not one, and manages to defuse them both.|$|R
60|$|So Bickley and I said to each other, and yet {{presently}} {{he changed}} his mind and in a special metal machine carefully made some extremely strong black coffee which he poured into a <b>thermos</b> <b>flask,</b> previously warmed with hot water, adding thereto about a claret glass of brandy. Also he extracted certain drugs from his medicine-chest, and with them, as I noted, a hypodermic syringe, which he first boiled in a kettle and then shut up in a little tube with a glass stopper.|$|E
60|$|I, of course, in a rage. The q-b {{stares at}} every rag and stitch, and crosses and re-crosses this infernal dark stream of a Via Maqueda, which, as I have said, is choked solid with {{strollers}} and carriages. Be it remembered that I have {{on my back}} the brown knapsack, and the q-b carries the kitchenino. This {{is enough to make}} a travelling menagerie of us. If I had my shirt sticking out behind, and if the q-b had happened merely to catch up the table-cloth and wrap it round her as she came out, all well and good. But a big brown knapsack! And a basket with <b>thermos</b> <b>flask,</b> etc! No, one could not expect such things to pass in a southern capital.|$|E
60|$|Next {{he pointed}} to the metal cup out of which he had drunk. Bickley filled it again from the <b>thermos</b> <b>flask,</b> which I {{observed}} excited his keen interest, for, having touched the flask with his hand and found that it was cool, he appeared to marvel that the fluid coming from it should be hot and steaming. Presently he smiled as though he had got the clue to the mystery, and swallowed his second drink of coffee and spirit. This done, he motioned to us to lift the lid of the lady's coffin, pointing out a certain catch in the bolts which at first we could not master, for it will be remembered that on this coffin these were shot.|$|E

When I arrived at Abbey Road there were girls everywhere with <b>Thermos</b> <b>flasks,</b> cakes, sandwiches, waiting for the Beatles to come out. - Anil Bhagwat, 1988 According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by the interplay between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later recalled of his involvement: [...] "George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} cold water extraction, {{incorporation}} of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and aluminium sulphate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3) on the setting time (t max), maximum hydration temperature (T max), time ratio (t R) and surface chemistry of Eremospatha macrocarpa and Laccosperma secundiflorum particles mixed with Portland cement was investigated. The mixtures were placed in thermally sealed <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks</b> for 24 h after which t max, T max and t R were measured. The t max, T max and t R were 12. 4 and 11. 9 h, 59. 1 and 58. 3 C, 1. 1 and 1. 1, respectively for untreated E. macrocarpa and L. secundiflorum and ranged from 5. 2 to 10. 7 h, 57. 7 to 83. 7 C and 0. 5 to 0. 9, respectively when treated with cold water and chemical additives. Cold water extraction and chemical additives significantly improved the hydration parameters of rattan-cement system. CaCl 2 performed better as a chemical accelerator than Al 2 (SO 4) 3 while L. secundiflorum inhibited cement setting more than E. macrocarpa. Infrared spectroscopy showed that incorporation of CaCl 2 to L. secundiflorum particles helped expose cellulose to advance participation thereby enlarging its surface area for interpenetration networking with cement...|$|R

Rumen fluid was collected before morning feeding from two ruminally fistulated kajang goats, that were fed concentrate as a supplement and rice straw ad libitum twice daily at 0730 and 1700  hours. Rumen fluid was pumped from the rumen with a manually operated vacuum pump and transferred into two pre-warmed <b>thermos</b> <b>flasks,</b> transported to the laboratory, combined, filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and flushed with CO 2. Rumen fluid was added to the buffered mineral solution with constant stirring, while maintained in a water bath at 39  °C. About 30  ml of buffered rumen fluid was added into syringes containing the samples. Air bubble was removed, clip was closed, the initial volume was recorded and the syringe placed in a water bath at 39  °C. Treatments were incubated in triplicates and two runs were carried out. Gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48  h. At the end of incubation period (48  h), pH was measured.|$|R
