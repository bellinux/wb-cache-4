5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, {{it was possible for}} them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscription}} {{created a}} sensation as it mentions four distant countries {{that were the}} targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same patina as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal r-rune with an open side stroke, something which is usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> expert on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was grikir.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him {{to work on the}} case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E

25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. <b>There</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, and <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> doubt {{that the federal government}} intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.|$|E
25|$|India's Home Minister, Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, {{during his}} visit to Srinagar in 1956, {{declared}} that the State of Jammu and Kashmir {{was an integral part of}} India and <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> question of a plebiscite to determine its status afresh, hinting that India would resist plebiscite efforts from then on.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, through the 18th century, John Locke and David Hume {{developed}} Descartes' {{line of thought}} still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction, proposing that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The Waite Court heard twenty-four {{original}} habeas petitions {{in criminal}} matters. Many of these rulings {{held that the}} original habeas jurisdiction did not extend {{to the type of}} case presented. The general rule, articulated in several cases, was that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> post-conviction original habeas jurisdiction unless the court below was totally without jurisdiction (for example, if the criminal statute were unconstitutional).|$|E
25|$|The {{conservative}} wing in the Russian Orthodox Church criticized Kirill for practicing ecumenism {{throughout the}} 1990s. In 2008, breakaway Bishop Diomid of Anadyr and Chukotka criticized him for associating {{himself with the}} Catholic Church. However, in a recent statement, Kirill stated that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> doctrinal compromise with the Catholic Church, and that discussions with them {{did not have the}} goal of seeking unification.|$|E
25|$|In March 1923, de Valera {{attended}} {{the meeting of}} the IRA Army Executive to decide {{on the future of the}} war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities. The leader of the Free State, W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> acceptance of a surrender without disarming.|$|E

25|$|In November 1912, Nerman {{attended}} the special emergency {{convention of the}} Socialist International, which had been summoned to Basel in Switzerland, due to {{the outbreak of the}} Balkan Wars.

With a united international working class, they stated, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more wars.|$|E
25|$|For {{politically}} aware Englishmen, Parliament had essentially {{elected a}} king. Although officially he was supreme, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{doubt that the}} Commons had picked the king and could pick another instead. Although there was now a law demanding that all swear allegiance to the monarch {{as head of the}} church, it became less and less clear why the nation was to be so intolerant.|$|E
25|$|Although hybrids {{may have}} a weight up to 60kg (supposedly even up to 70kg), most hybrids do not weigh more than 20kg, which is {{considered}} to be within the normal range for dingoes. Furthermore, during breeding-experiments <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> differences in growth patterns of dingoes and similar sized crossbreeds found. Additionally, the average age of wild living domestic dogs in Australia is also not higher than what is considered normal for dingoes.|$|E
