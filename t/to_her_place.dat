5|$|During the modernization, four of her 15cm {{guns were}} removed and two 8.8cm guns were added. All twelve 1-pounder guns were removed, {{as was the}} ship's stern-mounted torpedo tube. Kaiser Barbarossas {{superstructure}} was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts. The ship's funnels were also lengthened. Kaiser Barbarossas modernization was completed by 1 October 1907, when she was recommissioned for service. By that time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. Consequently, the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet). Kaiser Barbarossa returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>place</b> in the I Squadron and she participated in the normal routine of divisional, squadron, and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year. The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the Azores and returned to Kiel on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September.|$|E

2500|$|The Fates are {{depicted}} as beautiful, nude goddesses spinning {{the thread of}} Marie de' Medici's destiny; their presence at Marie's birth assures her prosperity and success as a ruler that is unveiled in the cycle's subsequent panels. In Greek and Roman mythology, one Fate spun the thread, another measured its length, and the third cut the thread. [...] In Rubens' depiction, however, the scissors necessary for this cutting are omitted, stressing the privileged and immortal character of the Queen's life. The last panel of the cycle, in accordance with this theme, illustrates Queen Marie rising up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>place</b> as queen of heaven, having achieved her lifelong goal of immortality through eternal fame.|$|E
2500|$|Pocahontas was the {{daughter}} of Powhatan, [...] paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of about thirty Algonquian-speaking groups and petty chiefdoms in Tidewater, Virginia. Her mother's name and origins are unknown but she was probably of lowly status.

In the traditional histories of the Powhatan, Pocahontas' mother died in childbirth.
