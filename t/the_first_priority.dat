5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed {{greater emphasis on}} conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E

5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain, but with {{diagonal}} cell blocks replaced with a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority.</b> Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E

5|$|As a result, Lindwall was {{selected}} as part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up {{to the start of}} the tour. Lindwall was carrying an injured leg tendon and his foot drag in the delivery stride led to murmurings in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who had Lindwall's leg back to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front. Bradman stated his firm belief that Lindwall's delivery was fair. During the lengthy boat journey to England, Bradman emphasized to Lindwall the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual, to avoid being no-balled, and to avoid bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his action. Bradman assured Lindwall that he was an automatic selection for the Tests even if he did not take a wicket in the lead-in tour matches, telling him that being passed by the umpires was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority.</b> Bradman recalled how Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 tour, destroying his confidence. Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and so it remained for the rest of the tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority,</b> and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E
5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

25|$|Salafists such as ISIL {{believe that}} only a {{legitimate}} authority can undertake the leadership of jihad, and that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society.

25|$|Royer {{attended}} the first International Congress on Woman’s Rights in 1878 {{but did not}} speak. For the Congress in 1889 she was asked by Maria Deraismes, to chair the historical section.

Similar elitist views were held by many French feminists at the time who feared a return to the monarchy with its strong links to the conservative Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
50|$|Historically, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> of Japanese railway {{planners}} was {{to build}} a line from Tokyo to the Kansai region, either following the Tokaido route or the northern Nakasendō route.

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of France the High Command (OKW) felt they had won the war, and some more {{pressure}} would persuade Britain. On 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his paper setting out options: the first was to increase attacks on shipping, economic targets and the RAF: air attacks and food shortages were expected to break morale and lead to capitulation. Destruction of the RAF was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority,</b> and invasion would be a last resort. Hermann Göring's operational directive issued the same day ordered destruction of the RAF {{to clear the way}} for attacks cutting off seaborne supplies to Britain.

25|$|The popular {{conception}} of the Bauhaus {{as the source of}} extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig and particularly Ernst May, as the city architects of Berlin, Dresden and Frankfurt respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in Weimar Germany. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop Onkel Toms Hütte, is still occupied.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich {{has argued}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> for {{immigration}} reform is tighter border control. He has pushed for Congress {{to pass a}} narrowly written emergency border bill to finish the border fence between the United States and Mexico {{in less than a}} year and have complete border control within two years. In addition to greater border control, Gingrich has advocated for measures to discourage the hiring and harboring of illegal immigrants, such as shifting Internal Revenue Service resources to audit companies that employ illegal immigrants and cutting off federal aid to cities, counties or states that refuse to enforce immigration laws. He has frequently argued for using credit card companies to develop identification cards and a real-time system to verify citizenship.|$|E
