40|$|Assaying {{internal}} contamination due to inhalation {{is a primary}} concern in developing emergency procedures related to Radioactive Dispersal Devices (RDD). One method of determining {{internal contamination}} makes use of a common medical instrument, a Thyroid Uptake System (TUS). The TUS used in this research has two collimators a thyroid uptake collimator and a bioassay collimator. Both collimators were considered and modeled in MCNP {{to be used in}} conjunction with six MIRD-type (Medical Internal Radiation Dose) phantoms. The collimators were placed in four positions on the phantoms the front right lung, the back right lung, the neck, and the <b>thigh.</b> <b>Unit</b> sources of Cs- 137, Co- 60, I- 131, Ir- 192, Am- 241, and Sr/Y- 90 were placed in the organs of the phantoms. MCNP particle tallies were performed over the detector crystal volume to determine the count-rate contributions from the unit source in each organ. Biokinetic modeling was performed using DCAL (Dose and Risk Calculation System) to generate coefficients to describe activity as a function of time in various organs. By folding the count-rate results with the organ concentrations, the detector response as a function of time after intake has been determined. This work was performed under funding provided by the Radiation Studies Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. M. S.

40|$|After {{injury to}} an {{anterior}} cruciate ligament assessment is difficult {{because there is no}} established and objective test of anterior instability. We have developed a new apparatus to measure this instability; in this paper we describe the apparatus and our investigation of its accuracy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The apparatus consists of two linked parts: the <b>thigh</b> fixing <b>unit</b> and the calf-holding unit (Fig. 1). The <b>thigh</b> fixing <b>unit</b> is based on a chair (1) attached to a heavy steel frame and adjustable vertically or horizontally. The distal thigh just above the patella is clamped to the chair by four adjustable metal shells (2), each with a sand-filled pad. The chairback can be tilted to allow the subject to recline and to relax his hamstring muscles. The calf-holding unit consistsof a frame which can be adjusted for angle, a calf holder (shaded in Fig. 1), which is mobile in an anteroposterior direction in its proximal part only. It has adjustable clamps with four sand-filled pads to hold the proximal end of the tibia (3). Distally, it has a hinged foot-holder which allows free rotation of the tibia (4) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduated {{compression}} stockings (CS) {{are used}} to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT); however, there is little known about the nursing practices surrounding their use in intensive care units (ICUs). This descriptive survey of adult ICUs in Australia sought to identify the nursing practices {{associated with the use}} of CS. A total of 91 (89 % response rate) ICUs - 68 (75 %) public and 23 (25 %) private - responded. CS were used in conjunction with anticoagulants in 88 (97 %) units and with sequential compression devices (SCDs) in 48 (53 %) units. Knee length CS were used most frequently (n= 37, 41 %); however, 31 (34 %) units used both knee and <b>thigh.</b> Most <b>units</b> (n= 80, 95 %) allocated new CS for each patient and most (n= 72, 79 %) allocated one pair of CS per patient. Correct sizing was determined by the use of a tape measure in 74 (88 %) of the units. CS were washed by hand in 74 (88 %) units. A total of 67 (74 %) of the units reported that unit protocol or tradition was a factor in determining CS use, whereas 45 (50 %) reported that research evidence was also a factor. These findings suggest that while Australian ICUs are demonstrating best practices in relation to certain CS practices, Australian standards for linen and other manufacturing guidelines and are not being followed.
