40|$|A double-quantum-dot {{coupled to}} {{electrodes}} with spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias) is investigated theoretically {{by means of}} the Green's functions formalism. By applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1) can be manipulated in a fully electrical manner. To noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1, it is proposed that <b>the</b> second quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2) is weakly coupled to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1. In <b>the</b> presence of the exchange interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> polarized spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 behaves like an effective magnetic field and weakly polarizes the spin in <b>the</b> nearby quantum <b>dot</b> 2. By applying a very small spin bias to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2, <b>the</b> spin-dependent transport through <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2 can be probed, allowing the spin polarization in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 to be identified nondestructively.

Henry Sugarman, {{of the latter}} organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all-black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said the circle represents eternity and unity and <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> are art, science, and religion (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness of time and <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with inlays of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans was a letter from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors.|$|E

5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal.

The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E

5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E

40|$|The slalom {{illusion}} is {{the condition}} whereby the straight trajectory of a dot crossing {{a pattern of}} tilted lines is perceived as being sinusoidal (Cesaro and Agostini, 1998). The authors suggested that this illusion {{might be due to}} a local distortion of <b>the</b> moving <b>dot</b> when traversing each tilted line: When <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> approaches <b>the</b> lines, its trajectory is distorted toward the normalization, that is, <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> bends to enter the line perpendicularly (Swanson, 1984). Furthermore, there might be a perceptual tendency of <b>the</b> moving <b>dot</b> to continue along this virtual trajectory. However, as the physical trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is straight, <b>the</b> final perceived trajectory is a compromise between the virtual and the physical trajectory. In the present experiment, we test this hypothesis by manipulating the area between the tilted lines. The area between the lines was either a) the same colour as <b>the</b> <b>dot,</b> to make <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> trajectory partially invisible; or (b) empty, leaving <b>the</b> <b>dot's</b> full trajectory visible. Results show that the illusion magnitude increases when <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> trajectory is partially invisible, supporting the hypothesis that the illusion results from a compromise between the physical and the virtual trajectory...|$|R
