5|$|Most residents, {{including}} the mayor, supported the parliamentarians during the English Civil War, although its military governor, Colonel Goring, supported the royalists. The town {{became a major}} base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the Siege of Portsmouth; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist garrison in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in Gosport joined in the assault, with their guns damaging St Thomas's Church. On 5September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up with gunpowder. In return, he and his garrison were allowed safe passage.|$|E
5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up, taking the money with him.|$|E

25|$|The French {{troops who}} {{occupied}} Moscow in 1812 used {{the church for}} stables and looted anything worth taking.

The interiors were repaired in 1813, and the exterior in 1816. Instead of replacing missing ceramic tiles of the main tent, the Church preferred to simply cover it with a tin roof.|$|E

25|$|On 10 April, the {{remaining}} mutineers fired on Valletta, though they caused no injury. Villettes then ordered that the fort be stormed. A party of 40 men under Lieutenant de Clermont, who was himself {{part of the}} Froberg Regiment, scaled the fort and took control of it, taking no losses in the process. The fort fell but six rebels retreated into the gunpowder magazine, threatening <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up. After two days, they blew up the magazine's 600 barrels of gunpowder, and killed three British sentries. In the ensuing confusion the six rebels managed to escape to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|Kabalin {{was sent}} to the 1st Airborne Corps. He spent 1942 in {{training}} in the Teykovo area. On 8 December, the corps became the 1st Guards Airborne Division and Kabalin became a squad leader in the new unit. In February 1943, he fought in the Battle of Demyansk. On 13 March, Kabalin and 12 other paratroopers were dropped behind German lines with the task of blowing up a bridge over the Lovat River. The men reached the bridge after moving 10 kilometers in two days. The men began the attack at night after Kabalin reportedly killed the German sentry and then along with seven others engaged in a diversionary raid on the barracks, while the remaining four laid explosives under the bridge. The four soldiers at the bridge were involved in a firefight but were able <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up. Of Kabalin's group, only three survived and Kabalin was wounded. The 1st Guards Airborne Division soon began its offensive to the Lovat and Redya Rivers and Kabalin and his group were able to link up with the division. He was immediately sent to a field hospital and awarded the Order of the Red Star on 10 April.|$|E

On October 8, 1990, Israeli forces patrolling the site blocked worshippers from accessing it. A tear gas canister was detonated among the female worshippers, which caused events to escalate. On 12 October 1990 Palestinian Muslims protested violently the intention of some extremist Jews to lay a cornerstone on the site for a New Temple {{as a prelude to}} the destruction of the Muslim mosques. The attempt was blocked by Israeli authorities but demonstrators were widely reported as having stoned Jews at the Western Wall. According to Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi, investigative journalism has shown this allegation to be false. Rocks were eventually thrown, while security forces fired rounds that ended up killing 21 people and injuring 150 more. An Israeli inquiry found Israeli forces at fault, but it also concluded that charges could not be brought against any particular individuals. In December 1997, Israeli security services preempted an attempt by Jewish extremists to throw a pig's head wrapped {{in the pages of the}} Quran into the area, in order to spark a riot and embarrass the government.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

[...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think the first time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> off as another animated show that's trying too hard.

500|$|The {{origins of}} the pipe organ {{can be traced back}} to the water organ in Ancient Greece, in the 3rd century BC, in which the wind supply was created with water pressure. By the 6th or 7th century AD, bellows were used to supply organs with wind. Beginning in the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex {{instrument}} capable of producing different timbres. A pipe organ with [...] "great leaden pipes" [...] was sent to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V as a gift to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, in 757. [...] Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning the pipe organ's establishment in Western church music. [...] In England, [...] "The first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in Winchester Cathedral in the 10th century. It was a huge machine with 400 pipes, which needed two men to play it and 70 men <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it,</b> and its sound could be heard throughout the city." [...] By the 17th century, most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed. From that time, the pipe organ was the most complex man-made device - a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Sucker Punch are {{highlighted}} with orchestrations and a rock edge.

[...] The versions of the songs tried to match the action on-screen: Bates detailed that [...] "White Rabbit" [...] "starts out very ethereal, getting [...] into the mindset of the dance, and once the girls have their assignment, once they delve in with machineguns and other weapons, the song starts to bloom into this epic, rich, full orchestral choral fanfare." [...] This correspondence lead to the tracks getting longer and alternating between the songs themselves and [...] "a score that is reminiscent of songs sometimes", which Bates described as [...] "playing in the consciousness of the characters [...]" [...] For instance, [...] "White Rabbit" [...] features a choir of 150 voices playing the vocal melody of the first verse of the song, and tracks such as [...] "Search & Destroy" [...] have [...] "moments where Zach really wanted <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>it</b> up into [...] huge orchestra".|$|E
