5|$|Earlier common {{throughout}} deciduous {{forests in}} India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers. Their numbers were estimated at slightly above 10,000 in 2001, and are feared to be decreasing. In Mudumalai National Park, the populations are low and scattered. Their numbers in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes {{in the same}} location put <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> above 1000. Densities of above 0.7 individuals per km2 have been considered as being healthy. Presently the four-horned antelope is confined to the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. The range in India covers a vast expanse, from {{the foothills of the}} Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations are in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepal.|$|E

25|$|The rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} flitting among dense cover {{but also in}} more open {{positions}} on trees, the tops of bushes and on posts. It is frequently seen on the ground hopping about and flaring and bobbing its tail up and down. When perched it also displays its tail in this way and also sometimes droops its wings before giving <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flick forward. It feeds mainly on the ground on insects such as beetles, grasshoppers and the larvae of butterflies and moths, and on earthworms, turning over the leaf litter to find its prey.|$|E

25|$|When Robert left Molesme {{to avoid}} what he {{perceived}} to be the abbey's increasing wealth and overly strong connections to the aristocracy, Harding and Alberic of Cîteaux went with him. Seeing no hope of a sufficient reformation in Molesme, Robert appointed another abbot for the abbey and then, with Alberic, Harding, and twenty-one other monks, received permission from Hugh, the Archbishop of Lyons and legate of the Holy See, to found a new monastery in Citeaux, a marshy wilderness five leagues from Dijon. There, they formed a new, more austere monastery. Eudes, afterwards Duke of Burgundy, built <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> church which was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin, as all the churches of the Cistercians from that time have been.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} , which are called moose. The shape of these, and the varied {{color of their}} skins, is much like roes, but in size they surpass <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and are {{destitute}} of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down {{for the purpose of}} rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that {{the upper part of the}} trees may appear to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with them.|$|E

They conceded two early goals, but [...] "kept up a strong pressure" [...] thereafter, and the Birmingham Daily Post {{suggested}} that [...] "the forwards played magnificently, and had the half-backs supported <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more efficiently they might have broken down even the stalwart defence" [...] of the home club. The Nottinghamshire Guardian had predicted that Forest [...] "should have but little difficulty in disposing of Small Heath", but later admitted that the latter [...] "gave the Forest a far better game than had generally been anticipated." ...|$|E
500|$|Raimi famously enjoyed [...] "torturing" [...] his actors. Raimi {{believed}} that to capture pain and anger in his actors, {{he had to}} abuse <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at times, saying, [...] "if everyone was in extreme pain and misery, that would translate into a horror." [...] Producer Robert Tapert agreed with Raimi, commenting that he [...] "enjoyed when an actor bleeds." [...] While shooting a scene with Campbell running down a hill, Campbell tripped and injured his leg. Raimi enjoyed poking Campbell's injury with a stick he found in the woods. Because of the copious amounts {{of blood in the}} film, the crew produced gallons of fake blood with karo syrup. It took Campbell hours to remove the sticky substance from himself. Several actors had inadvertently been stabbed or thrown into objects during production.|$|E
500|$|Fellow judge James L. Oakes {{described}} Medina as a {{fair and}} reasonable judge, and wrote that [...] "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of their own medicine, too." [...] Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was [...] "unfriendly" [...] to the defense, and that [...] "there {{is reason to believe}} that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: [...] "If we let them do that sort of thing , they'll destroy the government". According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had {{died of a heart attack}} during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.|$|E

500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When {{we were talking about the}} conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} won awards {{and met with}} overall {{positive}} reviews from video game journalists. Upon its release, IGN labeled it as an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] and awarded it [...] "Game of the Month" [...] for the Nintendo DS, citing the game as a [...] "great achievement" [...] of the system's capability. In 2005, the game won a Golden Joystick Award for best handheld game of year. Prior to the game's release, Craig Harris of IGN reviewed the early demonstration. He commented on the accurate recreation of the original graphics, and stated that the small Nintendo DS screen helps hide any visual flaws. Harris criticized the game's controls calling <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "sluggish" [...] and [...] "clumsy". Though he praised the graphics and new gameplay additions, Harris expressed disappointment that the Mario launch title for the new system was a remake instead of a full game. IGN's Anoop Gantayat anticipated the game {{would be a big}} hit among American video game enthusiasts. In Japan, Famitsu ranked Super Mario 64 DS the 29th most wanted title.|$|E
500|$|According to {{survivor}} accounts, {{before dawn}} on August 15 the H Company mortar platoon {{became aware of}} enemy activity near Hill 303. The platoon leader telephoned G Company, 5th Cavalry, which informed him a platoon of 60 South Korean troops would come to reinforce the mortar platoon. Later {{in the morning the}} platoon saw two North Korean T-34s followed by 200 or more enemy soldiers on the road below <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> later a group of Koreans appeared on the slope. A patrol going to meet the climbing Korean troops called out and received in reply a blast of gunfire from automatic weapons. The mortar platoon leader, Lt. Jack Hudspeth, believed they were friendly. Some of the Americans realized that the advancing troops were North Korean and were going to open up on them according to former Pvt. Fred Ryan and Pvt. Roy Manring, when they revisited the old mortar position in 1999. Hudspeth ordered them not to fire and threatened them with a court-martial if they did. The rest of the watching Americans were not convinced that the new arrivals were enemy soldiers until the red stars became visible on their field caps. By that time, they were extremely close to the American positions. The North Korean troops came right up to the foxholes without either side firing a shot. Hudspeth ordered his platoon to surrender without a fight as it was far outnumbered and outgunned. The North Koreans quickly took [...] the mortarmen captive. Estimates of the number captured range from 31 to 42.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first full episode of the show that Daniels wrote. The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was [...] "very excited and intrigued" [...] with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would [...] "step up" [...] and [...] "throw himself into it". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to [...] "bring it back" [...] to character and story, unlike the previous season which got [...] "so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags". Mirkin added: [...] "I explored the characters a little more, took <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further. I had one of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, [...] "The Last Temptation of Homer", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, [...] "Bart's Girlfriend", plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals." [...] Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a [...] "wonderful crew" [...] on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a [...] "wonderful" [...] director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did [...] "fine animation throughout".|$|E
500|$|Deprived of {{political}} power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write {{and work on}} physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks {{about the history of}} science, the role of science in society, {{and the nature of the}} universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President John F. Kennedy awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 as a gesture {{of political}} rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> over a week after Kennedy's assassination, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, presented Oppenheimer with the award, [...] "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: [...] "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today." [...] The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss' political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.|$|E
