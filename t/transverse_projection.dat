25|$|The iris flower is of {{interest}} {{as an example of}} the relation between flowering plants and pollinating insects. The shape of the flower and the position of the pollen-receiving and stigmatic surfaces on the outer petals form a landing-stage for a flying insect, which in probing for nectar, will first come into contact with the perianth, then with the stigmatic stamens in one whorled surface which is borne on an ovary formed of three carpels. The shelf-like <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> on the inner whorled underside of the stamens is beneath the overarching style arm below the stigma, so that the insect comes in contact with its pollen-covered surface only after passing the stigma; in backing out of the flower it will come in contact only with the non-receptive lower face of the stigma. Thus, an insect bearing pollen from one flower will, in entering a second, deposit the pollen on the stigma; in backing out of a flower, the pollen which it bears will not be rubbed off on the stigma of the same flower.|$|E

50|$|In {{constructing}} a map on any projection, a sphere is normally chosen {{to model the}} Earth when {{the extent of the}} mapped region exceeds a few hundred kilometers in length in both dimensions. For maps of smaller regions, an ellipsoidal model must be chosen if greater accuracy is required; see next section. The spherical form of the transverse Mercator projection was one of the seven 'new' projections presented, in 1772, by Johann Heinrich Lambert. (The text is also available in a modern English translation.) Lambert did not name his projections; the name transverse Mercator dates from {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century. The principal properties of the <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> are here presented in comparison with the properties of the normal projection.|$|E

50|$|Sinosaurosphargis is a basal marine reptile, {{closely related}} to Saurosphargis from the Lower Muschelkalk of southwestern Poland and eastern Netherlands. Sinosaurosphargis {{possesses}} retracted external nostrils, and shows closed upper temporal fenestrae, and a ventrally open cheek. Its trunk region is short and rounded, and covered by a shield composed of small osteoderms, just like its neck and the proximal portions of all four limbs. Its back vertebrae show elongated, distally expanded <b>transverse</b> <b>projections.</b> The chest ribs are broadened and flat, contacting one another along their length, and forming a closed chest rib basket. Li et al. (2014) found some of these traits to be shared with all saurosphargids, while others are exclusive to Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis. These genera have broader and flatter rib baskets than basal saurosphargids like Largocephalosaurus, and also <b>transverse</b> <b>projections</b> of back vertebrae and proximal portions of chest ribs that are much more robust, being much wider than the spacing between them.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1845, The Geelong Advertiser {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} fossils found near Geelong, under the headline [...] "Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal". This was a continuation of a story on 'fossil remains' from the previous issue. The newspaper continued, [...] "On the bone being shown to an intelligent black (sic), he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen. On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation." [...] The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip and the [...] "most direct evidence of all" [...] - that of a man named Mumbowran [...] "who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal". The account provided this description of the creature: The Bunyip, then, is represented as uniting {{the characteristics of a}} bird and of an alligator. It has a head resembling an emu, with a long bill, at the extremity of which is a <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> on each side, with serrated edges like the bone of the stingray. Its body and legs partake {{of the nature of the}} alligator. The hind legs are remarkably thick and strong, and the fore legs are much longer, but still of great strength. The extremities are furnished with long claws, but the blacks say its usual method of killing its prey is by hugging it to death. When in the water it swims like a frog, and when on shore it walks on its hind legs with its head erect, in which position it measures twelve or thirteen feet in height.|$|E

40|$|The {{interference}} fragmentation function translates {{the fragmentation}} of a quark with a <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> of the spin into an azimuthal asymmetry of two final-state hadrons. In e+e- annihilation the product of two interference fragmentation functions is measured. We report nonzero asymmetries for pairs of charge-ordered pi+pi- pairs, which indicate a significant interference fragmentation function in this channel. The results are obtained from a 672 fb- 1 data sample that contains 711 Ã— 106 pi+pi- pairs and was collected at and near the ?(4 S) resonance, with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.

A correct jet energy scale is therefore essential to the success of the ATLAS experiment. In this thesis the missing <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> fraction method is used to measure the absolute jet response in Z+jet events where the Z decays into a pair of leptons. This measurement complements similar measurements made using Î³+jet events while extending the calibration to lower energies. The possibility of taking advantage of the differing fraction of events in each sample with gluon-initiated jets as a method for deriving a parton-dependent jet response is also explored. Preliminary results are shown to agree with Monte Carlo predictions within their statistical uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} (or electric) {{fields of}} morphology-dependent resonances of a dielectric sphere are shown {{to form an}} orthogonal complete set for expanding divergence-free vectorial functions inside the dielectric sphere, provided {{that there is a}} spatial discontinuity in its refractive index, say, {{at the edge of the}} sphere. A <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> dyad that picks up the divergence-free part (or its generalization) of a vector is defined and shown to be expandable in terms of the magnetic (or electric) fields of these morphology-dependent resonances. More-over, the transverse dyadic Green's function in these dielectric spheres is in turn expressed as a sum of tensor products of relevant morphology-dependent resonance fields. Each term in the sum manifests itself as a resonant response to external perturbations. Thus the morphology-dependent resonance expansion provides a powerful tool to analyze various optical phenomena in dielectric spheres.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} NEXT {{experiment}} is the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay in $^{ 136 }$Xe using a gaseous xenon TPC with electroluminescent amplification and specialized photodetector arrays for calorimetry and tracking. The NEXT Collaboration is exploring a number of reconstruction algorithms to exploit the full potential of the detector. This paper describes one of them: the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) method, a generic iterative algorithm to find maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters that {{has been applied to}} solve many different types of complex inverse problems. In particular, we discuss a bi-dimensional version of the method in which the photosensor signals integrated over time are used to reconstruct a <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> of the event. First results show that, when applied to detector simulation data, the algorithm achieves nearly optimal energy resolution (better than 0. 5 % FWHM at the Q value of $^{ 136 }$Xe) for events distributed over the full active volume of the TPC.

50|$|Largocephalosaurus is a basal saurosphargid, less {{modified}} morphologically {{from the}} archetypal diapsid reptile compared to advanced saurosphargids like Sinosaurosphargis. However, {{even in its}} original description that interpreted it as an eosauropterygian sauropterygian, several traits later identified as saurosphargid were noted. These include back vertebrae that show elongated, distally expanded <b>transverse</b> <b>projections,</b> and its broadened and flattened chest ribs. Yet, Largocephalosaurus unlike other saurosphargids retains an elongate body shape, a well-developed supratemporal fenestra, an oval suborbital fenestra (although much reduced compared to non-saurosphargids) and an incomplete dorsal osteoderm carapace. Additionally, the advanced saurosphargids Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis have broader and flatter rib baskets, and also <b>transverse</b> <b>projections</b> of back vertebrae and proximal portions of chest ribs that are much more robust than in Largocephalosaurus, being much wider than the spacing between them. Other differences include: the presence {{of three or four}} teeth on the premaxilla, and its exclusion from the external nostril outline; an elongated frontal bone back-side facing projection; the presence of a row of large osteoderms {{on the top of the}} neural spines, in the midline of the partial osteoderm shield; and similarly rounded coracoid and pubis bone with the coracoid foramen and the obturator fenestra present and open (respectively).|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} overview and final summary {{of all four}} types of static track distortions seen in the HARP TPC, in terms of physical origins, mathematical modelling, and correction algorithms. 'Static'Ã‚Â™ distortions are defined as not depending on the event time within the 400 ms long accelerator spill. Calculated static distortions are compared with measurements from cosmic-muon tracks. We characterize track distortions by the r phi residuals of cluster positions {{with respect to the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>projection</b> of a helical trajectory constrained by hits in the RPC overlap regions. This method provides a fixed TPC-external reference system (by contrast to the co-moving coordinate system associated with a fit) which solely permits to identify individually, and measure quantitatively, the static TPC track distortions arising from (i) the inhomogeneity of the solenoidal magnetic field, (ii) the inhomogeneity of the electric field from the high-voltage mismatch between the inner and outer TPC field cages, (iii) the anode-wire durchgriff, and (iv) a homogenous ion-charge density in the drift volume. Five voltage levels are identified which were set incorrectly during data taking with the HARP TPC, and unfortunately conspired toward large static and dynamic track distortions. The observed time development of static distortions after a 83 mKr calibration lends decisive support to our conclusions on static TPC distortions...|$|E

We addressed synchronization problem of an array of the linearly coupled map lattices of identical discrete time systems. The synchronization rate is determined by the second largest eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix. Algebraic properties of the Bose-Mesner algebra with an associated scheme with definite spectrum has been used in order to study the stability of the coupled map lattice. Associated schemes play a key role and may lead to analytical methods in studying the stability of the dynamical systems. The relation between the coupling parameters and the chaotic region is presented. It is shown that the feasible region is analytically determined by the number of couplings (i. e, by increasing the number of coupled maps the feasible region is restricted). It is very easy to apply our criteria to the system being studied and they encompass a wide range of coupling schemes including most of the popularly used ones in the literature.
