25|$|A common {{feature of}} many Australian {{languages}} {{is that they}} display so-called avoidance speech, special speech registers used only {{in the presence of}} certain close relatives. These registers share the phonology and grammar of the standard language, but the lexicon is different and usually very restricted. There are also commonly speech taboos during extended periods of mourning or initiation <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> numerous Aboriginal sign languages.|$|E

25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated.

25|$|Reductions in {{populations of}} C. mydas are {{recorded}} in every ocean ecosystem they inhabit, and the contributing factors <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> their decline are all anthropogenic.

The most common accidental threat is the entanglement in fishing equipment with the most harmful methods being drift netting, shrimp trawling, long-lining, and dynamite fishing. Many pieces of legislation now ban these practices in protected areas.|$|E

Because of political instability in the Middle East and increasing domestic demand for energy, India is keen on decreasing its dependency on OPEC to meet its oil demand, and increasing its energy security. Several Indian oil companies, primarily led by ONGC and Reliance Industries, have started a massive hunt for oil in several regions in India, including Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari Basin and north-eastern Himalayas. India is developing an offshore gas field in Mozambique. The proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline {{is a part of}} India's plan to meet its increasing energy demand.|$|E

25|$|A {{large-scale}} Capitol dome restoration project, {{the first}} extensive such work since 1959–1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration. As of 2012, $20 million in {{work around the}} skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair {{the exterior of the}} dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations, but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014. Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome. All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E

25|$|Boron {{has found}} many {{industrial}} applications in recent decades, and new ones {{are still being}} found. A common application is in fiberglass. There has been rapid expansion {{in the market for}} borosilicate glass; most notable among its special qualities is a much greater resistance to thermal expansion than regular glass. Another commercially expanding use of boron and its derivatives is in ceramics. Several boron compounds, especially the oxides, have unique and valuable properties <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> their substitution for other materials that are less useful. Boron may be found in pots, vases, plates, and ceramic pan-handles for its insulating properties. The compound borax is used in bleaches, for both clothes and teeth. The hardness of boron and some of its compounds give it a wide array of additional uses. A small part (5%) of the boron produced finds use in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|According to the APSAC Task Force, {{there are}} controversies within the {{attachment}} therapy community about coercive practices.

A number of therapies are quite different from those <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the abuse and deaths of children in much publicized court cases. The Task Force, however, points out that all the therapies, including those using frankly coercive practices, present themselves as humane, respectful and nurturing, therefore caution is advised. Some practitioners condemn the most dangerous techniques but continue to practice other coercive techniques. Others have taken a public stand against coercion. The Task Force was of the view that all could benefit from more transparency and specificity {{as to how the}} therapy is behaviorally delivered.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles, grouped {{with all}} populations of Chelonia mydas, are {{listed on the}} IUCN Red List of {{threatened}} species. They {{were placed on the}} list in the mid 1980s and have remained under protection since. One of the major problems <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> their decline is the slow growth rate and long period from juvenile to sexual maturity. Chelonians average a period of 26–40 years to maturity; the Galápagos green turtle averages 33years. The green sea turtle has been shown to have the slowest growth rate of any species of sea turtle and is generally long-lived if left undisturbed. Overall, populations of C. mydas have had a decrease of about 48–67% of nesting females, but the population that nests in the Galápagos has remained quite steady with little to no change. The population of nesting females recorded in the Galápagos from 1976–1982 was roughly 1400individuals and after further evaluation in 1999–2001, around 1400nesting females were found.|$|E
