Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British pattern of large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed.

5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>process</b> {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, {{contrast and}} overall disruptive effect.

The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a generic coding scheme utilized in a protocol analysis to study professional software designers.

40|$|Complex {{mechanical}} products are a priority area of advanced manufacturing {{strategy in the}} USA and Europe. Excellent models for <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex {{mechanical products}} are essential for managers or designers to manage <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> and further improve design efficiency. Multiple elements and complicated relationships between elements in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products cause difficulties in systematically and quantitatively expressing <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>processes.</b> Therefore, we put forth a supernetwork-based model for designing complex mechanical products. First, we identified the key elements in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products. Next, based on this we analyzed sub-elements of the key elements and relationships between sub-elements. Then we built sub-networks with sub-elements as nodes and their relationships as edges and the supernetwork model for <b>design</b> <b>processes</b> of complex mechanical products based on the sub-networks and their relationships. Meanwhile, we also present a method for combining linguistic variables with the corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers, and a max/min synthesis method to accurately compute the edge weights. Finally, we suggest the practical applications of the proposed model and give {{a comparison of the}} proposed model and existing ones to verify the feasibility and validity of this study...|$|R

5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy {{to design a}} ship that could serve in both colonial and fleet scout roles.

This was a relatively novel development; at the time of Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine.

Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>process</b> to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.|$|E

5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>process</b> extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>process,</b> particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This is incorrect, as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E
