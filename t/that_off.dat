5|$|On January 7, 2016, Sony Music and The Estate of Michael Jackson {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Off</b> the Wall {{would be}} reissued and packaged {{with a new}} documentary directed by Spike Lee entitled Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall. The reissue and documentary were both released on February 26, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's previous work for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. Several critics observed <b>that</b> <b>Off</b> the Wall was crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull <b>that</b> <b>off.</b> Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

25|$|One nagging {{fear was}} the {{possible}} {{collapse of the}} Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head <b>that</b> <b>off</b> Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the Bosphorus Strait, {{as well as from}} threatening India via Afghanistan. In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the Crimean War against Russia. Despite mediocre generalship, they managed to capture the Russian port of Sevastopol, compelling Tsar Nicholas I to ask for peace.|$|E

It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend <b>that</b> <b>off</b> all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|Once a naval {{battle was}} underway, {{for the men}} involved, there were {{numerous}} ways for them to meet their end. Drowning {{was perhaps the most}} common way for a crew member to perish. Once a trireme had been rammed, the ensuing panic that engulfed the men trapped below deck no doubt extended the amount of time it took the men to escape. Inclement weather would greatly decrease the crew's odds of survival, leading to a situation like <b>that</b> <b>off</b> Cape Athos in 411 (12 of 10,000 men were saved). An estimated 40,000 Persians died in the Battle of Salamis.

Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E

Nelson George stated that the argument for Jackson's greatness began with the arrangements of [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". He noted that the percussion and backing vocals were [...] "artfully choreographed" [...] to [...] "create drama and ecstasy on the dance floor". He concluded, [...] "It's one thing to make a dance record [...] it is another to instill that track with an epic, celebratory quality as Michael does here". James Montgomery of MTV noted <b>that</b> <b>Off</b> The Wall contained a [...] "masterful mixture of fiery disco tracks", specifying [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] and [...] "Workin' Day and Night".|$|E

Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, [...] "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain". Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot [...] "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me". When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being pumped. Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled <b>that</b> <b>off</b> set there was an [...] "innocence about him" [...] that was not seen.|$|E

The final song was streamed live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi {{has said that he}} does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, [...] "I wouldn't write <b>that</b> <b>off,</b> if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know if that would happen."

500|$|For this record, Björk {{incorporated}} shelved songs {{she wrote}} in Manchester with 808 State's Graham Massey, which had preceded the recording sessions for Debut. These included [...] "Army of Me" [...] and [...] "The Modern Things", which had become live staples over the summer, and thus {{did not need to}} undergo extensive transformations at Compass Point. Massey stated: [...] "With [...] "Army of Me" [...] we wanted to try something that was quite hard and techno-y. I'm not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast but I remember that song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked <b>that</b> <b>off</b> in one day and then started on [...] "The Modern Things" [...] the same day and finished that the next". Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Björk felt it was not yet complete and decided to continue its production back in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months [...] "tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks". Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more [...] "real" [...] instruments that [...] "resuscitated Post for Björk".|$|E

500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull <b>that</b> <b>off,</b> I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E
500|$|Music critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Stephen Holden of AllMusic {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>Off</b> the Wall was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soul, soft rock, {{jazz and}} pop ballads. Prominent {{examples include the}} ballad [...] "She's Out of My Life", the funk tune [...] "Workin' Day and Night", and the disco song [...] "Get on the Floor". [...] "I Can't Help It" [...] is a jazz piece. In Quincy Jones' autobiography, he compares Jackson to other jazz singers noting that Jackson [...] "has {{some of the same}} qualities as the great jazz singers I'd worked with: Ella, Sinatra, Sassy, Aretha, Ray Charles, Dinah. Each of them had that purity, that strong signature sound and that open wound that pushed them to greatness." [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] is a melodic pop ballad. The end of the former song showed an [...] "emotional" [...] Jackson crying as the track concluded. Of the song, rhythm and blues writer Nelson George proclaimed, [...] " [...] became a Jackson signature similar to the way [...] "My Way" [...] served Frank Sinatra. The vulnerability, verging on fragility that would become embedded in Michael's persona found, perhaps, its richest expression in this wistful ballad". [...] "Rock with You" [...] is a romantic, mid-tempo song. The album's songs have a tempo ranging from 66 beats per minute on [...] "She's Out of My Life", to 128 on [...] "Workin' Day and Night".|$|E
500|$|Michael Schur {{said another}} {{goal of the}} third season was to better {{demonstrate}} the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones, whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters. This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger, who is so overly-optimistic and seemingly-perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him. Schur said: [...] "Rashida is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like <b>that</b> <b>off</b> balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe {{in a relationship with}} you." [...] Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] that Chris broke up with her, but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days. Afterward, Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men. During the final episodes of the season, Ann takes a part-time job at city hall as the health department public relations director, which Schur described as [...] "the natural full circle {{from the beginning of the}} season". This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a [...] "more mature person". Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters.|$|E

500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a pretty hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor to pull <b>that</b> <b>off</b> and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed <b>that</b> <b>off</b> and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to happen is Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s actually like the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like <b>that</b> <b>off</b> balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E
