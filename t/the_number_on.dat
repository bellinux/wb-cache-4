5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> {{the top and bottom}} of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E

Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E

For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E
25|$|England bowled {{consistently}} {{well in the}} Test {{series against}} South Africa, with Stuart Broad taking 4-25 and Steven Finn 4-42 as England won the first Test. A less impressive performance followed in the next game as the batsman came out on top. In the third Test, Stuart Broad took figures of 6-17 as South Africa were bowled out for just 83 and England {{went on to win}} the series 2-1. Following the series, Stuart Broad was ranked as <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> Test bowler in the world. In the ODI series, Reece Topley performed well, taking figures of 4-50 in the second ODI and 3-41 in the final match of the series, although South Africa won the series 3-2. In the second T20I, England's bowlers struggled as South Africa played aggressively and the quick bowlers proved ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Before the game, Ball State players wore red T-shirts with Love’s jersey number 86on {{the front}} during warmups, and had {{stickers}} with <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> {{the back of}} their helmets. A “We Love Dante” sign was draped over the fence just past the north end zone and Love also was named an honorary captain. MiQuale Lewis opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Nate Davis threw a pass to Myles Trempe for a 31-yard touchdown that gave the Cardinals a 14–0 lead. Kent State responded late in the quarter when quarterback Julian Edelman scored on a 12-yard run to cut Ball State’s lead to 14–7. Lewis scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run with 21seconds left in the second quarter to give the Cardinals a 21–7 lead at halftime. Cory Sykes’ 10yard touchdown run in the opening minutes of the third quarter made it 28–7, and the Cardinals led by at least 17points the rest of the way. Lewis ran for 116yards and three touchdowns and Davis passed for 265yards and a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a maximum}} of 15 players from each team on a rugby field at one time. The players {{position}} {{at the start of}} the game is indicated by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the back of their shirts, 1 to 15. The positions are divided into two main categories; forwards (numbered 1 to 8) and backs (numbered 9 to 15). In international matches, there are eight substitutes that can replace an on-field team member. The substitutes, numbered 16 to 23, can either take up the position of the player they replace or the on-field players can be shuffled to make room for this player in another position. Typically, the replacement players will have a number that corresponds with their intended replacement position with the numbers from 16 to 20 being forwards and 21 to 23 being backs (depending on the composition of the reserves). There are no personal squad numbers and a versatile player's position and number may change from one game to the next. Players can also change positions with players on the field during the match, and, as long as the laws are followed, any player can change positions with another player during the match. Common examples are the fly-half playing the full-back's position in defence or a prop taking the hooker's position at line-outs.|$|E
25|$|Del Rio finally {{received}} his title shot on June 16 at Payback, {{and during the}} match, a double-turn occurred; Del Rio turned heel once again by repeatedly and ruthlessly targeting Ziggler's head after his recent concussion to defeat Ziggler and regain the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio later explained that he targeted Ziggler's head the same way Ziggler targeted Del Rio's injured leg when Ziggler cashed in Money in the Bank to win the title from Del Rio. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Del Rio defeated Ziggler by disqualification to retain the World Heavyweight Title, after Ziggler's girlfriend AJ Lee hit Del Rio {{in the face with}} her Divas Championship belt. The next night on Raw, Del Rio defeated Ziggler in a non-title rematch after a distraction by AJ. On the July 29 episode of Raw, Del Rio re-entered a feud with Christian after losing to him in a non-title match. On the August 2 episode of SmackDown, after Christian won a triple-threat match to become <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, Del Rio attacked him during a post-match interview. On the August 5 episode of Raw, Del Rio lost a non-title match to Rob Van Dam, after Ricardo Rodriguez's interference backfired, which led to Del Rio viciously attacking Rodriguez post-match. On the August 9 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio again lost to Christian in a non-title match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Del Rio successfully defended the World Heavyweight Title against Christian. Upon Rodriguez's return, he aligned himself with Rob Van Dam, accompanying him to matches and helping him defeat Del Rio in a non-title match to earn a shot at the World Heavyweight Title. On the September 13 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Rodriguez in a single match. On September 15 Night of Champions, Van Dam defeated Del Rio by disqualification after Del Rio refused to relinquish the cross armbreaker, retaining the World Heavyweight Championship in result. After the match, Van Dam attacked Del Rio and executed the Van Terminator. On October 6 at Battleground, Del Rio defeated Van Dam in a Hardcore match by submission to again retain his title. The next night on Raw, Del Rio lost to Ricardo Rodriguez after Vickie Guerrero announced his Hell in a Cell opponent as John Cena. Afterwards, Del Rio brutally attacked Rodriguez. On October 27 at Hell in a Cell, Del Rio lost the World Heavyweight Title to Cena, ending his reign at 133 days. Del Rio {{received his}} rematch for the title on November 24 at Survivor Series, but again lost to Cena.|$|E

500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E
