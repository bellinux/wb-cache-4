5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E

Therefore, to develop these <b>three</b> <b>fingered,</b> a solid model is prepared in Solid works. Kinematic analysis is carried out to find position, orientation and joint values of the gripper by forward and inverse kinematic equation. Grasping mechanism is also discussed in the thesis for gripping an object precisely...|$|R
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the <b>three</b> <b>fingers,</b> the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Sheriff Carver {{looks for}} Nate, and Deputy Lane sets out {{look for the}} missing group of rafters. Sheriff Carver finds the group but is killed by <b>Three</b> <b>Finger.</b> Chavez and Floyd get into a fist fight while Brandon watches, {{allowing}} Nate and Alex to escape. After the fight, Chavez and Brandon leave the knocked out Floyd behind. When they hear Alex and Nate talking, they lay the money down before taking them hostage again. They find the location where the watch tower once stood, only to discover it was burned down years ago. Floyd finds the money and attempts to run away with it, but he stumbles on some rocks and cries out. Chavez hears him and finds Floyd, only to see <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> lobbing a molotov cocktail at Floyd, killing him and burning all the money. Chavez gives Alex to <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> to improve his chances of survival. <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> drags Alex into his truck and drives off.

5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{hands and}} forearms of Triceratops {{retained}} a fairly primitive structure {{compared to other}} quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward ("pronated") as the animals walked. Triceratops, like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods, walked with most of their fingers pointing out {{and away from the}} body, the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods. In Triceratops, the weight of the body was carried by only the first <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> of the hand, while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food.

40|$|Moore's Law {{has given}} the {{application}} designer a large palette of potential computational substrates. The application designer can potential map his or her application onto specialized task-specific accelerators for either energy or performance benefits; however, the design space for task-specific accelerators is large. At one extreme is the conventional microprocessor, easy to program but relatively low-performance and energy inefficient. At the other extreme is custom, fixed-function hardware crafted solely for a given task. Studies have reported energy-efficiency gains using fixed-function hardware from 2 × to 100 × over programmable solutions. If we wish to evaluate this design space we need prototypes for the elements of it; however, constructing functional prototypes for each hardware substrate is a daunting prospect. This is because each implementation target requires a radically different set of programming and design tools. To address the challenges of mapping applications across {{a broad range of}} targets, this thesis presents <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack. <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack is a highly productive approachto generating applications that run on multicore CPUs or data-parallel processors. <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack also integrates a high-level hardware synthesis engine that has the ability to generate custom hardware implementations. <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack applies dependence analysis and reordering transformations to a restricted set of Python loop nests to uncover parallelism. By exploiting data parallelism, <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack allows the programmer to use the same Python source to target all three supported platforms. It exploits this parallelism on CPUs and vector-thread processors by generating multithreaded code with short-vector instructions. The high-level hardware synthesis engine uses the parallelism found by the system to both exploit memory-level parallelism and automatically generate multiple parallel processing engines. On a 3. 4 GHz Intel i 7 - 2600 CPU, <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jack generated software solutions that obtained performance between 0. 97 - 113. 3 × of hand-written C++ across four kernels and two applications. Over four kernels, <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jacks high-level synthesis results are between 1. 5 - 12. 1 × faster than an optimized soft-core CPU on a Zynq XC 7 Z 020 FPGA. When evaluated in a 45 nm ASIC technology, the results of <b>Three</b> <b>Fingered</b> Jacks high-levelsynthesis system is 3. 6 × more efficient than an optimized scalar processor on the key kernels used in automatic speech recognition. On the same speech recognition kernels, the hardware results are 2. 4 × more energy efficient than a highly optimized data-parallel processor...|$|R
