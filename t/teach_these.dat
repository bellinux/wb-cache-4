5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. They asked for a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to <b>teach</b> <b>these</b> seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E

25|$|Weinzweig’s {{move toward}} {{serialism}} {{was not a}} complete transition; he was very selective and deliberate in which principles he chose to adopt. While he acknowledged that Schoenberg’s influence on the musical world was powerful, he was not particularly taken with Schoeberg’s music and preferred that of composers such as Berg and Webern. His attraction to serialism {{was not the same}} as that of its Viennese founders. Since he was not taught strictly using tonality in his early education, he did not feel the need to rebel and use serialism simply as a means to avoid tonality. While he often employed the techniques used by Stravinsky, Bartók, Copland and Varèse, he did not <b>teach</b> <b>these</b> methods to his students exclusively.|$|E

500|$|Entire {{chapters}} of Aradia {{are devoted to}} rituals and magic spells. These include enchantments to win love (Chapter VI), a conjuration to perform when finding a stone with a hole or a round stone in order {{to turn it into}} an amulet for Diana's favour (Chapter IV), and the consecration of a ritual feast for Diana, Aradia, and Cain (Chapter II). [...] The narrative material makes up less of the text, and is composed of short stories and legends about the birth of the witchcraft religion and the actions of their gods. Leland summarises the mythic material in the book in its appendix, writing [...] "Diana is Queen of the Witches; an associate of Herodias (Aradia) in her relations to sorcery; that she bore a child to her brother the Sun (here Lucifer); that as a moon-goddess she is in some relation to Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and that the witches of old were people oppressed by feudal lands, the former revenging themselves in every way, and holding orgies to Diana which the Church represented as being the worship of Satan". Diana is not only the witches' goddess, but is presented as the primordial creatrix in Chapter III, dividing herself into darkness and light. After giving birth to Lucifer, Diana seduces him while {{in the form of a}} cat, eventually giving birth to Aradia, their daughter. Diana demonstrates the power of her witchcraft by creating [...] "the heavens, the stars and the rain", becoming [...] "Queen of the Witches". Chapter I presents the original witches as slaves that escaped from their masters, beginning new lives as [...] "thieves and evil folk". Diana sends her daughter Aradia to them to <b>teach</b> <b>these</b> former serfs witchcraft, the power of which they can use to [...] "destroy the evil race (of oppressors)". [...] Aradia's students thus became the first witches, who would then continue the worship of Diana. [...] Leland was struck by this cosmogony: [...] "In all other Scriptures of all races, it is the male ... who creates the universe; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle".|$|E

Franklin's writings on virtue were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work Portrait of American Culture. Max Weber considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the Protestant ethic, which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of capitalism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{origin of}} Japanese martial arts {{can be found}} in the warrior traditions of the samurai and the caste system that restricted the use of weapons by members of the non-warrior classes. Originally, samurai were expected to be proficient in many weapons, as well as unarmed combat, and attain the highest possible mastery of combat skills, for the purpose of glorifying either themselves or their liege.

2500|$|However, the {{banning of}} the kirpan was not {{proportionate}} to the objective. [...] It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations. [...] The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school. [...] The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely. [...] The thief would have to seize the claimant and look under the claimant's clothing. [...] Additionally, {{there was little to}} no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools. [...] Although cases involving airline security have resulted in {{the banning of}} kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different people who never know each other. [...] There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent. [...] As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. [...] Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. [...] The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. [...] The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism. [...] If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should <b>teach</b> <b>these</b> students the importance of freedom of religion.|$|E
