[...] The material which is used in Forged Composite technology is an evolution of carbon fiber sheet molding compounds (CFSMC) with improved fibers, higher fiber volume content, and an improved molding process; all of which increase the average strength values and reduce variability over standard carbon fiber SMC. [...] The material is one-third as dense as metal titanium but stronger, and consists of chopped carbon fiber tows that are sandwiched between two layers of filmed resin. [...] It uses about 500,000 intertwined <b>turbostratic</b> fibers per square inch. [...] The structure of the high strength carbon fibers is described as <b>turbostratic,</b> that is the fibers contain intertwined and folded sheets of carbon atoms aligned with {{the length of the}} fiber, and the intertwining improved the fiber strength. The result, which is superior to predecessor alloys used in the automotive and golf industries, is significantly improved load carrying capacity as measured in bending per unit of mass. [...] Due to its chopped nature, it can be molded into much more complex geometries than traditional carbon fiber composites, and is suitable to make three-dimensional parts and parts which feature complex details such as thickness transitions, holes, compound curvature, etc. Chopped carbon fiber materials produced by Quantum Composites Inc. of Bay City, MI, as well as Mitsubishi Rayon of Toyohashi, Japan, can be used for Forged Composite technology.|$|E

Our high-throughput Zn reduction method (C/Fe = 1 : 5, 500 °C, 3 h) produced the AMS target of graphite-coated iron powder (GCIP), a mix of nongraphitic carbon and Fe 3 C. Crystallinity of the AMS targets of GCIP (nongraphitic carbon) was increased to <b>turbostratic</b> carbon by raising the C/Fe ratio from 1 : 5 to 1 : 1 and the graphitization temperature from 500 to 585 °C. The AMS target of GCIP containing <b>turbostratic</b> carbon had a large isotopic fractionation and a low AMS ion current. The AMS target of GCIP containing <b>turbostratic</b> carbon also yielded less accurate/precise 14 C-AMS measurements because of the lower graphitization yield and lower thermal conductivity that were caused by the higher C/Fe ratio of 1 : 1. On the other hand, the AMS target of GCIP containing nongraphitic carbon had higher graphitization yield and better thermal conductivity over the AMS target of GCIP containing <b>turbostratic</b> carbon due to optimal surface area provided by the iron powder. Finally, graphitization yield and thermal conductivity were stronger determinants (over graphite crystallinity) for accurate/precise/high-throughput biological, biomedical, and environmental 14 C-AMS applications such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME), and physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) of nutrients, drugs, phytochemicals, and environmental chemicals...|$|E

Sample EX M 1694, a clay with red-beige appearance from the Madrid basin was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray fluorescence analysis, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, simultaneous thermal analysis, gas adsorption measurements, cation exchange capacity, and environmental scanning electron microscopy. More than 95 % of particles in EX M 1964 belong to the clay fraction < 2 µm.

The EB process is found to depend on both the graphene type and on the ambient conditions. For the mechanically exfoliated graphene, performing EB under vacuum leads to a higher yield of nanometer-gap formation than working in air.

For this material, real and imaginary part of relative permittivity is measured in a frequency range of 1 – 18 GHz at room temperature. The results reveal that the permittivity and dielectric loss in the SiC nanofibres are a magnitude higher compared with sub-microcrystalline SiC powder. Composition and nanostructure are held responsible for the difference in dielectric properties. The mechanisms of dielectric loss in the SiC nanofibres are discussed based on interfacial polarization, lattice defects in the SiC nanofibre cores and conduction loss of <b>turbostratic</b> carbon in the thorn-like sheath of SiC nanofibres...|$|E

On the C-face of SiC substrates we have shown that long, self-ordered, graphene ribbons can be grown. These ribbons have excellent crystalline quality and are strain relaxed.

Therefore, oxycarbide glasses exhibit the so-called "anomalous" hardness behavior, similar to silica-rich glasses, with a substantial densification-strain component beneath the indenter. However, the role of carbon is twofold: on the one hand, the covalently bonded carbon atoms slightly affect the behavior, similar to the way network modifiers affect the behavior of silicate glasses, and favor a "normal" indentation behavior; and on the other hand, the free carbon, forming <b>turbostratic</b> graphite domains, provides easy crack initiation sites and low-energy fracture paths.

Typically, whether the structure is either <b>turbostratic</b> or graphitic makes the flake morphotype be either crumpled or folded, as a consequenceof preferred folding directions related to lattice periodicities. In this regard, structure prevails over nanotexture.
