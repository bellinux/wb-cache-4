5|$|Although the bat's {{status in}} Myanmar {{is not well}} known, the Thai {{population}} is restricted to a single province and {{may be at risk}} for extinction. Its potential <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> primarily anthropogenic, and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, 97 {{freshwater}} fish species from the Western Ghats were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered and 31 vulnerable. All but one (Tor khudree) {{of these are}} endemic to the Western Ghats. An additional 26 species from the region are considered data deficient (their status is unclear at present). The primary <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation and introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's reefs {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E
50|$|On March 23, 2015, a bomb <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> sent {{to several}} {{teachers}} {{early in the}} morning resulting in the closure of the school. The <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> ruled a hoax after police swept the building and found nothing.|$|R
50|$|However, this useful {{reaction}} to a physical <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> also triggered under perceived <b>threats</b> that <b>are</b> not physical in nature.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> a communicated {{intent to}} inflict harm or loss on another person. [...] A <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{an act of}} coercion. <b>Threats</b> (intimidation) <b>are</b> widely observed in animal behavior, particularly in a ritualized form, chiefly {{in order to avoid}} the unnecessary physical violence that can lead to physical damage or the death of both conflicting parties.|$|R
5|$|In {{both the}} Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance, becomes deeply lovesick {{at the sight}} of her shimmering beauty, and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr (where Gerðr and her father Gymir reside) to gain her love. In the Poetic Edda Gerðr {{initially}} refuses, yet after a series of threats by Skírnir she finally agrees. In the Prose Edda, no mention of <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> made. In both sources, Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time at the location of Barri and, after Skírnir returns with Gerðr's response, Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the jötunn Aurboða.|$|E
5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input {{on how to deal}} with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow has a {{restricted}} distribution, primarily occurring within the Indus valley of Pakistan, {{and the lower}} parts of the tributaries of the Indus in the Punjab region. Its distribution extends from the Indus Delta north to the Kabul River near Nowshera and the Jhelum near Nurpur Noon, extending east into India {{as far as the}} Delhi area. It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of Balochistan, and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran. The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range, and no <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> known to the survival of the species, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5000|$|In one {{reaction}} to the Bill, <b>threats</b> <b>were</b> made against Bradford on the [...] "CYFS Watch" [...] website. After the Ministry of Social Development complained about the threats, Google shut down the website. Further death <b>threats</b> <b>were</b> made against her in August 2009.|$|R
50|$|On April 4, 2014, Hutchinson Central Technical High School {{went into}} {{lockdown}} after a bomb <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> posted on Facebook. However, no explosive device {{was found in}} the school and after two hours, the lockdown was lifted. The 15-year-old sophomore student that police say posted the <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> arrested.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> {{potential}} <b>threats</b> {{to program}} sustainability. The most common <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> funding. Coordinators who take {{lead of the}} program worry {{that if they are}} to leave the school no one would replace them and the program <b>was</b> cease. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> the potential stigma for students participating in the program. This speaks to the idea of school breakfast programs being available to all students. Programs that are mainly directed at at-risk students report stigma. Another <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> catering to students’ food allergies and religious and cultural dietary restrictions.|$|R
5|$|During his investigations, {{the protagonist}} and Rei learn of {{multiple}} demon-run criminal organizations causing chaos in Hirasaki including factions of the Yakuza, {{all of them}} connected to Davis. The protagonist's efforts against the demon <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> hindered by Hideo Momochi, who accuses the pair {{of being involved in}} the incidents until the police station is infested by demons and the police chief is revealed to be a demon in disguise. The protagonist also foils an attempt to Kumiko for unknown reasons. After taking down each of the five major demon factions, Davis reveals that the entire affair was orchestrated to break five seals holding prisoner the spirit of Inaruna: once a powerful regional priestess who was executed for resisting the forces of Emperor Jimmu with her magical powers during the unification of Japan, her spirit's hatred for her conquerors has grown beyond control and she will destroy the city if released. Kumiko, the reincarnation of Inaruna, is successfully abducted by Davis and used as a host for Inaruna's spirit. Although she is summoned, the protagonist and Rei rescue Kumiko and kill Davis. They then successfully defeat Inaruna. With the city returned to normal, the protagonist remains trapped in Kuzunoha's body, and can choose either to use his own name or adopt the Kuzunoha title.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{financial}} stability involves protecting against {{threats to the}} whole financial system. <b>Threats</b> <b>are</b> detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions. The <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> then dealt with through financial and other operations, {{both at home and}} abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the lender of last resort by extending credit when no other institution will.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> sprawl of the Guaratuba and Matinhos urban areas, predatory {{fishing and}} buffalo farming.|$|E
40|$|<b>Threats</b> against psychiatrists <b>are</b> common, but {{existing}} {{studies on}} the subject lack descriptive information {{about the nature and}} resolution of the threat. In the present study, clinicians who had received <b>threats</b> <b>were</b> interviewed in person or by telephone, and case histories <b>were</b> summarized. <b>Threats</b> <b>were</b> classified as situational and transferential. Demographic factors, precipitating events, and legal actions taken are described. The manner in which clinicians reacted to <b>threats</b> <b>is</b> also discussed. "No physician, however conscientious or careful. can tell what day or hour he may not be made the object of some unde-served attack, malicious accusation, blackmail, or suit for damages [...] " I Since this observation was published in 1892, threats against clinicians remain ubiquitous. Yet the nature of the <b>threats</b> <b>is</b> the subject of limited research and of only Dr. Brown, formerly a resident at Albert Einstein Med-ical Cenlcr, Philadelphia, PA and a forcnsic fellow i...|$|R

5000|$|A non-credible <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> made on {{the hope}} that it will be believed, and {{therefore}} the threatening undesirable action will not need to be carried out. For a <b>threat</b> to <b>be</b> credible within an equilibrium, whenever a [...] node is reached where a <b>threat</b> should <b>be</b> fulfilled, it will be fulfilled. Those Nash equilibria that rely on non-credible <b>threats</b> can <b>be</b> eliminated through backward induction; the remaining equilibria are called subgame perfect Nash equilibria.|$|R

25|$|Environmental <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> {{the concern}} of many {{non-profit}} environmental stewardship groups, especially The Friends of the Smokies. Formed in 1993, the friends group assists the National Park Service in its mission to preserve and protect the Great Smoky Mountains National Park by raising funds and public awareness, and providing volunteers for needed projects.|$|E
25|$|Legally {{employed}} domestic {{workers are}} distinct from illegally employed domestic servants. While legally employed domestic house workers are fairly compensated {{for their work}} in accordance with national wage laws, domestic servants are typically forced to work extremely long hours for little to no monetary compensation, and psychological and physical means are employed to limit their mobility and freedom. In addition, deportation <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> often used to discourage internationally trafficked persons from seeking help.|$|E
25|$|An armed {{version for}} the {{close air support}} role will have a maximum weapons load of 3,300lb (1,500kg) and also carry a forward-looking {{infrared}} (FLIR) sensor. It will be capable of operating from unprepared runways. The Turkish Army has expressed interests in using the aircraft in counter insurgency environments and {{it is hoped that}} it will attract export orders. The main advantage will be to lower the cost of air power, especially in low-intensity combat theatres where anti-air warfare <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> minimal.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>threat</b> may <b>be</b> either {{empirical}} (an outside observer may {{agree that}} the event or circumstance poses a threat) or a priori (an outside observer would not {{agree that the}} event or circumstance poses a <b>threat).</b> What <b>is</b> important to the individual, {{in terms of the}} body’s response, <b>is</b> that a <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> perceived.|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of anthropogenic <b>threats</b> <b>is</b> key to sustaining biological diversity in protected areas. Types {{and distribution of}} threats to Bwindi ImpenetrableNationalPark,Ugandawere investigated to assess thePark’s status 12 {{years after it was}} upgraded from a forest reserve to a national park. Bwindi, like many tropical forested parks, is surrounded by dense human populations. <b>Threats</b> <b>were</b> quantified in 104 1 -km edge-interior transects set around the Park. The distribution of <b>threats</b> <b>was</b> patchy and was most common within 300 – 350 m of the edge. The commonest <b>threat</b> <b>was</b> harvesting of wood and poles. Other threats included occurrence of exotic species, degradation of adjacent habitat fragments and high impact of problem animals on some of the neighbouring communities. The fact that <b>threats</b> <b>were</b> primarily associated with the edges of the Park, when previously they were widespread throughout the Park, suggests that illegal resource harvesting has been reduced since the forest was upgraded to a national park. Park legislation, enforcement and related conservation efforts have been effective, and there should be increased effort to manage the people-park interface. Edge-based assessments appear to be useful for quantifying threats to protected areas and identifying areas in which they are concentrated...|$|R
50|$|Classified as Near-Threatened by the IUCN, {{its main}} <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> habitat loss.|$|R
25|$|Major <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> habitat {{fragmentation}} and destruction. Although they are hunted throughout their range, it generally {{has little or}} only localized impact on the populations of the more widespread and common species. Pesticides are a problem throughout the grasslands and farmlands. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies seven tinamou species as vulnerable and seven as near threatened. The solitary tinamou is listed under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).|$|E
25|$|Reductions in {{populations of}} C. mydas are {{recorded}} in every ocean ecosystem they inhabit, and the contributing {{factors that have}} led to their decline are all anthropogenic. The main <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> harvesting of eggs and individuals, bycatch in marine fisheries, and degradation of the marine and coastal habitats. The most common accidental threat is the entanglement in fishing equipment with the most harmful methods being drift netting, shrimp trawling, long-lining, and dynamite fishing. Many pieces of legislation now ban these practices in protected areas.|$|E
25|$|The area {{features}} three rare fish species: the venomous stonecat (Noturus flavus), {{the only}} catfish species in Alberta, St. Mary's Sculpin (Cottus bairdi punctulatus), {{and the western}} silvery minnow (Hybognathus argyritis). All three are under threatened status in Alberta, and the western silvery minnow was upgraded to endangered in Canada by COSEWIC in April 2008. Their greatest <b>threats</b> <b>are</b> habitat alteration or loss, changes in water flow or drought water levels, increased siltation, elevated water temperatures, surface water extraction, dam construction, and for the western silvery minnow, introduction of predatory fish species.|$|E
