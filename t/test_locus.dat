However, the usual statistical analysis applied to such experiments {{may lead to}} erroneous conclusions about linkage unless unusually stringent criteria are adopted for rejecting the null hypothesis. We describe a Bayesian statistical approach for determining the probability of linkage when no prior information is available about {{the location of the}} gene to be mapped (the <b>test</b> <b>locus).</b> We present a table that gives the probability of linkage, the most likely position of the <b>test</b> <b>locus</b> with respect to a marker locus, and the interval around the marker locus that has a 95 % chance of containing the <b>test</b> <b>locus,</b> for all possible experimental results suggesting linkage in sets of up to 40 RI strains. These results show that for the probability of linkage to be greater than 95 %, the number of RI strains inheriting chromosomes recombinant for the test and marker loci must be smaller than previously assumed. The formulas derived for RI strains can be applied, with only minor modifications, to the analysis of Mendelian backcrosses.

40|$|In the case-parent trio design, {{unrelated}} children affected with {{a disease}} are genotyped {{along with their}} parents. Information may also be collected on environmental factors in the children. The design permits estimation and testing of genetic effects and gene-by-environment interaction. Recently, it has been demonstrated that when genotypes are measured at a non-causal <b>test</b> <b>locus,</b> population stratification can create spurious interaction. That is, the environmental factor can appear to modify the disease risk associated with genotypes at the <b>test</b> <b>locus</b> without modifying the disease risk of genotypes at the causal locus. One design-based approach that is robust to spurious interaction requires the environmental factor to also be available on an unaffected sibling of the affected child. We explore the source of spurious interaction and suggest an alternate approach that mitigates its effects using case-parent triads. Our approach is based on adjusting the risk model using ancestry informative markers or random markers measured on the affected child and does not require data on unaffected siblings. We apply an approach to generating case-parent data, implemented in a freely-available R package soon to be released on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). ...|$|E

40|$|Population {{stratification}} {{remains an}} important issue in case-control studies of disease-marker association, even within populations considered to be genetically homogeneous. Campbell et al. (Nature Genetics 2005; 37 : 868 – 872) illustrated this by showing that stratification induced a spurious association between the lactase gene (LCT) and tall/short status in a European American sample. Furthermore, existing approaches for controlling stratification by use of substructure-informative loci (e. g., genomic control, structured association, and principal components) could not resolve this confounding. To address this problem, we propose a simple two-step procedure. In the first step, we model the odds of disease, given data on substructure-informative loci (excluding the <b>test</b> <b>locus).</b> For each participant, we use this model to calculate a stratification score, which is that participant’s estimated odds of disease calculated using his or her substructure-informative–loci data in the disease-odds model. In the second step, we assign subjects to strata defined by stratification score and then test for association between the disease and the <b>test</b> <b>locus</b> within these strata. The resulting association test is valid even {{in the presence of}} population stratification. Our approach is computationally simple and less model dependent than are existing approaches for controlling stratification. To illustrate these properties, we apply our approach to the data from Campbell et al. and find no association between the LCT locus and tall/short status. Using simulated data, we show that our approach yields a more appropriate correction for stratification than does principal components or genomic control...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Samples {{containing}} DNA {{from two}} or more individuals {{can be difficult to}} interpret. Even ascertaining the number of contributors can be challenging and associated uncertainties can have dramatic effects on the interpretation of testing results. Using an FBI genotypes dataset, containing complete genotype information from the 13 Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) loci for 959 individuals, all possible mixtures of three individuals were exhaustively and empirically computed. Allele sharing between pairs of individuals in the original dataset, a randomized dataset and datasets of generated cousins and siblings was evaluated as were the number of loci that were necessary to reliably deduce the number of contributors present in simulated mixtures of four or less contributors. The relatively small number of alleles detectable at most CODIS loci and the fact that some alleles are likely to be shared between individuals within a population can make the maximum number of different alleles observed at any <b>tested</b> <b>loci</b> an unreliable indicator of the maximum number of contributors to a mixed DNA sample. This analysis does not use other data available from the electropherograms (such as peak height or peak area) to estimate the number of contributors to each mixture. As a result, the study represents a worst case analysis of mixture characterization. Within this dataset, approximately 3 % of three-person mixtures would be mischaracterized as two-person mixtures and more than 70 % of four-person mixtures would be mischaracterized as two- or three-person mixtures using only the maximum number of alleles observed at any <b>tested</b> <b>locus...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} the test-retest variability of the retinal {{sensitivity of the}} Nidek MP 1 microperimeter in patients with macular disease. METHODS. In this prospective study, 50 patients were enrolled {{with a range of}} macular diseases. One examiner performed two consecutive microperimetry tests for all patients using the same test strategy. Test-retest variability for mean sensitivity (MS), mean deviation (MD), point-wise sensitivity (PWS), local defect classification (LDC), average sensitivity for the central macula (CMS, 16 loci inside 10), paracentral macular sensitivity (PMS, 52 loci in the 10 to 20 ring), and dense scotoma size (DSS) were analyzed by calculating the 95 % coefficients of repeatability or percentage agreement. RESULTS. Mean (SD) age and visual acuity were 61 (15) years and 0. 34 (0. 32) logMAR, respectively. The mean difference in MS between tests 1 and 2 was + 0. 2 dB (SD, 0. 9 dB; P = 0. 127). The coefficients of repeatability for MS, MD, CMS, and PMS were 1. 81, 2. 56, 2. 13, and 1. 93 dB, respectively. The mean (SD) of coefficients of repeatability for PWS across all 68 loci was 5. 56 (0. 86) dB. Of all <b>test</b> <b>loci</b> in all patients 76 % had perfect agreement in LDC, and 94 % of patients had a change in DSS of four or fewer <b>test</b> <b>loci.</b> CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|Abstract The ichneumonid wasp Venturia canescens (Hymenoptera) {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} for foraging behaviour and population dynamics of sexually (arrheno-tokous) and parthenogenetically (thelytokous) reproducing individuals. Here we report {{the development of a}} set of microsatellite markers for V. canescens and use them to show that arrhenotokous individuals have more genetic variability than thelytokous ones, which are even homo-zygous for all <b>tested</b> <b>loci.</b> Crosses between arrhenotokous individuals suggested one marker, Vcan 071, to be linked with the Complementary Sex Determiner (CSD) locus and one, Vcan 109, with the Virus Like Protein (vlp-p 40) locus. The genome size of V. canescens was estimated to be 274 – 279 Mb. We discuss how both reproductive modes can give rise to the observed genetic variability and how the new markers can be used for future genetic studies of V. canescens...|$|R
40|$|Fusobacterium nucleatum {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of periodontal diseases. Five subspecies have previously been proposed. The validity of these subdivisions was investigated using allozyme electrophoresis for 21 enzyme mobilities. The 18 F. nucleatum isolates tested had previously been subspeciated and included type strains as well as isolates from both oral and extraoral sites. The results showed 2 distinct genetic groups with fixed differences at 82. 5 % of the <b>test</b> <b>loci,</b> indicative of a species complex {{with a number of}} subspecies within each of the 2 groups. There was also evidence of a correlation between the 2 major groups of isolates and the site from which they were taken. It was concluded that there is a high degree of genetic heterogeneity within the species F. nucleatum and that its current subspeciation is of questionable validity. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Twenty-eight genetic loci are {{associated}} with serum urate levels in Europeans. Evidence for association with gout at most loci is absent, equivocal or not replicated. Our aim was to <b>test</b> the <b>loci</b> for association with gout meeting the American College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria in New Zealand European and Polynesian case-control sample sets...|$|R
