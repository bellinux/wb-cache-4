5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> <b>and</b> willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E

This paper describes the findings of a study that explored perceptions of <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> teaching in one discipline of an Australian dual-sector university from both a student and staff perspective. Teachers&# 039; conceptions of teaching are also explored and provide extra insight and understanding of the approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> teaching taking place. Key findings of this multifaceted study employing a case study with a mixed method approach include a difference between students&# 039; and teachers&# 039; perceptions of approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> teaching.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an empirical study of the relationships among students’ individual characteristics, family contexts, self-efficacy beliefs, <b>learning</b> environments, approaches <b>to</b> teaching and teacher factors, approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> academic attainment, self-directed <b>learning</b> readiness <b>and</b> mental health at a Malaysian private university. For this paper, only the outcome measure of self-directed learning is presented. The study was guided by Kek’s (2006) two-level integrated theoretical framework, designed to examine ‘student and teacher ecological systems’ and their influences on student <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> outcomes in higher education. Data from a large cross-sectional survey and structured in-depth interviews, for both students and teachers was analysed. Single-level quantitative analyses using partial least square path (PLSPATH) and multi-level analyses using the hierarchical linear modelling technique (HLM) were used. The survey data was drawn from a total of 44 PBL classrooms, 392 students and 32 teachers. Interviews were conducted with three teachers and 18 students. The PLSPATH findings revealed that parental involvement continued to influence how students <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> influence outcomes at the university level. A surface approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> was found <b>to</b> be related to poor quality outcomes and a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> was related <b>to</b> high quality outcomes. The HLM analyses revealed which and how teaching factors directly and indirectly influenced approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. The qualitative findings revealed types of parental involvement, peer group effects, complex relationships between memorising and higher cognitive processes in the <b>learning</b> process <b>and</b> effective teaching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> environments for meaningful learning. In this paper, we will present {{a summary of the}} contextual factors that influence approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>and</b> the outcome measure of self-directed learning readiness through two models: one model for a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> self-directed <b>learning,</b> <b>and</b> one for a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> self-directed <b>learning.</b> Holistic measures <b>to</b> develop deep approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> self-directed <b>learning</b> are suggested. ...|$|R

5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{joined his}} local Sea Cadet Corps band {{at the age}} of twelve on the bugle, but found the {{instrument}} too difficult <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> decided to take up drums instead.

On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship among}} student approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> teaching methods on critical thinking in two business units.

Possible explanations for the results are examined and implications for developing critical thinking skills across a degree discussed. What is apparent is that as Universities move towards program-wide level assessment of critical thinking, further work is required {{in terms of the}} design of critical thinking teaching interventions and assessment at the unit, school, and degree level. The session will discuss the challenges in developing critical thinking programs in individual units and at the Faculty level...|$|R

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. South African {{education}} is transforming {{in line with}} the Constitution and the mandates contained in the South African Schools Act of 1996. One of the mandates that education has got to carry out is providing equal quality education for all learners of school-going age, including learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development. The high percentage of learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development who are in centres of <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> are not receiving the appropriate support pose a challenge to the Education Support Services to adopt measures that will ensure access for all learners to support services. Education Support Services personnel in some districts have embarked on a process of implementing the policy of inclusive education as a way of enabling access to centres of learners for learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development. This inquiry focused {{on the role of the}} Education Support Service professionals in the implementation of inclusive education. The research question addresses a sample of Education Support Service professionals' personal views of their role. After a comprehensive literature review, a field study was launched making use of qualitative research methods. The data was collated and interpreted per data category. The themes that emerged from the study suggest that the participants were at the early stages of implementation. The approach adopted was that of facilitating admission of learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development <b>to</b> centres of <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> providing professional support to educators to enable them to cope with the additional professional demands made on them by these admissions. Education Support Services personnel gave reports of providing direct intervention to learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development where educators could not provide the support. Training educators and parents on inclusive education and how to identify learners with barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development and attempting to forge interdepartmental collaborations in order to address barriers <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> development at the centres of learning were some of the activities of the sample group. As the implementation of inclusive {{education is}} still at its initial stages, the study attempted to determine the views of these participants on the roles they were undertaking as well as the roles that they envisage. The study suggests that all stakeholders at the district need to be involved in devising a district strategy for implementing inclusive education that goes beyond catering only for learners with disabilities...|$|R
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> <b>and</b> her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers.

Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
