During that time, the Rangers reached the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Detroit Red Wings. In the 1970s, the Rangers made <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>Finals</b> twice, but were defeated by the Boston Bruins in 1972 and by the Montreal Canadiens in 1979.

5|$|Since 1927, the league's playoff format, {{deciding}} which teams advanced to <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>Finals,</b> has changed multiple times.

From 1942 to 1967, the Cup was competed for by the league's six teams, {{also known as the}} Original Six. After the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Stanley Cup was competed for by the winners of each conference. Since 1982, the Finals have been played between the league's conference playoff champions.|$|E

The Oilers became the first 8th seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>final.</b> <b>The</b> Oilers faced a playoff drought for 10 seasons after their run in 2006-2007, not qualifying for the playoffs until the 2016-2017 season.

5|$|The NHL {{doubled in}} size to 12 teams in 1967–68 and {{organized}} itself into two divisions: the East Division, with the original six teams, and the West Division, which contained the six expansion franchises. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>Finals.</b> The Canadiens recovered from their loss in 1967 to sweep the St. Louis Blues four games to none in both 1968 and 1969 for their 15th and 16th championships.|$|E

5|$|After winning 13 {{games in}} 1922–23, Vézina led the Canadiens into the NHL playoffs, where {{they lost the}} two-game, total-goal series to the Senators, who would win the Stanley Cup. The {{following}} season saw Vézina return to leading the league in fewest goals against. His average of 1.97 goals per game {{was the first time}} a goaltender had averaged fewer than two goals against per game. With another 13-win season in 1923–24, the Canadiens reached the NHL playoffs, where they again faced the Ottawa Senators. This time the Canadiens won the series, then defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA before reaching <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>Finals</b> {{for the first time in}} five years. Playing the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League, Vézina and the Canadiens won the best-of-three series two games to none, as Vézina recorded a shutout in the second game. The championship was the Canadiens' first as a member of the NHL and second title as a club. After a 17-win season in 1924–25 where Vézina recorded a goals-against average of 1.81 to again lead the league, the Canadiens reached <b>the</b> <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>Finals.</b> The Canadiens only qualified after the Hamilton Tigers, the regular season champions, were suspended for refusing to play in the playoffs unless they were paid more.
