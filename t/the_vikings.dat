5|$|In 877 <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf with the west. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.|$|E

50|$|They next {{fight with}} great axe and naginata. <b>The</b> <b>Viking</b> swings his axe but is {{blocked by the}} naginata. The Samurai twists his naginata and forces <b>the</b> <b>Viking's</b> axe out of his hands. He hits <b>the</b> <b>Viking</b> with <b>the</b> naginata, but the damage is reduced by <b>the</b> <b>Viking's</b> chain mail. <b>The</b> <b>Viking</b> recovers his axe and swings viciously at the Samurai. With a heavy blow, he knocks the naginata out of the Samurai's hands and kicks him. <b>The</b> <b>Viking</b> swings his axe at the Samurai's back, but his armor protects him. The Samurai again knocks the axe out of <b>the</b> <b>Viking's</b> hands, this time with his kanabo club. He tries to swing at <b>the</b> <b>Viking,</b> who crouches and blocks with his shield. The Samurai savagely smashes off part of the shield with the kanabo and injures <b>the</b> <b>Viking's</b> arm. <b>The</b> <b>Viking</b> counter-attacks with his shield. He pushes the Samurai {{all the way to}} a bridge and then into a ditch below, where he loses his club.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> have {{selected}} number one overall twice. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> received {{the first pick}} in 1961 as an expansion franchise and then again in 1968 when the franchise chose Ron Yary, an offensive tackle from the University of Southern California. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> have used first-round selections on players from the University of Southern California five times, Michigan State University four times, and from the University of Notre Dame, Oklahoma State University, Ohio State University and Florida State University three times. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> have drafted 10 running backs, the most common position drafted by the franchise, followed by defensive end (9), defensive tackle (8), offensive tackle (7) and linebacker (7). Five eventual Hall of Famers have been selected by <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> in the first-round: Carl Eller, Alan Page, Chris Doleman, Randall McDaniel and Ron Yary.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} year, Grant {{led the team}} to a divisional {{championship}} and his first NFL playoffs appearance. In 1969, he led the team to its first NFL Championship and their first appearance in the Super Bowl. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> lost in Super Bowl IV to the American Football League champion Kansas City Chiefs. Prior to the 1970 season, Minnesota released Joe Kapp. After starting Gary Cuozzo at quarterback in 1970 and 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> re-acquired Fran Tarkenton prior to the 1972 season. During the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> would appear in three more Super Bowls (VIII, IX, and XI) under Grant and lose each one, {{but he was the}} first coach to lead a team to four Super Bowls. He retired after the 1983 NFL season and was succeeded by Les Steckel, who led the team to a 3-13 record the following season. Steckel was fired as head coach after the 1984 season and Grant returned as coach for <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> in 1985. After one season where he returned the club to a 7-9 record, he stepped down again. Grant retired as the eighth most successful coach in NFL history with an overall record of 161 wins, 99 losses, and 5 ties. As of 2014, he also remains the most successful coach in Vikings history.

5|$|Moon {{retained}} {{the starting quarterback}} spot for two seasons, but suffered a broken collarbone halfway through his third season with <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> {{and was replaced by}} Brad Johnson {{for the remainder of the}} season. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> had three starting quarterbacks in the following three seasons– Johnson (1997), Randall Cunningham (1998) and Jeff George (1999)– before Daunte Culpepper began a six-year spell in his second year in the NFL in 2000. He suffered a serious knee injury during the 2005 season, and Johnson took over in the position again, having re-signed the previous summer after seven years away from the franchise. Culpepper then joined the Miami Dolphins in 2006, giving Johnson another full year as starting quarterback , only to be replaced by sophomore Tarvaris Jackson in 2007. The 2008 season commenced with Jackson starting at quarterback, but he was replaced after two games by Gus Frerotte, who was returning to <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> from the St. Louis Rams after having been traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2005.

5|$|The Bears {{returned}} from the bye week by hosting the 4–2 Minnesota Vikings. In their rivalry, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> led the all-time series 55–51–2, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> winning the last game 13–9, though <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> had not beaten the Bears at Soldier Field since 2007. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to protect Jay Cutler; <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> defense sacked Matthew Stafford seven times in week seven, {{with a total of}} 17 in 2015. In eleven career games against Minnesota, Cutler excelled, throwing 23 touchdowns and 13 interceptions, with an 8-3 record. A player that Joniak believed Cutler could attack is cornerback Xavier Rhodes, who allowed four passing touchdowns and a league-worst ten penalties. Additionally, the running backs could target a defense that allowed six yards per carry, one of the worst in the NFL. On defense, the Bears had to watch for Adrian Peterson, who averaged 88 rushing yards per game, including two consecutive games with at least 120 yards in each. Another player was quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who completed 25 passes to eleven players in week seven, while watching for the speed of the Minnesota receiving corps. Despite such successes, as a whole, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> offense was averaging 325.5 yards per game, the third-least in the league. In the red zone, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> scored touchdowns on 42.11 percent of their drives, among the worst in the NFL. Terrance Mitchell, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Jermon Bushrod, Bruce Gaston, Ka'Deem Carey and Cameron Meredith were inactive.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons won {{the coin}} toss {{before the game}} and elected to receive the opening kickoff. They drove down the field and scored first on a five-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Jamal Anderson. On the next drive, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> answered the score with a 31-yard touchdown pass from Cunningham to Moss, tying the game at 7. Neither team scored {{in the remainder of}} the first quarter. In the second quarter, Gary Anderson kicked a field goal after <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> recovered a Falcons fumble to make the score 10–7. After forcing the Falcons to punt on the next drive, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> scored another touchdown on a one-yard run by Cunningham, increasing the lead to 17–7 with five minutes remaining in the first half. The Falcons then lost another fumble, which gave possession back to <b>the</b> <b>Vikings.</b> On the ensuing drive, Moss dropped what would have been a touchdown pass in the end zone, leaving Gary Anderson to kick another field goal to make the score 20–7. After forcing another Falcons punt, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> attempted to increase their lead before halftime, but Falcons lineman Chuck Smith forced a fumble on Cunningham, and the Falcons recovered the ball deep in Vikings territory. The Falcons subsequently scored on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Chris Chandler to Terance Mathis to cut their deficit to 20–14 {{by the end of the}} half.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely {{would have resulted in}} a touchdown and victory for <b>the</b> <b>Vikings.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> won the toss and deferred. Despite a 49-yard kick return by Deonte Thompson, the Bears' struggles began quickly, {{with the}} drive {{stalling}} after a holding penalty on Hroniss Grasu and a sack. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> scored {{on their first}} drive when Stefon Diggs beat Tracy Porter to score on a 15-yard touchdown. <b>The</b> <b>Vikings</b> increased the score with Blair Walsh's 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. After the next two drives ended with punts, Alshon Jeffery caught a ten-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to draw the Bears within three points. On the following series, <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> responded when Teddy Bridgewater escaped a blitz to throw a pass to Jerick McMcKinnon, who beat Shea McClellin to score on the 17-yard play. To start the second half, the Bears attempted an onside kick, and Sherrick McManis recovered. However, after three plays, Brian Robison sacked and stripped Jay Cutler, recovering the fumble; Minnesota took advantage with Stefon Diggs beating Alan Ball to score on the 33-yard touchdown. The Bears decreased the margin to two touchdowns when Robbie Gould kicked a 51-yard field goal; the next three consecutive drives concluded with punts. Afterwards, Cutler's screen pass to Matt Forte was intercepted by Justin Trattou, and <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> capitalized on the turnover with Bridgewater's 12-yard touchdown run, though the Bears retaliated with Cutler's four-yard touchdown pass to Forte. The Bears attempted another onside kick, but failed, and <b>the</b> <b>Vikings</b> later scored again on Zach Line's four-yard touchdown. With 1:50 left in the game, the Bears drove {{as far as the}} Vikings' 28-yard line, but time expired.|$|E
