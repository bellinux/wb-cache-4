Effective semen processing procedures should therefore be implemented to remove bacteria from semen. Unfortunately, technique failure does occur whereby bacteria {{can be found in}} processed sperm preparations. To improve the effectiveness of semen processing, a novel centrifuge <b>tube</b> <b>insert</b> was developed to facilitate the layering of density gradients and semen, and to prohibit the reinfection of purified sperm pellets.

40|$|The {{presence}} of pathogens in semen can compromise {{the outcome of}} assisted reproductive treatment, together {{with the possibility of}} the female partner or offspring becoming infected. This is cause for concern, especially in South Africa with a high prevalence of HIV- 1. Most of these infected individuals are in their reproductive years with the desire to have their own genetically related children. Therefore, assisted reproductive treatment with effective risk reduction procedures, such as semen processing for the elimination of these pathogens is crucial. However, during sperm preparation by standard discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, the supernatant is aspirated to allow access to the purified sperm pellet. Pathogens from the upper layers can adhere to the inside surface of the test tube and flow down to re-infect the purified sperm sample. The use of a centrifuge <b>tube</b> <b>insert</b> may prevent the re-contamination of sperm samples after discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, seminal pathogens can bind specifically or non-specifically to spermatozoa, rendering semen decontamination procedures ineffective. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate viruses and to break pathogen-sperm bonds. However, the addition of a protease to density gradient layers during semen processing could {{have a negative impact on}} sperm parameters. This research was therefore aimed towards the determination of: i) The effect of semen processing with trypsin and trypsin inhibitor on sperm parameters. ii) The prevalence of various bacteria in semen samples from men attending the Reproductive and Endocrine Unit at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. iii) The effectiveness of semen processing by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with a centrifuge <b>tube</b> <b>insert,</b> for the elimination of some of the most prevalent bacteria, white blood cells and in vivo derived HIV- 1. Evaluation of sperm parameters after semen processing indicated that trypsin and trypsin inhibitor did not have an impact on sperm mitochondrial membrane potential, vitality, motility and zona binding potential, or acrosin activity, respectively. Seminal bacteria were highly prevalent in patients wishing to participate in the Unit’s assisted reproductive program, with 49. 5 % of semen samples presenting with positive bacterial cultures. Semen processing by means of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with the <b>tube</b> <b>insert,</b> eliminated significantly more in vitro derived (spiked) bacteria and white blood cells from semen compared to processing without the insert. Furthermore, the semen decontamination procedure was effective in removing HIV- 1 RNA from 100 % of samples and proviral DNA from 98. 1 % of semen samples from HIV- 1 sero-positive patients. The effectiveness of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation for the elimination of seminal pathogens could, therefore, be improved by the addition of trypsin to the upper density layer, without supplementing the bottom layer with trypsin inhibitor. Additionally, semen decontamination efficiency could also be improved by the prevention of re-contamination of processed sperm samples by the utilization of a <b>tube</b> <b>insert</b> during discontinuous density gradient centrifugation.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{attempts}} to find a theoretical solution to prevent tube explosion of the tubes placed in the superheater region of the Bisotoun Power Plant boiler, Iran. The boiler has three types of tube and the tube failure was occurred in the long length type of these tubes. A three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling was carried out for this purpose. The result of modeling of the boiler shows that the long tubes are working in a temperature higher than the designed value. In the present work in order to solve this problem, two different ways was proposed and theoretically investigated. Using of a <b>tube</b> <b>insert</b> in the tube for heat transfer enhancement which increases the cooling performance of the steam inside the tube was the first one. The ability of the <b>tube</b> <b>insert</b> to increasing the heat transfer coefficient and reducing the tube wall temperature was observed from the CFD modeling. However, this way was not accepted due to probability of separating {{a part of the}} welded parts and the consequent danger of the steam turbine placed after the boiler in the plant layout. Using the air blowing system which locally cools the tube in the placed of explosion was also studied. The results show that by this method it is possible to reduce the tube wall temperature to a safe value for the tube.

The heat transfer enhancement in the shell can be supplemented by heat transfer augmentation in tubes using twisted tape inserts or micro-finned tubes. The effect of the thermal resistance of the condensing refrigerant could also be taken into consideration. To assess the benefit of using these techniques extended performance evaluation criteria have been implemented at different constraints. The decrease of the entropy generation can be combined with the relative in crease of the heat transfer rate or the relative reduction of the heat transfer area to find out the geometrical parameters of the tubes for optimal thermodynamics performance.
