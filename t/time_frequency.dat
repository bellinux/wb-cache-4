25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in <b>time</b> <b>frequency</b> {{analysis and}} DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Time</b> - <b>frequency</b> {{analysis}} is nowadays very frequently {{used for the}} evaluation of non - stationary signals, with applications in areas such as radar target imaging and identification, seismic signal interpretation etc. The corresponding two - dimensional (2 D) <b>time</b> - <b>frequency</b> plots, usually called 'spectrograms', are sometimes very useful, because they provide the time - dependence of the signal spectrum, not available in other traditional spectrum estimation methods. In this paper we focus on several <b>time</b> - <b>frequency</b> techniques, like the Short - Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Furthermore, the performance of the Bilinear Time -Frequency Transforms is also carefully examined. The basic idea of <b>time</b> - <b>frequency</b> {{analysis is}} the characterization of the time-varying frequency content of a signal. In this way, additional signal information can be acquired, and ultimately improved target image resolution can be achieved. Finally, <b>time</b> - <b>frequency</b> transforms allow the use of variable parameters, which change according to the <b>time</b> and <b>frequency,</b> in order to achieve the desired target resolution. In this paper, we develop computer codes for the above methods, and simulated synthetic radar data are used for their implementation. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
