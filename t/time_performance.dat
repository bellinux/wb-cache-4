5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the <b>time.</b> <b>Performance,</b> a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Timed {{performance}} in specific motor tasks {{is an essential}} component of a neurological examination applied to children with motor dysfunctions. This article provides centile curves describing normal developmental course and interindividual variation of <b>timed</b> <b>performances</b> of non-disabled children from 5 to 18 years. In a cross-sectional study (n= 662) the following motor tasks were investigated: repetitive finger movements, hand and foot movements, alternating hand and foot movements, sequential finger movements, pegboard, and dynamic and static balance. Intraobserver, interobserver, and test-retest reliability for timed measurements were moderate to high. Timed performances improved throughout the entire prepubertal period, but differed among various motor tasks with respect to increase in speed and when the 'adolescent plateau' was reached. Centile curves of <b>timed</b> <b>performance</b> displayed large interindividual variation for all motor tasks. At no age were clinically relevant sex differences noted, nor did socioeconomic status significantly correlate with <b>timed</b> <b>performance.</b> Our results demonstrate that <b>timed</b> motor <b>performances</b> between 5 and 18 years are characterized by a long-lasting developmental change and a large interindividual variation. Therefore, a well standardized test instrument, and age-specific standards for motor performances are necessary preconditions for a reliable assessment of motor competence in school-age children...|$|R
2500|$|Performance {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for performance throughout its life. [...] Performance is usually defined as {{the speed with which}} a certain operation is executed, or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of <b>time.</b> <b>Performance</b> may be degraded when an operations queue to execute is throttled by limited system capacity. [...] For example, the performance of a packet-switched network is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on statistics, queueing theory and probability theory for its tools and processes.|$|E
