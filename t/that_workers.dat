40|$|The {{theoretical}} discussion {{concerning the}} comparison of employment and wage decisions between capitalist firms and worker cooperatives began with the seminal work of Ward (1958). The model assumes <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> cooperatives maximizes the net income per member instead of total profits. Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has dominated the theoretical literature on worker coops. For instance, some authors have argued <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> coops are not only concerned about income per worker but also employment levels. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. In this article, following the methodology proposed by Craig and Pencavel (1993), we estimate the parameters of a generic objective function. These parameters determine the relative importance <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> coops place on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment. The study is based a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms containing {{the entire population of}} worker coops and conventional firms in 31 3 -digit sectors. Our results support the view <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> coops pursue mixed objectives, including both employment and income per worker. capitalist firms, worker cooperatives, firm objectives...|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E

5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and workers at the factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, {{they thought it was}} solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in trophallaxis (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a disinfectant in order to nest in soil and leaf litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and out in the open. Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days).

5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E

40|$|Worker {{policing}} (any behavior {{performed by}} <b>workers</b> <b>that</b> reduces reproduction by other workers) via egg eating {{has been observed}} in three species of honey bee (Apis mellifera, A. cerana, and A. florea). The maternity of drones of the giant honey bee A. dorsata (n = 660) was determined using DNA microsatellite analysis. None carried markers from the queen's mates indicating that none was a worker's son. In addition, dissection of 1, 902 workers from 8 colonies showed that none had activated ovaries indicating <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> sterility is usual. Worker policing behavior involves costs when police workers make errors: removing eggs laid by a queen or failing to remove worker-laid eggs. We develop a model that examines {{the effect of these}} costs on the acceptance threshold of eggs. The model shows that costs may be reduced by any cues <b>that</b> help police <b>workers</b> distinguish worker-laid and queen-laid eggs. Once such cue may be the use of unique cells for rearing drones and workers. Unlike other Apis, A. dorsata rear both workers and drones in the same-size cells with the drone brood scattered among worker brood. Thus, the ability of A. dorsata workers to detect and eliminate (police) worker-laid eggs may be associated with higher costs than in other species. Our model suggests that these higher costs may select for a more permissive egg-acceptance threshold, because of the costs of erroneously removing queen-laid eggs, leading to greater worker reproduction. However our empirical results suggest <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction is very low in the species, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>worker</b> policing is efficient and <b>that</b> police <b>workers</b> have no difficulty in distinguishing queen-laid and worker-laid eggs...|$|R

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show <b>that</b> <b>workers</b> would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E
