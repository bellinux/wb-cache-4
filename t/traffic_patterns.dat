In foresight of this, the Department of Public Highways took control of a Welland County road between Chambers Corners and Fort Erie on May11, 1927. This roadway, which followed a significant portion of Sherk's Road and the Garrison Road, in addition to a concession road built west from Port Colborne and north through Wainfleet village, was designated as Highway3A.|$|E

5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919.|$|E
5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Between the two cities, it is mostly a rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two regionally important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes {{at one point or}} another as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns.</b> A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

5|$|Surveys of <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> on Bømlo were {{undertaken}} by Hordaland Public Roads Administration in 1984. Based {{on it and}} other feedback, the agency stated that it preferred a pontoon bridge between Foldrøyholmen and Sørstokken, north of the ferry between Bømlo and Stord. It was estimated to cost NOK190 million, in addition to auxiliary roads for NOK40 million. In 1982, plans were launched for a fixed link to the mainland further south, which would include a bridge over Digernessundet, a causeway and low bridge across Spissøysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet. In addition, a tunnel {{would have to be}} built from Føyno to Sveio. This proposal was similar to the finalized Triangle Link. In 1985, an all-tunnel proposal, following the same route, was proposed. Hordaland Public Roads Administration stated that the proposals were unrealistic. The limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS (SBT) was founded in October 1986 by the municipalities of Bømlo, Stord, Fitjar and Sveio, Hordaland County Municipality and five banks.|$|E
5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|With {{the road}} leading from Albany {{northwest}} to Schenectady having been already {{established as a}} turnpike (the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike) in 1797, an all-turnpike route over good quality roads was now available from Albany to Canandaigua. The western extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo soon followed suit and also became an improved Macadam toll road, the Ontario and Genesee Turnpike, in 1805. The Seneca Road Company was authorized {{to create a more}} northerly alternate route of the Seneca Turnpike in 1806. This branch left the original turnpike east of Seneca Falls and crossed more level terrain through Elbridge, Geddes, and Fayetteville before rejoining the old path at Chittenango. As the city of Syracuse developed, <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> changed and the northern branch route became more heavily used than the original road.|$|E
40|$|In SONET/WDM optical networks, a {{wavelength}} {{channel is}} shared by multiple low-rate traffic demands. The multiplex-ing is known as traffic grooming and carried out by SONET add-drop multiplexers (SADM). A key optimization problem in traffic grooming is to minimize the number of SADMs. This op-timization problem is challenging and NP-hard even for unidi-rectional SONET/WDM rings (UPSR) with symmetric unitary traffic demands. In this paper, we give a linear time heuristic algorithm for this NP-hard problem. Empirical {{results show that the}} algorithm outperforms previous algorithms. The al-gorithm uses the minimum number of wavelengths, which are also precious resources in optical networks. An important sub-class of the symmetric unitary <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> is the regular <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern,</b> where each network node appears in exactly r symmetric demands. The regular <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> is a gener-alization of the well known all-to-all <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern,</b> in which r = n− 1 for a network of n nodes. We prove that the optimiza-tion problem remains NP-hard for the regular <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> on the UPSR. We also propose an algorithm for this problem with a better upper bound on the number of used SADMs than previous algorithms. This algorithm always uses the minimum number of wavelengths as well...|$|R

30|$|The SO <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> is {{the most}} {{desirable}} <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern.</b> In this pattern, the total travel time spent on the network (i.e., the network performance index) is minimized. In reality, people follow the shortest path {{which leads to the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> known as UE. In terms of the total travel time spent on the network (also an index for congestion levels), the gap between UE and SO can reach as high as 2.15. In other words, one can significantly improve the congestion level by up to 2.15 times by enforcing a SO pattern rather than a UE <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern.</b> This gap has been the motive for a variety of traffic management (or control) measures and policies such as parking planning, congestion pricing, and ramp metering. The advent of AVs can also be added to these schemes. In what follows, we elaborate on mixed SO-UE traffic flow using Braess’ famous network.|$|R
5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns,</b> the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The open {{wireless}} {{medium in}} a mobile ad-hoc net-work (MANET) enables malicious traffic analysis to dynamically infer the network <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> in hostile environments. The {{disclosure of the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> and its changes is often devas-tating in a mission-critical MANET. A number of anonymous routing protocols have been recently proposed as an effective countermeasure against traffic analysis in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic inference algorithm, called TIA, which enables a passive global adversary to accurately infer the <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> in an anonymous MANET without compromising any node. As the first work of its kind, TIA works on existing on-demand anonymous MANET routing protocols. Detailed simulations show that TIA can infer the <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> with an accuracy as high as 95 %. Our results in this paper highlight the necessity for cross-layer designs to defend a MANET against traffic analysis. I...|$|R

40|$|Recognizing {{temporal}} <b>patterns</b> in <b>traffic</b> flow {{has been}} an important consideration in short-term traffic forecasting research. However, little work has been conducted on identifying and associating <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> occurrence with prevailing traffic conditions. We propose a multilayer strategy that first identifies <b>patterns</b> of <b>traffic</b> based on their structure and evolution in time and then clusters the pattern-based evolution of traffic flow with respect to prevailing traffic flow conditions. Temporal pattern identification is based on the statistical treatment of the recurrent behavior of jointly considered volume and occupancy series; clustering is done via a two-level neural network approach. Results on urban signalized arterial 90 -second traffic volume and occupancy data indicate that <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> propagation exhibits variability with respect to its statistical characteristics such as deterministic structure and nonlinear evolution. Further, <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> clustering uncovers four distinct classes of <b>traffic</b> <b>pattern</b> evolution, whereas transitional traffic conditions can be straightforwardly identified. © 2008 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering...|$|R
