5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in <b>the</b> <b>museums</b> of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes.

It was not known {{at the time that the}} stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E
