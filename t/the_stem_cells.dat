5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E

40|$|Telomere loss at {{each cell}} {{replication}} limits the proliferative capacity of normal <b>cells,</b> including adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Entering replicative senescence protects dividing cells from neoplastic transformation, but {{also contributes to}} aging of the tissue. Recent experiments have shown that intestinal mouse <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> divide symmetrically, at random make decisions to remain <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> or to differentiate, and gradually lose telomeric DNA. A cell’s decision whether to differentiate or to remain a <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> depends on <b>the</b> local cellular and chemical environment and thus tissue architecture is expected to play role in cell proliferation dynamics. To {{take into account the}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche in determining its proliferative potential and susceptibility to cancer, a theoretical model is introduced and the niche proliferative potential is quantified for different architectures. The niche proliferative potential is quantitatively related to the proliferative potential of <b>the</b> individual <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for different structural classes of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> at <b>the</b> periphery of a niche are under pressure to divide and to differentiate, as well as to maintain <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche boundary, and thus the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche is expected {{to play a role in}} determining <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division sequence and differentiation.

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> are <b>the</b> {{source of}} {{differentiated}} cells that constitute tissues and organs. Two fundamental characteristics of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{their abilities to}} self‐renew <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> identity and to produce differentiated cells, the balance {{of which can be}} achieved by asymmetric <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division. Many <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been shown to reside in a <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, <b>the</b> home of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that regulates <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> behavior. Recent studies have revealed the critical contribution of cytoskeletons in achieving asymmetric <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division: mitotic spindles in dividing <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are often oriented with respect to <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, which is supported by concerted actions of microtubule networks and components at the cell membrane such as adherens junctions, the actin cytoskeleton, and the extracellular matrix. In this article, we review <b>the</b> mechanism of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> spindle orientation, with emphasis on its relationship with <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, and discuss how it contributes to tissue development and homeostasis.

30|$|Asymmetric cell {{division}} is {{also influenced by}} <b>the</b> extracellular environment. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{in close contact with}} a special microenvironment, called <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, which is crucial for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> identity and <b>the</b> potential to self-renew (Li & Xie 2005). During division, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> ensure that only one progeny can be in contact with <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche by keeping the perpendicular orientation of their mitotic spindle to the niche surface. The progeny in contact with <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche retains self-renewal ability, while the other undergoes differentiation. Thus, in contrast to the intrinsic mechanism which usually adopts a predefined program, the environmental niche-dependent extrinsic mechanism is relatively flexible (Lechler & Fuchs 2005; Rotundo & Fambrough 1980). It has been known that the extrinsic mechanism plays a critical role for the choice of symmetric or asymmetric divisions in HSCs. HSCs mostly divide asymmetrically when cultured on the layer of osteoblastic cells but undergo symmetric {{cell division}} on the layer of stromal cells, suggesting that HSCs control self-renewal process through interaction with the environmental niche (Knoblich 2008).|$|R

25|$|The {{mammalian}} primary {{olfactory system}} has retained {{the ability to}} continuously regenerate during adulthood.

25|$|A {{potential}} use of {{stem cells}} genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient's particular disease.

For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated his or her somatic cells, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> resulting from SCNT would have genes that contribute to Parkinson's disease.

25|$|Most {{attempts}} at genetic repair have traditionally involved {{the use of}} a retrovirus to insert a new gene into a random position on a chromosome. But by attaching zinc fingers (which determine where transcription factors bind) to endonucleases (which break DNA strands), homologous recombination can be induced to correct and replace defective (or undesired) DNA sequences. The first applications of this technology are to isolate stem cells from the bone marrow of patients having blood disease mutations, to correct those mutations in laboratory dishes using zinc finger endonucleases and to transplant <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> back into the patients.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> secretome, (also {{referred}} to as the stromal cell secretome), is a collective term for the paracrine soluble factors produced by <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and utilized for their inter-cell communication.

25|$|The {{meristem}} can {{be defined}} as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain undifferentiated stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. Their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative meristem or the meristem of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic cell fate determination mechanisms. This means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell’s characteristics (gene WUSCHEL or WUS), and others will act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene CLAVATA or CLV). In this way both mechanisms give rise to a feedback loop, which along with other elements lend a great deal of robustness to the system. Along with the WUS gene the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) gene also represses the differentiation of the meristematic dome. This gene acts by inhibiting the possible differentiation of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> but still allows cell division in the daughter cells, which, had they been allowed to differentiate, would have given rise to distinct organs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe spatial {{organization}} of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into a niche {{is a key}} factor for growth and continual tissue renewal during development, sustenance, and regeneration. Stratified epithelia serve as a great context to study the spatial aspects of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche and cell lineages by organizing into layers of different cell types. Several types of stratified epithelia develop morphologies with advantageous, protruding structures where <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> reside, such as rete pegs and palisades of Vogt.
