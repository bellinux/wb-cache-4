50|$|For convenience, it {{is perhaps}} {{simplest}} to divide the extant reactor designs into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum, which has the natural effect of dividing the reactor designs into those designed to use primarily uranium and <b>transuranics,</b> and those designed to use thorium and avoid <b>transuranics.</b>|$|R
40|$|The FACET {{group at}} CIEMAT is {{studying}} the properties and potentialities of several lead-cooled ADS designs for actinide and fission product transmutation. The main characteristics of these systems are the use of lead as primary coolant and moderator and fuels made by <b>transuranics</b> inside a thorium oxide matrix. The aim {{of the study is}} to analyse the effect of some operation parameters (fuel <b>transuranics</b> composition, thermal power and <b>transuranics</b> recycling scheme) in the ADS performance, mainly in the achieved transmutation rates and in the accelerator requirements. The model selected enhances the energy production by the 233 U breeding from thorium seed. This breeding can maintain the neutron multiplication during long burnups, improving the transmutation capacity. The fuel inventory isotopic evolution during burnup will be presented illustrating the general capabilities of this strategic option for <b>transuranics</b> transmutation. ...|$|R

5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a <b>transuranic</b> {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first <b>transuranic</b> elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the <b>transuranic</b> elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) are to expand {{the use of nuclear}} energy to meet {{increasing}} global energy demand, to address nuclear waste management concerns and to promote non-proliferation. Implementation of the GNEP requires development and demonstration of three major technologies: (1) Light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel separations technologies that will recover <b>transuranics</b> to be recycled for fuel but not separate plutonium from other <b>transuranics,</b> thereby providing proliferation-resistance; (2) Advanced Burner Reactors (ABRs) based on a fast spectrum that transmute the recycled <b>transuranics</b> to produce energy while also reducing the long term radiotoxicity and decay heat loading in the repository; and (3) Fast reactor fuel recycling technologies to recover and refabricate the <b>transuranics</b> for repeated recycling in the fast reactor system. The primary mission of the ABR Program is to demonstrate the transmutation of <b>transuranics</b> recovered from the LWR spent fuel, and hence the benefits of the fuel cycle closure to nuclear waste management. The transmutation, or burning of the <b>transuranics</b> is accomplished by fissioning and this is most effectively done in a fast spectrum. In the thermal spectrum of commercial LWRs, some <b>transuranics</b> capture neutrons and become even heavier <b>transuranics</b> rather than being fissioned. Even with repeated recycling, only about 30 % can be transmuted, which is an intrinsic limitation of all thermal spectrum reactors. Only in a fast spectrum can all <b>transuranics</b> be effectively fissioned to eliminate their long-term radiotoxicity and decay heat. The Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) {{is the first step in}} demonstrating the transmutation technologies. It directly supports development of a prototype full-scale Advanced Burner Reactor, which would be followed by commercial deployment of ABRs. The primary objectives of the ABTR are: (1) To demonstrate reactor-based transmutation of <b>transuranics</b> as part of an advanced fuel cycle; (2) To qualify the transuranics-containing fuels and advanced structural materials needed for a full-scale ABR; and (3) To support the research, development and demonstration required for certification of an ABR standard design by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The ABTR should also address the following additional objectives: (1) To incorporate and demonstrate innovative design concepts and features that may lead to significant improvements in cost, safety, efficiency, reliability, or other favorable characteristics that could promote public acceptance and future private sector investment in ABRs; (2) To demonstrate improved technologies for safeguards and security; and (3) To support development of the U. S. infrastructure for design, fabrication and construction, testing and deployment of systems, structures and components for the ABRs. Based on these objectives, a pre-conceptual design of a 250 MWt ABTR has been developed; it is documented in this report. In addition to meeting the primary and additional objectives listed above, the lessons learned from fast reactor programs in the U. S. and worldwide and the operating experience of more than a dozen fast reactors around the world, in particular the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II have been incorporated into the design of the ABTR to the extent possible...|$|R

5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive <b>transuranic</b> {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth <b>transuranic</b> element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the <b>transuranic</b> elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been <b>transuranic</b> elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some <b>transuranic</b> elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the <b>transuranic</b> elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russiaâ€“US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the waste}} from a breeder reactor has a {{different}} decay behavior, because it {{is made up of}} different materials. Breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products, while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of <b>transuranics.</b> After spent nuclear fuel has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100,000 years, these <b>transuranics</b> would be the main source of radioactivity. Eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel.|$|R
40|$|Keeping LWR {{plutonium}} {{mixed with}} other <b>transuranics</b> and with lanthanide fission products other than 154 Eu {{does not make}} it significantly more self protecting or more difficult to fabricate into a nuclear weapon. Gamma-ray and neutron doses at one meter, heat generation, and spontaneous-neutron emission are calculated from 1 -kg metal balls of weapon-grade plutonium, reactor-grade plutonium, and the full mix of <b>transuranics</b> in high-burnup light-water-reactor (LWR) spent fuel with and without the lanthanide fission products from the spent fuel. The total radiation dose rate from <b>transuranics</b> without the lanthanides is more than three orders of magnitude lower than the IAEAâ€™s threshold for self-protection, 1 Sv/hr (100 rems/hr) at 1 meter. In-clusion of either of two lanthanide fission products, 144 Ce and 154 Eu, could increase the dose rate above the self-protection threshold. However, 144 Ce has a half-life of only 0. 8 years and has already decayed away in all but the most recently discharged LWR spent fuel. 154 Eu has a half-life of nine years but is not recycled with the <b>transuranics</b> in the pyroprocessing fuel cycle that was developed for the Integrated Fast Reactor...|$|R

5|$|Berkelium is a <b>transuranic</b> {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbolBk and atomic number 97. It {{is a member}} of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the <b>transuranic</b> element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium was {{the ninth}} <b>transuranic</b> element to be {{synthesized}}. It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory Robert Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced 256Md (half-life of 77 minutes) when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting {{of only a}} billion (109) einsteinium atoms with alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch cyclotron, thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. 256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced. This discovery {{was part of a}} program, begun in 1952, that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides. This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize <b>transuranic</b> elements, neutron capture, could not work {{because of a lack of}} known beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to spontaneous fission of 258Fm that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.|$|E
50|$|Fast {{breeder reactor}} or FBR uses fast (unmoderated) {{neutrons}} to breed fissile plutonium and possibly higher <b>transuranics</b> from fertile uranium-238. The fast spectrum is flexible {{enough that it}} can also breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, if desired.|$|R
40|$|A Lead Bismuth-cooled {{fast reactor}} concept for {{actinide}} burning and low-cost electricity production and excellent safety characteristics is proposed.

The small negative fuel temperature and coolant temperature reactivity coefficients and negative core radial expansion coefficient provide self-regulating characteristics, so that the reactor is capable of inherent shutdown in major transients without scram, as in the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) ...|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{breeder reactor}} use thermal {{spectrum}} (moderated) neutrons to breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium (thorium fuel cycle). Due {{to the behavior}} of the various nuclear fuels, a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel, which avoids the buildup of the heavier <b>transuranics.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier <b>transuranic</b> elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{protactinium}} isotopes, 231Pa and 233Pa, {{are produced}} from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable {{and are usually}} removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231Pa. The last isotope, while not a <b>transuranic</b> waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is {{a major contributor to}} the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The <b>transuranic</b> elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
50|$|In principle, breeder fuel cycles can recycle {{and consume}} all actinides, leaving only fission {{products}}. As the graphic {{in this section}} indicates, fission products have a peculiar 'gap' in their aggregate half-lives, such that no fission products have a half-life longer than 91 years and shorter than two hundred thousand years. As {{a result of this}} physical oddity, after several hundred years in storage, the activity of the radioactive waste from a Fast Breeder Reactor would quickly drop to the low level of the long-lived fission products. However, to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of <b>transuranics</b> from spent fuel. If the fuel reprocessing methods used leave a large fraction of the <b>transuranics</b> in the final waste stream, this advantage would be greatly reduced.|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory has {{developed}} a composite ceramic waste form for the disposition of high level radioactive waste produced during electrometallurgical conditioning of spent nuclear fuel. The electrorefiner LiCl/KCl eutectic salt, containing fission products and <b>transuranics</b> in the chloride form, is contacted with a zeolite material which removes the fission products from the salt. After salt contact, the zeolite is mixed with a glass binder. The zeolite/glass mixture is then hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) to produce the composite ceramic waste form. The ceramic waste form provides a durable medium that is well suited to incorporate fission products and <b>transuranics</b> in the chloride form.

5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The <b>transuranic</b> elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis.
