It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>are</b> tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

The Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh, in 1656 helped {{organize}} and publish a collection of 50 Upanishads translated into the Persian language, with the title of Oupanekhat; in this collection the Jabala Upanishad is listed at number 29 and [...] "Jabala" [...] is spelled [...] "Djabal". This Persian translation was itself translated into Latin by Anquetil du Perron in 1801–02, wherein Anquetil remarked that <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>are</b> reading this collection of Upanishads all the time [...] "knowing it to be the best book on religion". The Anquetil translation brought the Upanishads to the attention of Arthur Schopenhauer and other western philosophers.|$|E

500|$|Word quickly {{spread among}} the Native American tribes of Standish's attack; many Native Americans {{abandoned}} their villages and fled the area. As noted by Philbrick: [...] "Standish's raid had irreparably damaged the human {{ecology of the}} region .... It was some time before a new equilibrium came to the region." [...] Edward Winslow reports in his 1624 memoirs Good News from New England that [...] "they forsook their houses, running to and fro like men distracted, living in swamps and other desert places, and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, whereof very many are dead". Lacking the trade in furs provided by the local tribes, the Pilgrims lost their main {{source of income for}} paying off their debts to the Merchant Adventurers. Rather than strengthening their position, Standish's raid had disastrous consequences for the colony, as attested by William Bradford {{in a letter to the}} Merchant Adventurers: [...] "e had much damaged our trade, for there where we had [...] most skins <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>are</b> run away from their habitations". The only positive effect of Standish's raid seemed to be the increased power of the Massasoit-led Wampanoag tribe, the Pilgrims' closest ally in the region.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950 Technicolor western, Comanche Territory, O'Hara {{played an}} unusual {{role as the}} lead {{character}} of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights like a man, with hair tied back. She [...] "mastered the American bullwhip" [...] during the filming, [...] in a role which Crowther believed was [...] "more significant than a setting sun" [...] in that she [...] "tackles her assignment with so much relish {{that the rest of}} the cast, even <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> <b>are</b> completely subdued." [...] She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O'Hara then appeared as Countess D'Arneau opposite John Payne in Tripoli, directed by O'Hara's second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the western Rio Grande, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O'Hara declared that [...] "from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me". Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful that over the years many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, Flame of Araby (1951). O'Hara [...] "despised" [...] the film and everything it stood for, [...] but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that point of time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than the ones she had done thus far.|$|E

We hope the Indians will apply the same logic to Kashmir. Now the Indians can impress their electorate with having achieved military glory. The mask is off.

In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. [...] McCreight was the “Indian Man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying: [...] "Get up quick, <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>are</b> out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, {{and see what you}} can do with them!" [...] McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and protect the rights of these abused natives.” ...|$|E
