2500|$|In Malaysia, {{the master}} {{franchisee}} agreement was terminated on 5 January 2017 by La Kaffa International due to contractual dispute with its country master franchisee, Loob Holdings. This legal dispute {{attracted the attention}} of local media and is currently in arbitration in Singapore. La Kaffa held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur announcing it would be taking over the Malaysian Chatime business operations and development with immediate effect. [...] This however appears to be largely incorrect with Loob Holdings rebranding 161 out of 165 Chatime outlets to Tealive brand on 17 February 2017. Due to Loob Holdings' alleged use of unapproved ingredients (which were later found out to be collaborations with other brands for locallization purposes [...] ), questionable practices, and a blatant breach of the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> La Kaffa International director Chen Zhao sought an injunction against the former master franchisee from operating a similar (bubble tea) business in Malaysia. On 29 May 2017, the High Court dismissed the injunction bid by La Kaffa International, against Loob Holding Sdn Bhd, from carrying a similar business as Chatime. Judicial Commissioner Wong Kian Kheong, in his oral judgement, ruled that the injunction would cause great risk of injustice to Loob Holding and its business and also associates. The court also found that the franchise termination by La Kaffa was done in bad faith. While both companies have taken their dispute to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, La Kaffa reportedly tries to persuade LooB Holdings to settle this matter outside court.|$|E
