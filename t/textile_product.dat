This study  is aimed to analyze the efficiency and productivity as performance indicators and how the efficiency and import penetration affect the productivity of {{textile industry}} and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> The methods of data analysis used in this research are divided in two phases. The first phase, the non-metric approach of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to measure the efficiency and productivity. Secondly, the fixed effect model of econometric regression approach is used to find out the effects of efficiency and import penetration on the productivity of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> The result shows that the average level of efficiency of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> during the period of 2004 – 2008 is about 40 percent with a growth rate of average productivity increases 2. 4 percent. Whereas, the econometric estimation results indicate that the increase of efficiency will positively and significantly affect the productivity of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> On the other hand, the increase of import penetration will negatively affect the productivity of this industry.
