5|$|Taurodontism is a {{condition}} where {{the body of the}} tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with Klinefelter syndrome, Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and XYY syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{occurs in}} around 1 in 1,000 girls. On average, {{five to ten}} girls with <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> are born in the United States each day.|$|E
25|$|Some {{females with}} <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{have an extra}} X {{chromosome}} in only some of their cells. These cases are called 46,XX/47,XXX mosaics.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} {{the introduction of}} cell-free fetal DNA testing (NIPT - Non Invasive Prenatal Testing) in routine clinical practice emphasizing its high sensibility and specificity. In any case, false positive and false negative findings may result from placental mosaicism, because cell-free fetal DNA originates mainly from placenta. Case: we report six cases of women who underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis to confirm the results from NIPT: two Turner <b>syndromes,</b> two <b>Triple</b> <b>X,</b> one Patau <b>syndrome,</b> one Edward syndrome. Results: using classic cytogenetic analysis and, also, Array - Comparative Genomic Hybridization(Array CGH) the karyotype of all 5 fetuses {{was found to be}} normal. Conclusion: results from NIPT must always be confirmed by invasive prenatal diagnosis. It is mandatory to inform the patient that the CVS and amniocentesis still represent the only form of prenatal diagnostic test available...|$|R
50|$|As 2000 began, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> {{had become}} the top tag team of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. On March 3, Thompson and Dawson {{defeated}} Team Extreme for their first NWA World Tag Team Title. On March 17, <b>Triple</b> <b>X's</b> Northern Continental Tag Team Championship was renamed the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship. Holding both the titles, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> eventually lost the World Tag Team Championship to Main Event (Reno Riggins and Steven Dunn) on April 5. On April 19, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> defeated L.A. Stephens and Big Bubba Pain for their second NWA World Tag Team Title. <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> held the title for 118 days. On August 15, Jeff Justice substituted for Dawson and teamed with Thompson during a title defense against Bad Attitude (David Young and Rick Michaels). Thompson and Justice lost the titles. In September 2000, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> vacated the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Title due to Dawson retiring from professional wrestling. As a result, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> disbanded.|$|R

25|$|<b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{also known}} as trisomy X and 47,XXX, is {{characterized}} by the presence of an extra X chromosome in each cell of a female.

Occasionally there are learning difficulties, decreased muscle tone, seizures, or kidney problems.|$|E
50|$|They began feuding with Naturals {{while they}} also feuded with <b>Triple</b> <b>X.</b> On September 1, Naturals {{defeated}} <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> and AMW in a triple threat tag team match {{to retain the}} tag titles. The next week, Storm wasn't cleared to wrestle while Christopher Daniels was injured, so AMW's Harris teamed up with <b>Triple</b> <b>X's</b> Elix Skipper to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Naturals. On September 24 edition of Impact!, Storm teamed up with Daniels to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They ended up losing the titles to Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young) on October 15 edition of Impact!. AMW entered a feud with <b>Triple</b> <b>X.</b> They defeated them in an Elimination Last Man Standing match at Victory Road 2004. After that, they agreed to a Six Sides of Steel match at Turning Point 2004 where the losing team would separate. AMW won the grueling match, ending <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> and winning the feud once and for all.|$|R

40|$|It is {{believed}} that the occurrence of females with a <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> karyotype is probably higher than previously suspected. Thus, the woman in our case was discovered after she {{had given birth to}} a child with Turner's syndrome. There was nothing about her menstrual history and physical appearance that would have indicated that she possessed an extra X chromosome. While a number of <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> females have given birth, the offspring had been chromosomally normal, until Singer et al (1972) reported a <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> case and a Down's syndrome offspring. The case of the present report is the second example of a <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> female producing a child with a chromosomal abnormality, and to our knowledge the first case of Turner's syndrom...|$|R
25|$|<b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be {{diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of triple X females are never diagnosed, it may be very difficult to make generalizations about the effects of this syndrome. The samples that were studied were small and may be nonrepresentative. Because of the lyonization, inactivation, and formation of Barr bodies in all female cells, only one X chromosome is active at any time. Thus, <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> most often has only mild effects or has no effects. The symptoms vary from person to person, with some women being more affected than others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not inherited, but usually, {{occurs as}} an event during the {{formation}} of reproductive cells (ovum and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with additional chromosomes. For example, an oocyte or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the X chromosome {{as a result of}} the non-disjunction. If one of these cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra X chromosome in each of her cells. In some cases, trisomy X occurs during cell division in early embryonic development.|$|E
50|$|On July 15, 2007 at Victory Road, Skipper {{returned}} to TNA, competing in an Ultimate X match and reforming <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> with Daniels and Senshi (the former Low Ki). On the July 19 episode of Impact!, <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> won its return match against Serotonin. On the following Impact!, Daniels and Senshi won a match against Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt with some outside interference from Skipper. <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> {{would go on}} to lose to The Latin American Xchange during Bound For Glory in an Ultimate X Match.|$|R
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>triple</b> <b>X</b> women are never diagnosed, unless they undergo tests for other medical reasons later in life. <b>Triple</b> <b>X</b> can be diagnosed by a blood test which is {{able to look at}} a person’s chromosomes (karyotype). Abnormalities on the electroencephalography may be present.|$|R
