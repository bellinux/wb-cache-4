500|$|In the summer, the 45th did its {{training}} at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, after which Middleton was in command for winter {{training at}} Pine Camp, New York. Here the temperature dipped to 36 {{degrees below zero}} (F) and snow drifted head-high. A soldier in the division {{by the name of}} Bill Mauldin did a cartoon showing slop from the kitchen frozen in a column as it descended into <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> outside. Mauldin later became famous for his cartoons during World War II, and won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. [...] In February 1943 the training moved from Pine Camp to Camp Pickett, Virginia for mountain training, and then to the Atlantic Coast for ship-to-shore training between Norfolk, Virginia and Solomons, Maryland. In early April, while the division was at Camp Pickett, Middleton was sent to North Africa with some of his staff to begin planning the ensuing military operation. Here he went to the headquarters of the Seventh Army commander, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, in Morocco and stayed nearly a month. Patton would command the Seventh Army in the Sicily landings during the summer, and the 45th would be the only combat-loaded division coming from the United States. With the division scheduled to sail from Norfolk on 5 June, Middleton left beforehand to complete the planning for the landing on a hostile shore, this time reporting to the II Corps headquarters of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley in Algiers, Algeria. For this operation, Bradley was subordinate to Patton, under British overall direction. By the time the division arrived in Oran, Algeria, the planning was complete, and the unit was able to run one rehearsal in western Algeria before embarking for Sicily.|$|E

According to DNA Security, the fingernail DNA showed some characteristics similar to lacrosse player David Evans's DNA. However, the match was not conclusive, as 2% of the male population (including Evans) could not be excluded based on the sample. In addition, because Evans lived in the house, defense attorneys contended that any DNA present might {{have come from the}} tissue paper, cotton swabs, or other hygiene-related trash that had been in <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> along with the fingernail. This was confirmed later by Attorney General Cooper's investigation: [...] "... to the extent that Evans's DNA could not be excluded, the SBI experts confirmed that the DNA could easily have been transferred to the fingernails from other materials in the trash can".|$|E

2500|$|The video {{starts with}} an acting {{sequence}} in which JoJo confronts her boyfriend David, played by junior defender Mike Zaher, after she spots {{him at a}} house party flirting with another girl, with a drink in his hand. In the dramatic opening scene, JoJo is very upset. The couple talk and David finally invites JoJo to an important soccer game for his team. As the video progresses, JoJo sings {{next to the window}} in her room. She walks around the room looking at photos, reminiscing about the time they spent together and how generally ungrateful he was. These shots are intercut with David playing at the important soccer game. In the video's finale, rain begins to pour on the game. We see JoJo taking down photographs of the couple and picking up a stuffed animal that David had bought her in happier times. She takes it outside and throws it in <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b> It is raining, proving that this is the same moment as the game and she has chosen not to attend. David's team is down one goal with 2:14 seconds remaining in the second half. As he makes the shot for the home team, JoJo sings in the rain. He is not quick enough, failing to score the tying goal and the game ends, suggesting that JoJo's absence from the game has had an unfavourable effect on his performance. The video ends with the camera zooming out and panning away from JoJo's window as the rain subsides. Noticeable in the video is a poster for the Rockcorps Boost Mobile concert at Radio City Music Hall on September 24, 2005, an ad for Q-Tip's single [...] "For the Nasty", and the book [...] "Riding on a Blue Note: Jazz and American Pop" [...] by Gary Giddins, which she is reading on top of the car at the game.
