5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. London's main port is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks. Various wharves along the river continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> but on a much smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled. Originally three {{sides of the}} Mole served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from the Mole for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> on the siding serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E

50|$|From the 17th to {{the early}} 20th century, very heavy, {{relatively}} immobile siege mortars were used, of up to one metre calibre, often made of cast iron and with an outside barrel diameter many {{times that of the}} bore diameter. An early example was Roaring Meg used during The English Civil War. Smaller and more portable designs were introduced during the First World War, primarily for trench warfare, which took place at relatively close ranges. Mortars continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>used</b> by militaries <b>to</b> the present day.|$|R
