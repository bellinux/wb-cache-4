At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the land}} routes between the Song and Jin were {{controlled}} by the Liao, diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the Bohai Sea. Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the Song wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans. Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118, while Jurchen envoys arrived in the Song capital Kaifeng the next year. At the beginning the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat. In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that the Song had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered the Song only parts of <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Prefectures. Among other things, the Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of Datong at {{the western end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Prefectures. The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital, whereas the Song would seize the Liao Southern Capital, Yanjing (modern day Beijing).|$|E

The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border region known as <b>the</b> <b>Sixteen</b> Prefectures in return.
