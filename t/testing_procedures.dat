During the Second World War, Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine's chief test pilot, {{in charge of}} flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine. He oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area. Quill devised the standard <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of total production.|$|E

Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve {{the way in which}} the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E

40|$|Following (1), (2) and (3), who {{proposed}} {{a test of}} uniformity based on m-th order disjoint sample spacings, we propose its analog based on m-th order overlapping sample spacings.

Asymptotic, normality of the proposed test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives. The proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be consistent against a large class of alternatives. For a sequence of local alternatives, which, converges to the null hypothesis at the rate of n(- 1 / 4), the proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with three existing <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. the Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed in (4), which is known to be locally most powerful among all <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> based symmetrically on spacings, a procedure due to (5) and a procedure due to (3)), in terms of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency.

40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and in the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and to compare test results to research results from field tests. Overall, the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows a reduction in the total site energy consumption of about 3 percent for two-stage compared to single-stage furnaces at the same efficiency level. In contrast, the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows almost no difference in the total site energy consumption. The 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> appears to provide a better methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces.

25|$|Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was {{suggested}} {{that this is not the}} reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> fully.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Chamberlayne Billard (22 September 187317 May 1932) {{served as}} the sixth Commandant of the United States Coast Guard from 1924 until his death.

Among his experiences before becoming Commandant, Billard commanded several cutters, served as aide to two Commandants and also served twice as superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy. After rising through the ranks, he was appointed to serve as Commandant in January 1924 and with the appointment, the rank of rear admiral. His leadership of the Coast Guard during the prohibition era required careful planning and use of available resources to accomplish the mission while making sure that other required missions weren't slighted.
