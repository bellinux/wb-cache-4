5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E

In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Many {{appointments}} by {{the governor}} are subject to <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> and consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state Senate, however a Senate vote is only for disapproval of an appointment as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> and consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate for a presidential appointment which is required before a nominee takes office.|$|R

Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 {{and continues to be}} involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.|$|E

50|$|Northern Territory: In the Northern Territory, <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> Administrator is a {{permanent}} appointment, and since the territory was granted self-government in 1978, <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> Administrator has become a largely ceremonial appointment, like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Governor in each State. Unlike the Governors, who are appointed by <b>The</b> Sovereign on <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Premier, the Administrator is appointed by <b>the</b> Governor-General on <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister after consultation with the Chief Minister.|$|R

Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk {{about the need for}} a military dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{judiciary}} {{plays an}} important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief Justice). Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with nongovernmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.|$|E
