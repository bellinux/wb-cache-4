50|$|The Macintosh {{featured}} a real-time clock counting seconds, and a countdown timer with near-microsecond resolution. The former {{was connected to}} the 6522 by a serial bus on three general-purpose I/O lines. It functioned much as a quartz watch when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> <b>powered</b> off. <b>The</b> latter was built into the 6522 itself. Either could generate interrupts.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} command will assign {{slightly different}} power management settings for circumstances where <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by the charger. Here, {{the machine is}} set to sleep after 30 minutes and the display is set to never sleep, but only when set by the charger. Issuing both commands will not interfere with each other.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{one form}} of {{out-of-band}} management is sometimes called lights-out management (or LOM) and {{involves the use of}} a dedicated management channel for device maintenance. It allows a system administrator to monitor and manage servers and other network-attached equipment by remote control regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> on, or if an operating system is installed or functional.|$|E
50|$|Generally, 32-bit {{addressing}} is {{only needed}} when {{large amounts of}} RAM are needed or when a piece of software requires it. Running non-32-bit-clean software in 32-bit mode on any Macintosh can cause crashes and data corruption. With MODE32 installed, holding down the Esc key on the keyboard as soon as <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> on causes the system to run in 24-bit mode for the current session.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} while Leonardo da Vinci {{was under}} the patronage of Ludovico Sforza in 1487. Sometimes described as a prototype of modern tanks, da Vinci's armored vehicle represented a conical cover inspired by a turtle’s shell. Tohe covering was {{to be made of}} wood and reinforced with metal plates that add to thickness. Slanting angles would deflect enemy fire. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> <b>powered</b> by two large inside cranks operated by four strong men. The vehicle was equipped with an array of light cannons, placed around the perimeter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by two {{symmetric}} springs. While {{one spring}} {{would be enough}} to move the device, two symmetric springs probably looked like a more [...] "logically perfect" [...] solution. Leonardo had been well aware that the powering force provided by the springs drops significantly when they unwind. In order to deliver smooth and stable motion, the machine features a balance wheel, as used in clocks. The control mechanism is quite complex and allows it to follow a pre-programmed path automatically. The machine also features a mechanism similar to a differential that also allows the turning angle to be set.|$|E
50|$|The robot is {{approximately}} 3.0 to 3.7 meter in height {{with a similar}} dimension in width and is made primarily from scrap metal and aluminum tubing. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by a central electric motor system that mechanically transfers energy to the legs. To walk, the machine lifts 3 of its legs forward while pushing the remaining 3 legs backward against the ground in an alternating cycle. The system is designed {{in such a way}} that it can seamlessly adjust its direction of movement based on the rotation of the drive section located at the center of the machine. As of 2010, the robot had no onboard power system in place yet and during initial testing had to be tethered to external power sources.|$|E
5000|$|Commodore 64 coder Steve Ruddy {{recalled}} in Retro Gamer: [...] It wasn't daunting originally, {{as it looked}} like a fairly straightforward platform and sprite game. However, once you start playing you noticed how the bubbles followed air flow patterns and how they all gathered in fixed places - lots of sprites on the same line meant a sprite multiplexer wasn't suitable. Fortunately, having worked on the BBC Micro and Mystery of the Nile, I wasn't averse to using software sprites. ... We didn't understand all of the secrets so we just implemented the game to mimic what we did notice. So how the pick-ups appear isn't the same as the arcade on the C64, but it should be very similar to how the pickups appear after <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these devices to be widely used however was {{developed}} by Drinker and Shaw in 1928.

50|$|The IBM Personal Computer {{included}} ROM-based firmware {{called the}} BIOS; {{one of the}} functions of that firmware was to perform a power-on self test when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> <b>powered</b> up, and then to read software from a boot device and execute it. Firmware compatible with the BIOS on the IBM Personal Computer is used in IBM PC compatible computers. The Extensible Firmware Interface was developed by Intel, originally for Itanium-based machines, and later also used {{as an alternative to}} the BIOS in x86-based machines, including Apple Macs using Intel processors.|$|R
5000|$|Between December 2014 and March 2016, {{the band}} {{uploaded}} several YouTube videos featuring Martin Molin documenting {{the construction of}} a music box that uses marbles to play instruments. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by hand, and works by raising steel marbles through the machine into multiple feeder tubes, where they are then released from height via programmable release gates, falling and striking an instrument below. All the instruments are played by striking them and include a vibraphone, bass guitar, cymbal, and emulated kick drum, high hat and snare drum sounds using contact microphones. The music score is stored on two programmable wheels that utilise Lego Technic beams and stud connectors to trigger armatures to release the marbles. A final music video showing the machine in use was released in 2016. [...] The video counts more than 53 million views on YouTube [...]|$|E
5000|$|Neuronoid Robots jointly {{created by}} Akamatsu Industries and Mode Warp. As <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by Linker Gel, two Dual Kind are {{required}} to pilot it. Each Neuronoid has two forms: The [...] "Accept Mode", which {{is equipped with a}} variety of sensors used for surveying and analysis, and the [...] "Active Mode", used in combat situations. A Neuronoid's most powerful ability is the Synapse Attack, where particles from the environment surrounding the machine are drawn in, and then unleashed in a powerful blast. Due to the rate at which Linker Gel becomes unusable, the Neuronoids can only remain active for a short time, which is one of their major handicaps. Neuronoids use living brain matter in their construction. Although human brains were originally used in early models, the current Neuronoids piloted by the protagonists use the brains of primates and dolphins.|$|E
50|$|Batman and the Flash first {{travel to}} the Stone Age, where Wonder Woman has been placed. While the Flash stays behind to power the machine and {{keep it in the}} time period that it is in, as <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by the Flash running on it, Batman goes to rescue Wonder Woman. Shortly afterwards, Batman is {{captured}} and taken to a tribe of cave dwellers, which Wonder Woman is revealed to be in charge of. Batman discovers that Wonder Woman lost her memories {{as a result of her}} time travel, such that she now believes herself to be the queen of the cave dwellers. Batman then manages to obtain Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, which he uses to restore her memories. After her memories are restored, she is teleported to the present to stabilize the time stream. Batman then rejoins the Flash and travels to the 1600s, where Green Lantern has become convinced that he is a deckhand on a pirate ship; Batman restores Green Lantern's memories with his power ring, causing Green Lantern to return to the present.|$|E
50|$|The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) was {{introduced}} on the Apple IIGS in 1986. This peripheral bus {{was intended to}} connect low-speed input devices like keyboards and computer mice. Looking for a low-cost connector, the design team selected the 4-pin mini-DIN connector, which is also used for S-Video. ADB only used one data pin and +5V and ground, leaving one pin free. This was used to implement the PSW connection, used to turn on <b>the</b> <b>machine.</b> A separate connection was required as the keyboard controller of machines of this era <b>was</b> not <b>powered</b> when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> <b>powered</b> down.|$|R

5000|$|Initial Program Load (IPL)PoOps is {{a process}} for loading a program when there isn't a loader {{available}} in storage, usually because <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> just <b>powered</b> on or to load an alternative operating system. This process is sometimes known as Booting.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} {{used in the}} drop forming process {{is commonly known as}} a power or drop hammer. These may be powered by air, hydraulics, or mechanics. Depending on how <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered,</b> the mass of the ram, and the drop height, the striking force can be anywhere from 11,000 to 425,000 pounds.The tools that are used, dies and punches, come in many different shapes and sizes, as well as materials. Examples of these shapes are flat and v-shaped which are used for open-die forging, and single or multiple-impression dies used for closed die-forging. The designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered. They all must be properly aligned, they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves, and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location. The materials must also be selected carefully. Some factors that go into the material selection are cost, their ability to harden, their ability to withstand high pressures, hot abrasion, heat cracking, and other such things. The most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and, in some cases, nickel based alloys.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Scalar {{control of}} {{induction}} servomotors was implemented on their steady-state model. If <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> via a frequency and voltage converter, {{due to the}} presence in the motor input voltage wave of higher time harmonics, both its parameters and functional characteristic values will {{be more or less}} different comparing to the case of sinusoidal supply. The presence of these harmonics will result in the appearance of a distorting regime in the machine, with adverse effects in operation. In this work is realized a theoretical study of the behavior of the asynchronous servomotor in the presence of distorting (non-sinusoidal) regime and also a mathematical model for its scalar control is proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{method of}} primary {{processing}} of coffee {{is a vital}} determinant of quality and price. Wet processing method produces higher quality beans but is very labourious. This work outlines {{the design of a}} small scale cost-effective ergonomic and easily maintained and operated coffee hulling machine that can improve quality and productivity of green coffee beans. The machine can be constructed from locally available materials at a relatively low cost of about NGN 140000. 00 with cheap running cost. The beaters are made from rubber strip which can deflect when in contact with any obstruction causing little or no stresses on drum members and reducing the risk of damage to both the beans and machine. The machine is portable and detachable which make it fit to be owned by a group of farmers who can move it from one farm to the other making affordability and running cost easier. The easily affordable and relatively low running cost may be further reduced by the fact that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> by 3. 0 Hp petrol engine which is suitable for other purposes among the rural dwellers. The eventual construction of the machine will encourage more farmers to go into wet processing of coffee and reduce the foreign exchange hitherto lost to this purpose...|$|E

25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>are</b> <b>powered</b> down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up.

A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> restored.
