5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> {{recognise}} that it {{was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

Although {{the courts}} later confiscated the film {{based on a}} citizen's complaint, the initial {{audience}} reaction was positive. After seeing the film, director Sergio Leone {{wrote a letter to}} Deodato, which stated, [...] " [...] Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> get in trouble with all the world." [...] In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million; in Japan it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after E.T. the Extraterrestrial. Internationally, it grossed $200 million.|$|E

[...] He also liked to evoke familiar musical styles, {{such as his}} madrigals in The Mikado, Ruddigore and The Yeomen of the Guard, glees in H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado and gavottes in Ruddigore and The Gondoliers. In The Sorcerer, there is a country dance in [...] "If you'll marry me". [...] In Ruddigore, the sailor character dances a hornpipe, while in The Mikado, Sullivan quotes a Japanese war song in [...] "Miya Sama". [...] Sullivan's 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera, The Rose of Persia. Of the sextette [...] "I hear the soft note" [...] in Patience, Sullivan said to the singers, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> like this.

500|$|After the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892, New Zealand representative teams were selected for matches against international opponents. The first tour by a New Zealand representative side under NZRFU auspices was in 1894 to New South Wales (although an earlier team had toured Britain and Australia in 1888–1889). New Zealand's first Test match was in 1903 when they played Australia in Sydney. New Zealand's first home Test was played the following year when they defeated Britain at Athletic Park, Wellington, by 9–3. The win was significant as Britain had been unbeaten in their Australian tour, yet they won only two out of five matches in New Zealand. The captain of Great Britain, David Bedell-Sivright, said after the Test that he could not see New Zealand winning the big matches on their Northern Hemisphere tour, but [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> probably win most of the county matches." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wynter gave {{a lecture}} to the United Services Institute of Victoria {{entitled}} [...] "The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View", {{which was published}} in the April 1927 edition of British Army Quarterly. In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. [...] "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, [...] "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs but, frankly, we do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be able to do it.|$|E
500|$|Colin's father Stan was a {{foundation}} {{member of the}} Coogee Surf Life Saving Club and played rugby with the Randwick club in Sydney. Both Colin and his brother Keith inherited their father's love of rugby; Keith played as a flanker for Australia between 1936 and 1946, with his career interrupted by the Second World War. According to author Max Howell, Keith was a [...] "football genius", and was a star during the 1937 South African tour of Australia. It was after watching his brother play for Australia in 1937 that Colin decided he too wanted to play for Australia; at the time Colin was struggling in school rugby, and his father said to him [...] "Son, I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> ever play for Australia". Keith was on the ill-fated 1939 Wallaby tour to England; the team docked at Plymouth, {{but the next day}} war was declared and they returned to Australia without playing a game. Keith did manage to briefly resume his career after the war, touring to New Zealand with the 1946 Wallabies, but he was diagnosed with gout while on tour and was forced to retire.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley {{expanded}} his lectures for working men {{into a book}} titled Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, published in 1863. His intention was expressed {{in a letter to}} Charles Lyell which referred to the Monkeyana poem of 1861: [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> find room to complain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position touching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of the business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Ph. Egerton's line 'To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies', shall be unmistakable." [...] Darwin exclaimed, [...] "Hurrah the monkey book has come". A central part of the book provides a step by step explanation suitable for newcomers to anatomy of how the brains of apes and humans are fundamentally similar, with particular reference to both having a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The chapter concludes that this close similarity between apes and mankind proves that the original definition by Linnaeus of the biological Order of Primates was correct to include both, and mentions that an explanation of humans originating from apes is provided by Darwin's theory. The book also includes six pages of small print giving [...] "a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes" [...] describing how Owen had [...] "suppressed" [...] and denied what Huxley had now shown to be the truth regarding the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, describing this as reflecting on Owen's [...] "personal veracity". Reviewers regarded the book as a polemic against Owen, and a majority of them sided with Huxley.|$|E
