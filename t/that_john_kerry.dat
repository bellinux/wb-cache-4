Nader said <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> wanted to work to win Nader's support {{and the support of}} Nader's voters, prompting Nader to provide Kerry more than 20 pages of issues that he felt were important. According to Nader, he asked John Kerry to choose any three of the issues and highlight them in his campaign; should Kerry meet these conditions Nader would not contest the election. On February 22, 2004, having not heard back from Kerry, Nader announced that he would run for president as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{have responded}} to the influx of non-white {{immigrants}} by making more explicit efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000, despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide compared with the 2000 election. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in both 1992 and 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (59.7% of the vote) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the highest margin of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent Dick Mountjoy. In terms of voter registration, the Democratic Party has a plurality or majority of registrations only in the cities of Buena Park, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton.|$|E

5000|$|During the 2004 presidential campaign, Sherwood {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the anti-Kerry documentary Stolen Honor, which presented the viewpoints {{of a number of}} American Vietnam War veterans who contend <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry's</b> anti-war activities harmed them and depicted Kerry as a traitor. [...] Sherwood told Fox News [...] "We're all Vietnam combat vets, and we were all slandered and vilified by <b>John</b> <b>Kerry,</b> branded as baby killers."

The election analyst who makes predictions is far more interesting than one who doesn't. And if I collect egg on my face, then so be it." [...] An example of an incorrect prediction was one he made in The Australian of 1 November 2004. [...] Mackerras said <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> would defeat George W.

2500|$|On 10 January 2014, Israel {{approved}} {{plans for}} 1,400 settler homes. Saeb Erekat responded by saying [...] "The recent announcement shows Israel's clear {{commitment to the}} destruction of peace efforts and the imposition of an apartheid regime". Tzipi Livni, who also opposed new settler homes, was responded by Israeli politician Ze'ev Elkin, who suggested the settlements were vital for Israel's security: [...] "The path that Livni recommends means we will have to say goodbye to our security," [...] he said. On 14 January, Israel's defense minister Moshe Ya'alon rejected the negotiations and insulted John Kerry, saying he was acting based upon [...] "messianic feeling", and that [...] "The only thing that can 'save' us is <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> will get a Nobel Peace Prize and leave us alone." [...] Yuval Steinitz, another members of the Likud, expressed general agreement with Ya'alon's views, but disagreed with the personal insult. However, Yaalon later issued an official apology in a written statement sent to media from the Defense Ministry. On 18 January, Israel's finance minister Yair Lapid threatened to take his party, Yesh Atid, out of the coalition if peace talks did not advance. This would topple the current government and force either the formation of a new coalition, or early elections.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Miller {{appeared}} {{in an interview}} with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show Hardball. Here, Miller became visibly angry. Matthews criticized the premise of Miller's assertion that Kerry had actually voted against such defense programs by noting that in voting on appropriations bills, senators often vote against a version of a bill without wishing to oppose every item in that bill. Matthews also asked Miller to compare his assertion that a military under Kerry would be armed with only [...] "spitballs" [...] with rhetoric from Democrats that Republicans [...] "want to starve little kids, they {{want to get rid of}} education, they want to kill the old people" [...] and whether such level of rhetoric was constructive. When Miller expressed irritation at this line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, [...] "Do you believe now– do you believe, Senator, truthfully, <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> wants to defend the country with spitballs?" [...] Miller at first said that he wished the interview had been face-to-face so that he could [...] "get a little closer up into your face." [...] Miller angrily told Matthews to [...] "get out of my face," [...] and declared, [...] "I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, Matthews asked [...] "Let's be friends," [...] which Miller ignored. Miller later said about the interview, [...] "That was terrible. I embarrassed myself.

50|$|Republican {{consultant}} Ed Rollins and California Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte thought {{scenes from}} these marriages would help recruit Republican voters {{to the polls}} in the 2004 election.
