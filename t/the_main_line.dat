5|$|The London Underground {{station is}} on the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Edgware Road {{stations}} and is, along with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station, in Transport for London fare zone 1. Access is via escalators from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station concourse which houses the Underground station's ticket office. Until 2004, a wooden escalator led into the station, {{one of the last}} on the London Underground system that had not been replaced {{as a consequence of the}} King's Cross fire in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground {{station is}} sub-surface, {{situated}} immediately below <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station. It {{is served by}} the District and Circle lines.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} local railway {{was still}} of {{interest}} to the people of Anglesey. A public meeting was held in Llangefni on 5 July 1858, to popularise the idea of building a railway leaving <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> at Gaerwen, running north to Amlwch, west to Cemaes Bay, then south through Llanrhyddlad to rejoin <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> at Valley. This ambitious scheme did not gain enough support to proceed, although some landowners offered to exchange land for shares.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{changes have}} been made in the {{terminology}} making <b>the</b> number of <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> four. <b>The</b> northwestern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> is not considered a <b>main</b> <b>line</b> anymore and is renamed Värmlandsbanan. <b>The</b> southern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> between Nässjö and Falköping is also degraded since now what was <b>the</b> Eastern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> (Nässjö - Katrineholm) is considered a part of the southern one. The Norrland cross line is not a <b>main</b> <b>line</b> anymore, but a regional railway. Finally <b>the</b> northern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> south of Ockelbo refers to another and shorter way than that through Avesta. Sometimes the Ostkustbanan Stockholm-Sundsvall is now considererd a <b>main</b> <b>line,</b> since it has the majority of the passenger traffic into Norrland. Inlandsbanan was considered a <b>main</b> <b>line</b> for a few decades, but is now a tourist railway only. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> are still owned by the state, except Inlandsbanan which is owned by the counties.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Tōhoku and Yamagata shinkansen, JR East also provides service from Fukushima Station on <b>the</b> Tōhoku <b>Main</b> <b>Line</b> and Ōu <b>Main</b> <b>Line</b> routes. Fukushima Station is 272.8 km north of Tokyo via <b>the</b> Tōhoku <b>Main</b> <b>Line,</b> which then continues north to Morioka Station. <b>The</b> Ōu <b>Main</b> <b>Line</b> originates at Fukushima Station then runs 484.5 km north to Aomori Station, taking a more western route than <b>the</b> Tōhoku <b>Main</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station itself. With the entrance within <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over {{the point at which the}} line would connect to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line.</b> Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E

50|$|The Canterbury Provincial Railways built {{two lines}} into rural areas {{along the east}} coast, <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> South <b>Line</b> to Timaru and {{eventually}} Dunedin, and <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> North <b>Line</b> towards Marlborough. Both lines were built as broad gauge, as far as Rakaia on <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> South <b>Line,</b> reached in June 1873, and Amberley 50 km north of Christchurch, on <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> North <b>Line.</b>|$|R

5|$|Amman was an {{important}} city on the Ottoman lines of communication. All of the supplies and reinforcements for the Ottoman army force defending the line on {{the eastern edge of}} the Jordan Valley had passed through it. Now the city was on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> of retreat.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line.</b> The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line)</b> is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

5|$|The Underground station {{underwent}} major reconstruction at {{the same}} time as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours. However, with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> station's opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E
