40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{different}} perceptions and attributions of male and female victims who were sexually assaulted by an acquaintance or a stranger. 97 undergraduate students read a vignette that described a college male or female student attending a friend’s birthday party who is sexually assaulted in the bathroom by a man who is slightly acquainted or a stranger <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Subjects answered a survey about the vignette that measured: blame of <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> degree of trauma from the encounter, the need for psychological treatment, the amount of resistance <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> should have attempted, feelings of similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> and <b>the</b> perpetrator, and punishment for the rapist. For each perceived dependent variable in the vignette, a 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance was performed <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> effects of gender of the participant, gender of <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> and familiarity of <b>the</b> perpetrator <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> <b>The</b> data suggested very low blaming of <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> high levels of displeasure and trauma experienced, agreement that <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> would experience long term psychological effects and psychological treatment would be necessary. For the resistance factor, there was a strong <b>victim</b> gender effect: <b>the</b> male <b>victim</b> should have done more to defend himself against the perpetrator, but not <b>the</b> female <b>victim.</b> Participants felt little similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator, but perceived similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> was greater for females participants than for men. Participants felt more similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> of their own gender. Interestingly, women felt more similar to a victim assaulted by an acquaintance while men felt more similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> assaulted by a stranger. The data may suggest a possible reason that male victims of sexual abuse do not disclose to others because participants felt that <b>the</b> male <b>victim</b> should have been able to defend himself from the attack. Repeating the study at the same institution and other nearby non-residential campuses will further examine this concept...|$|R
