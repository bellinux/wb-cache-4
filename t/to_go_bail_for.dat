6000|$|... "Oh, very well. Stephen Strong is my name, and I {{may tell}} you that it is good {{at the bottom of a}} cheque for any {{reasonable}} amount. Well, I'm here <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> that young man. I know nothing of him except that I put him on his back in a ditch in an argument we had one night last winter in the reading-room yonder. I don't know whether he infected the lady or whether he didn't, but I do know, that like most of the poisoning calf-worshipping crowd who call themselves Vaccinators, this Bell is a liar, and that if he did, it wasn't his fault because it was God's will that she should die, and he'd a been wrong to try and interfere with Him. So name your sum and I'll stand the shot." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this juncture, it was {{announced}} that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather's rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for trial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. This generosity on the part of [...] "Old Charley" [...] was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar's worth of property upon the face of the earth.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 October 1934, Soberanis {{organised}} {{the first}} labour {{strike at the}} B.E.C. sawmill. It turned into a riot, and the police arrested 17 people. When he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> post <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> those arrested at the strike, he was himself arrested. The police refused to grant him bail and held him for 35 days, which weakened the LUA and caused many other LUA leaders to leave the group. He replaced them and continued his activism. In 1935 the Government passed several new laws, including one banning criticism. When he made a speech in Corozal Town in October 1935 calling the large merchant stores [...] "bloodsuckers" [...] and the Governor and the King [...] "crooks," [...] he was arrested again. He was charged with sedition, but was released after paying a BZ$25 fine.|$|R
5000|$|Peter, meanwhile, is also {{arrested after}} {{he shows up}} {{on the set of}} Fright Night and {{attempts}} to kill its new host, Regine, on live TV. Everyone thinks he's lost his sanity as he says, [...] "I have to kill the vampire"; and ends up in a state hospital. Alex is bailed out by Dr. Harrison and <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> post <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> Charley, only to find that he has already been bailed out by Regine. Alex and Dr. Harrison head to the state hospital when the doctor reveals that he is in fact a vampire. He tries to bite Alex only for her to turn the tables on him and run him through with a piece of wood. She then assumes his identity as a doctor. At the hospital, a commotion allows Alex and Peter to escape.|$|R
60|$|At {{the meeting}} we had {{there in the}} afternoon, Aristides {{reported}} our having been warned against our danger in the night by that murderer, and public record of the fact was made. The Altrurians consider any sort of punishment which is not expiation a far greater sin than the wrong it visits, and altogether barren and useless. After the record in this case had been made, the conference naturally turned upon what Aristides had seen of the treatment of criminals in America, and when, he told of our prisons, where people merely arrested and not yet openly accused are kept, I did not know which way to look, for you know I am still an American at heart, Dolly. Did you ever see the inside {{of one of our}} police-stations at night? Or smell it? I did, once, when I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> give <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> a wretched girl who had been my servant, and had gone wrong, but had been arrested for theft, and I assure you that the sight and the smell woke me in the night for a month afterwards, and I have never quite ceased to dream about it.|$|R
50|$|Tempers rose high in Norfolk at {{the time}} of Essex's Rebellion, and Townshend adhered {{strongly}} to the faction led by Sir Edward Coke and opposed to Essex. His feud with Sir Christopher Heydon, one of Essex's supporters, ended in 1600 with Heydon challenging Townshend to a duel, but before they could fight both men were summoned before the Privy Council, and were only released when Coke offered <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> Townshend's good behaviour.|$|E
6000|$|As I spoke {{there was}} a stir {{at the back of}} the crowded court, and an ungentle voice called out, [...] "I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> you, lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trelawney," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "I'll go with you; and I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> it, so will Jim, {{and be a}} credit to the undertaking. There's only one man I'm afraid of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! and I'll get Paul Blackthorn to help me,' {{said the}} boy. 'Come, Ellen, don't be so foolish; I tell you he's {{every bit as}} honest as I am, I'd <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are {{two ways}} of telling that story,' said Charley; 'but come, I don't want to quarrel with you about that now--you <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> me now, and you'll find your {{advantage}} in it. You know that well enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think!" [...] said Lord Roxton, {{holding the}} paper to the light. [...] "No, young fellah my lad, there is no use deceiving yourself. I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will," [...] the rancher assured him. [...] "If that man's alive to-morrow you'll {{get your}} money; I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> him. He's just {{the man you}} mention, but I'm {{considerably}} less sure about the crankiness than I was this morning. There's a quantity of fine clean sand in him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} write {{a line to}} the 'Squire, saying that you're ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail,</b> I do not {{think there will be}} any {{necessity}} of troubling you again to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very bad. He {{knows all}} about the murder;--I am {{convinced}} he does. He <b>went</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> the young man. He used to associate with him on most intimate terms. As to the sister;--there's no doubt about that. They live on the land {{of a person who}} owns a small estate in the parish." ...|$|R
50|$|Dwyer {{arrives and}} asks about Johnny. Brennan 'vouches' for him. Dwyer, {{not wanting to}} be {{anywhere}} near police, asks Bob <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> out one of his crew, offering a hundred dollars to Bob. Bob accepts the task.|$|R
6000|$|Every one, however, had {{not lost}} faith in him, {{and there was an}} old gentleman--whose name the ancient {{pamphlet}} very kindly conceals, calling him by the name of [...] "Compassion"--who <b>went</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> him, and he was released; whereupon he and his friends decamped. However, Rogers was again arrested, and this time he confessed the whole of his share in raising the ghosts of Morristown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes it's {{uncertain}} whether they're really gone or not,--seem gone, you know--body warm, joints limber--and so, although you think they're gone, you don't really know. I've had cases in my car. It's perfectly awful, becuz you don't know what minute they'll {{rise up and}} look at you!" [...] Then, after a pause, and slightly lifting his elbow toward the box,--"But he ain't in no trance! No, sir, I <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> him!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We won't go {{into the}} details of the case, because I am not a magistrate," [...] the deacon replied, with a majestic wave of the hand. [...] "Mr. Officer, tell the 'Squire that I am {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>to</b> any amount, and ask if the business can't be conducted here, for I'm too tired <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out of doors unless it is absolutely necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's a good girl, Sally. Abel couldn't {{have done}} better himself," [...] the Squire called after her, {{and then he turned}} to Dylks. [...] "Come along now, and get your hot pone. Jim Redfield won't hurt you; I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> him, and I'll see that nobody else gets at you. I've got a loft over this room where you'll be safe from {{everything}} but a pet coon that your Joey gave my little boy; and I reckon the coon won't bite you. I wouldn't, in his place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘O, fellow {{as much as}} you please!’ said he. ‘Fellow, {{with all}} my heart! That changes nothing. I am fellow, of course—obtrusive fellow, impudent fellow, if you like—but who are you? I hear of you with two names; I hear of you running away with young ladies, and getting cheered for a Frenchman, which seems odd; and one thing I will <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for,</b> that you were in a blue fright when the post-boy began to tell tales at my door. In short, sir, you may be a very good gentleman; but I don’t know enough about you, and I’ll trouble you for your papers, or <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before a magistrate. Take your choice; if I’m not fine enough, I hope the magistrates are.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{came back}} {{late in the}} afternoon, looking jaded and distraught. Hinkle, who looked neither, was with him. [...] "Well," [...] he began, [...] "this is the {{greatest}} thing in my experience. Belsky's not only alive and well, but Mr. Gregory and I are both at large. I did think, one time, that the police would take us into custody on account of our morbid interest in the thing, and I don't believe we should have got off, if the Consul hadn't <b>gone</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> us, so <b>to</b> speak. I thought we had better take the Consul in, on our way, and it was lucky we did." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, {{slapping}} tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, {{and by the time the}} two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have <b>gone</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> the innocence of Long John Silver.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sound of}} the young man's {{friendly}} voice recalled and steadied Cos's tipsy remembrance, and he saluted Arthur, {{as soon as he}} knew him, with a loud volley of friendly greetings. Pen was his dearest boy, his gallant young friend, his noble collagian, whom he had held in his inmost heart ever since they had parted--how was his fawther, no, his mother, and his guardian, the General, the Major? [...] "I preshoom, from your apparance, you've come into your prawpertee; and, bedad, yee'll spend it like a man of spirit--I'll <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> that. No? not yet come into your estete? If ye want any thrifle, heark ye, there's poor old Jack Costigan has got a guinea or two in his pocket--and, be heavens! you shall never want, Awthur, me dear boy. What'll ye have? John, come hither, and look aloive; give this gentleman a glass of punch, and I'll pay for't.--Your friend? I've seen him before. Permit me to have the honour of making meself known to ye, sir, and requesting ye'll take a glass of punch." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crown Prosecutor Michael Madden and Justice David Russel of the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador conditionally allow Turner <b>to</b> <b>go</b> free on <b>bail.</b> Doucet pays {{most of her}} CAD$75,000 bail.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{always was}} clever,' said poor Mrs Nickleby, {{brightening}} up, 'always, from a baby. I recollect {{when she was}} only two years and a half old, that a gentleman who used to visit very much at our house--Mr Watkins, you know, Kate, my dear, that your poor papa <b>went</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for,</b> who afterwards ran away to the United States, and sent us a pair of snow shoes, with such an affectionate letter that it made your poor dear father cry for a week. You remember the letter? In which {{he said that he was}} very sorry he couldn't repay the fifty pounds just then, because his capital was all out at interest, and he was very busy making his fortune, but that he didn't forget you were his god-daughter, and he should take it very unkind if we didn't buy you a silver coral and put it down to his old account? Dear me, yes, my dear, how stupid you are! and spoke so affectionately of the old port wine that he used to drink a bottle and a half of every time he came. You must remember, Kate?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, if you wish," [...] was the reply. And {{then the}} amount was fixed, and the prisoners {{sent out a}} messenger, {{to see if they}} could not get {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on their <b>bail</b> bonds.|$|R
50|$|Mike <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> Slam {{out from}} jail. He offers to help fix the Speedway, but Mike {{says she will}} sell the land to Roger Pearson; that way, {{they can afford to}} start a life together. Mike asks Slam for a favor.|$|R
50|$|As in real life, several addicts {{have walked}} out {{although}} almost all eventually accept treatment. As of 2012, only four addicts have completely refused: Alissa in Season 1, Marquel in Season 8, Adam in Season 9, and Larry in Season 11. A fifth person, Sean in Season 12, agreed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but <b>bailed</b> during the drive. In addition, Betsy in Season 2 accepted treatment, {{as long as}} her boyfriend could go too. During a layover in Chicago, the two decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home {{and try to get}} sober on their own. However, Betsy did <b>go</b> <b>to</b> treatment after her family held their defenses. A number of addicts who initially agreed have left treatment early due to rule violations, behavioral problems or a desire to not attend. Some addicts who leave early <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison or enter another facility to continue treatment; others never complete the rehab process, with the majority relapsing and continuing their former habits.|$|R
50|$|On December 1, 1955, Parks {{entered a}} Montgomery bus, {{refused to give}} up her seat for a white passenger, and was arrested. After being called about Parks' arrest, Nixon <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> her out of jail. He {{arranged}} for Parks' friend, Clifford Durr, a sympathetic white lawyer, to represent her. After years of working with Parks, Nixon was certain that she was the ideal candidate to challenge the discriminatory seating policy. Even so, Nixon had to persuade Parks to lead the fight. After consulting with her mother and husband, Parks accepted the challenge.|$|R
6000|$|Hereupon, with a pang {{of wonder}} and mercantile delight the dreamer awoke. His mercantile delight was not of long endurance; for it soon became plain that in this {{spirited}} tale there were unmarketable elements; which is just the reason why you have it here so briefly told. But his wonder has still kept growing; and I think the reader's will also, if he consider it ripely. For now he sees why I speak of the little people as of substantive inventors and performers. To the end they had kept their secret. I will <b>go</b> <b>bail</b> <b>for</b> the dreamer (having excellent grounds for valuing his candour) {{that he had no}} guess whatever at the motive of the woman--the hinge of the whole well-invented plot--until the instant of that highly dramatic declaration. It was not his tale; it was the little people's! And observe: not only was the secret kept, the story was told with really guileful craftsmanship. The conduct of both actors is (in the cant phrase) psychologically correct, and the emotion aptly graduated up to the surprising climax. I am awake now, and I know this trade; and yet I cannot better it. I am awake, and I live by this business; and yet I could not outdo--could not perhaps equal--that crafty artifice (as of some old, experienced carpenter of plays, some Dennery or Sardou) by which the same situation is twice presented and the two actors twice brought face to face over the evidence, only once it is in her hand, once in his--and these in their due order, the least dramatic first. The more I think of it, the more I am moved to press upon the world my question: Who are the Little People? They are near connections of the dreamer's, beyond doubt; they share in his financial worries and have an eye to the bank-book; they share plainly in his training; they have plainly learned like him to build the scheme of a considerate story and to arrange emotion in progressive order; only I think they have more talent; and one thing is beyond doubt, they can tell him a story piece by piece, like a serial, and keep him all the while in ignorance of where they aim. Who are they, then? and who is the dreamer? ...|$|R
