In order {{to evaluate the}} mechanical behaviour at different strain rates, OFHC copper was tested using two devices resulting in static and dynamic regimes. Moreover, the copper was subjected to two different processing methods, which made possible to study the influence of structure. The study of strain rate and microstructure was focused on progress in the mechanical properties after tensile tests. It {{was found that the}} strain rate is an important parameter affecting mechanical properties of copper. The ultimate tensile strength increased with the strain rate increasing and this effect was more visible at high strain rates (ε˙ 102 s− 1) (ε̇∼ 10 ^ 2 s^ - 1). However, the reduction of area had a different progress depending on microstructural features of materials (coarse-grained vs. ultrafine-grained structure) and introduced strain rate conditions during plastic deformation (static vs. dynamic regime). The wear behaviour of copper was investigated through pin-on-disk tests. The wear <b>tracks</b> <b>examination</b> showed that the delamination and the mild oxidational wears are the main wear mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Analysis and {{teaching}} of film sound and music has blossomed {{over the last}} decade, stemming largely from critics and theorists in the USA, Britain and France. 1 In Australia, too, these areas have expanded in fields of film and music studies with, most recently, a special issue of Sounds Australian journal devoted to screen composition. 2 However, there are still film-making arenas that are neglected in terms of in-depth analysis or critique of their sound and music. One such form is Australian non-fiction film. 3 An important reason for this deafness may be the problem with methodologies for sound <b>track</b> <b>examination.</b> There are no obvious models for documentary sound track 4 analysis, and models applied for fiction film music and sound do not automatically translate across to non-fiction.

40|$|Fatigue is {{a natural}} {{response}} to training and stress and as such it {{is an essential part}} of the human adaptive process. Despite the limited details of what constitutes fatigue, the negative impact of fatigue on a player’s ability to train and perform optimally and consistently, is evident to both player and coach. There is increased awareness that recovering from fatigue is essential for players at all levels. Recovery relates to the recognition of fatigue as it is expressed by the player, and then how this fatigue is managed in both training and performance contexts. The way that fatigue is expressed is determined by the type of training undertaken, the performance environment, and any lifestyle issues affecting the player. The selection of appropriate recovery strategies to address specific types of fatigue will depend on the recovery knowledge of player and coach, and on the availability and cost of the strategies selected. There are many recovery modalities available but few have been subjected to rigorous scientific <b>examination.</b> <b>Coaches</b> and players often depend on anecdotal information from fellow coaches and athletes for specific details on recovery techniques and their use. This chapter has two major aims. The first is to provide coaches and players with a systematic approach to monitoring adaptation to fatigue and stress. The second is to review current scientific information about commonly used recovery modalities and strategies with examples of how these can be integrated into training and performance for tennis...|$|R
50|$|In 1954, Mr. Dhonau {{continued}} to promote that mortuary education consisted {{of more than}} simply memorizing questions and their model answers. He said, “Since 1909, it has been our opinion, here at Cincinnati, that a mortuary college can be an educational institution rather than a state <b>examination</b> <b>coaching</b> facility; and we have never lost sight of that academic point.” To support his vision of competence and education in funeral service, Dhonau established a cooperative relationship with the University of Cincinnati for general studies and professional subjects. In 1966, Dhonau changed {{the name of the}} College to the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science. By fostering an atmosphere of support for research and publication, Dhonau also stimulated productivity in the faculty. Over the years, some 20 books were written by CCMS faculty, and several patents were produced at the College. Among the books was the series written by Dhonau and Dr. A. J. Nunnamaker on Anatomy for Embalmers, Hygiene and Sanitary Science, Manual of Case Analysis, Manual of Restorative Art, Personalities in Funeral Management, and Dissecting Guide for Embalmers. In 1940, Thomas Stueve, a Cincinnati attorney and member of the CCMS faculty, wrote Mortuary Law, which has become a standard in funeral service and in funeral service education. In 1985, Mr. James Dorn, CCMS faculty member and Chairman of Embalming Sciences, and Dr. Barbara Hopkins, Chairperson of the Xavier University Chemistry Department, co-authored and published Thanatochemistry, which is the standard chemistry textbook in funeral service education.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the principles of}} performing proper ultrasound examinations of the urinary tract. The following are discussed: preparation of patients, type of optimal apparatus, technique of examination and conditions which its description should fulfill. Urinary <b>track</b> <b>examination</b> in adults and in children constitutes {{an integral part of}} each abdominal examination. Such examinations should be performed with fasting patients or several hours after the last meal, with filled urinary bladder. Apparatus: Ultrasound examinations in children and infants are performed using transducers with the frequency of 5. 0 – 9. 0 MHz and in adults – with the frequency of 2. 0 – 6. 0 MHz. Doppler options are desirable since they improve diagnostic capacity of sonography in terms of differentiation between renal focal lesions. Scanning technique: Renal examinations are performed with the patients in the supine position. The right kidney is examined in the right hypochondriac region using the liver as the ultrasound “window. ” The left kidney is examined in the left hypochondriac region, preferably in the posterior axillary line. Ultrasound examinations of the upper segment of the ureters are performed after renal examination when the pelvicalyceal system is dilated. A condition necessary for a proper examination of the perivesical portion of the ureter is full urinary bladder. The scans of the urinary bladder are performed in transverse, longitudinal and oblique planes when the bladder is filled. Description of the examination: The description should include patient’s personal details, details of the referring unit, of the unit in which the examination is performed, examining physician’s details, type of ultrasound apparatus and transducers as well as the description proper...|$|R
40|$|Published data {{suggests}} that wedge resection for stage I {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is associated with}} improved overall survival compared to stereotactic body radiation therapy. We report CyberKnife outcomes for high-risk surgical patients with biopsy-proven stage I NSCLC. PET/CT imaging was completed for staging. Three-to-five gold fiducial markers were implanted in or near tumors to serve as targeting references. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured using lung windows; the margins were expanded by 5 [*]mm to establish the planning treatment volume (PTV). Treatment plans were designed using a mean of 156 pencil beams. Doses delivered to the PTV ranged from 42 to 60 [*]Gy in three fractions. The 30 [*]Gy isodose contour extended at least 1 [*]cm from the GTV to eradicate microscopic disease. Treatments were delivered using the CyberKnife system with tumor <b>tracking.</b> <b>Examination</b> and PET/CT imaging occurred at 3 [*]month follow-up intervals. Forty patients (median age 76) with a median maximum tumor diameter of 2. 6 [*]cm (range, 1. 4 – 5. 0 [*]cm) and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 [*]s (FEV 1) of 57 % (range, 21 – 111 %) were treated. A median dose of 48 [*]Gy was delivered to the PTV over 3 – 13 [*]days (median, 7 [*]days). The 30 [*]Gy isodose contour extended a mean 1. 9 [*]cm from the GTV. At a median 44 [*]months (range, 12 – 72 [*]months) follow-up, the 3 [*]year Kaplan–Meier locoregional control and overall survival estimates compare favorably with contemporary wedge resection outcomes at 91 and 75 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenic}} {{mechanism for}} the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation syndrome has not yet been fully elucidated. We sought {{to assess the impact of}} pre-excitation on LV systolic function and whether the use of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and speckle tracking is more helpful in detection of the LV dyssynchrony than conventional echo parameters in these patients. Methods: This observational case control study was carried out on adults with manifest pre-excitation syndromes. A detailed echocardiographic assessment was performed including TDI and speckle <b>tracking</b> <b>examination.</b> Results: Our study patients were divided into two groups, group 1 : with lateral accessory pathways (AP) (23 patients aged 31. 65  ±  6. 5  years), group 2 : with septal AP (25 patients, 34. 84  ±  10. 8  years). Echocardiography showed a lower ejection fraction (EF) in group 2 than in group 1 (0. 60  ±  0. 07 % in group 1 vs. 0. 50  ±  0. 08 % in group 2, p =  0. 000). The radial strain dyssynchrony index was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (58. 78  ±  33. 47 vs. 139. 52  ±  21. 14  ms; p <  0. 0001) with a significant negative correlation with EF (r = − 0. 8, p =  0. 000). Dyssynchrony detection was higher using speckle tracking technique than M mode/Doppler methods (p =  0. 006). Conclusion: Patients with pre-excitation syndrome may have depressed LV function unrelated to tachyarrhythmia, especially if the AP has a septal location. This dysfunction may be associated with the LV dyssynchronus contraction caused by pre-excitation. The use of TDI and speckle tracking echocardiographic techniques may be associated with an increase in the identification of manifest pre-excitation patients with significant LV dyssynchrony...|$|R
