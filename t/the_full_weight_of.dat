Now that the Army was {{convinced of the}} value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it.

He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} leading the Australian advance along with a troop from the 1st Tank Battalion and engineers from the 2/7th Field Company. Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November, they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a secondary task of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of {{the remnants of the}} 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for tracked vehicles to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> their firepower.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E

Thus, the ECT is prolonged in a specific and linear fashion with increasing concentrations of hirudin.
