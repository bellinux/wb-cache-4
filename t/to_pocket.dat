5|$|Age of Empires (AoE) is a history-based {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Ensemble Studios {{and published by}} Microsoft, and the first game in the Age of Empires series. The game uses the Genie, a 2D sprite-based game engine. The game allows the user to act {{as the leader of}} an ancient civilization by advancing it through four ages (the Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron Ages), gaining access to new and improved units with each advance. It was later ported <b>to</b> <b>Pocket</b> PCs with Windows, resulting in a version very similar to the PC game.|$|E
5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above par value, but the government only received par for them, leaving the company <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> the difference.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, the first player <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but {{is not out of}} the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|Kender are {{described}} as not believing that there is anything morally wrong with handling others' items, although the habit may land them in considerable trouble with the owner of an object. In addition, they do not tend <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> things like money, gems, and the like, as they are depicted as having little concept of monetary value. Kender oppose actual thieving vehemently, and consider being called a thief a great insult to their dignity.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Chinese {{are known}} to have made sacrifices of young men and women to river deities (Hebo), and to have buried slaves alive with their owners upon death as part of a funeral service. This was {{especially}} prevalent during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao of Wei demonstrated to the villagers that sacrifice to river deities was actually a ploy by crooked priests <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> money. In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out the absurdity of human sacrifice.|$|E

The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (Keep Our PACT) Act, which would fully fund No Child Left Behind and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. He introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in student loans that had allowed lenders <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.|$|E
25|$|In theory, Kenyan law {{applies to}} Kakuma camp. In practice, this seldom happens.

Refugees have been allowed to establish their own 'court' system which is funded by LWF. Community leaders preside over these courts and are allowed <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> the fines they impose. Apart from fines there are punishments, including flogging and detention. Dinka community members (from South Sudan) tend to get stronger punishments. Refugees are left without legal remedies against abuses as they can’t appeal against their own courts.|$|E

25|$|The Signals Intelligence Office {{was able}} to {{intercept}} Soviet messages and inform Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo of the enemy's movements during the Battle of Suomussalmi. With the intelligence, Colonel Siilasvuo had the initiative and was able <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> and destroy the Soviet 44th Rifle Division at Raate road; the division had been en route to support the already encircled 163rd Rifle Division. For example, the Finns intercepted messages guiding the encircled Soviet troops how to light up signal fires for night-time air supply pilots to recognize. Subsequently, the Finns lighted similar fires {{and some of the}} Soviet supplies landed on Finn-held ground. The decisive victory by the Finnish Army against superior enemy forces is cited {{as one of the most}} significant battles of the Winter War.|$|E
25|$|Có was {{generally}} regarded as being corrupt. As a general, he had a base pay of US$177 monthly, {{but he managed to}} purchase three villas in Saigon and owned property estimated at US$600,000 near Tan Son Nhut Air Base on the capital's outskirts. His wealth was believed to have come from bribes from subordinate officers who wanted postings away from danger, usually desk jobs, as well as charging up to USD3,400 a head for draft evaders, depending on how rich they were. Có was also accused of using his position as defense minister <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> the rent collected from the American military for building U.S. bases on land rented from the Saigon government. His wife was known to be a gambling addict during his halcyon days and was reputed to have once lost USD8,500 in one outing.|$|E
25|$|Packard soon {{developed}} this basic premise into a manuscript titled The Adventures of You on Sugar Cane Island. He {{set out in}} 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, {{he was able to}} convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed <b>to</b> <b>Pocket</b> Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able to make a contract for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to write books for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors.|$|E

25|$|Davis won the World Billiards Championships in June 1980, beating Rex Williams 5978-4452, and in {{so doing}} became the only player except for Joe Davis to have lifted both the World Snooker and World Billiards titles. However, he was {{quick to point out that}} {{standards}} differed markedly from those of the 1930s when the top players made such large breaks that they killed the game as popular entertainment. He would receive £1500 plus a cheque for £500 for the highest break (583); this was presented to him by 94-year-old Willie Smith, World Billiards champion in 1920 and 1923. Davis also retained the title later in November the same year, when the championship was restored to a knock-out basis for the first time since 1934. Davis beat Paddy Morgan 1907-978, John Barrie 1253-1153 and Mark Wildman 3037-2064 in the final <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> £4000, then a record for a billiards event.|$|E
25|$|Large {{public service}} rate increases, added to weak {{regulatory}} frameworks and constant renegotiation of concession contracts, brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% {{of which were}} earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose {{in line with the}} U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of earnings for the newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies <b>to</b> <b>pocket</b> US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or to make all the investments stipulated by the contracts. The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced by associated firms, contracting heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Sackett {{discovered}} a partly-completed manuscript while she researched documents for her book Inside Trek. This prompted her to suggest sending it <b>to</b> <b>Pocket</b> Books, which held {{the rights to}} Star Trek novels at the time, despite the prior agreement with Bantam. Roddenberry was not enthusiastic about the idea, but editor David Stern at Pocket Books was interested {{and wanted to know}} whether Sackett and fellow writer Fred Bronson would be able to expand and complete it. Contract negotiations for the work began in April 1991, during which time Sackett had a version re-typed because no electronic versions were available and the type on the existing print out was faint in places. The writers were dealing with Roddenberry's lawyer Leonard Maizlish, but discussions lasted over six months. Two days after Roddenberry's death on October 24, they were informed that work on the novel would not continue. Sackett said this may have been linked to her dismissal from the [...] television series following Roddenberry's death. Pocket Books brought in Michael Jan Friedman to finish the work, but it was never published.|$|E
