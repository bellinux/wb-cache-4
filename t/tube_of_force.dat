5000|$|Maxwell changed Faraday's phrase {{lines of}} force to tubes of force, when expressing his fluidic {{assumptions}} involved in his mathematization of Faraday's theories. [...] A <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> also called a tube of electrostatic induction or field tube, are the lines of electric force which moves so that its beginning traces a closed curve on a positive surface, its end will trace a corresponding closed curve on the negative surface, and the line of force itself will generate an inductive tubular surface. Such a tube is called a [...] "Solenoid". There is a pressure {{at right angles to}} a <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> of one half the product of the dielectric and magnetic density. If through the growth of a field the tubes of force are spread sideways or in width there is a magnetic reaction to that growth in intensity of electric current. However, if a <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is caused to move endwise {{there is little or no}} drag to limit velocity. Tubes of force are absorbed by bodies imparting momentum and gravitational mass. Tubes of force are a group of electric {{lines of force}}.|$|E

A consistent asymptotic expansion is obtained assuming that the electron Larmor radius is small compared to the radius of the probe. The order of magnitude of neglected terms is given. It is found that the electric potential within the <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> defined by the cross section of the probe decays non-mono tonic ally from the probe; this bump disappears at a certain probe voltage and the theory is valid up to this voltage. The transition region, which extends beyond plasma potential, is not exponential. The possible saturation of the electron current is discussed. Restricted numerical results are given; they seem to be useful for weaker magnetic fields down to the zero-field limit. Extensions of the theory a r e considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to study dynamic {{behavior}} of the ionosphere-protonosphere coupling within the plasmasphere is developed and used to calculate ion distributions above 500 km using observed electron densities at 500 km. The method {{is based on the}} relation between the total magnetic flux tube content of H(+) above some reference height (e. g., 3000 km) and the H(+) flux at that height, which is uniquely determined by the coupled momentum and continuity equations for the quasi-steady state. The O(+) profile is perturbed from diffusive equilibrium only by ion drag with H(+). The time dependency is taken into account by applying self-consistent boundary conditions which are obtained from the solution of the time-dependent equation for the tube content of H(+). Calculations are carried out for two models. The first model deals with the ion dynamics in a <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> which rotates with the earth. In the second model, effects of the cross-L plasma drifts are considered. Both models produce diurnal variations of H(+) and O(+) densities near 1000 km similar to observational results...|$|E

40|$|Along a <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> of the {{geomagnetic}} field, {{charged particles}} such as electrons, electric field and hydromagnetic waves propagate simultaneously from the equatorial {{region in the}} magnetosphere to the mutually conjugate areas of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The auroral electrojets, SSC 2 ̆ 7 s, SI 2 ̆ 7 s and pc- 5 pulsations show remarkable simultaneity and similarity between the conjugate areas. Their time-dependent parameters such as the form of frequency spectra, the dominant period of pulsations, the rise-time of SSC 2 ̆ 7 s, etc., are {{almost exactly the same}} in the conjugate stations. However, the correlation between amplitudes or magnitudes of these phenomena at the conjugate points is considerably smaller than that for the time-dependent parameters. The horizontal polarizations of SSC 2 ̆ 7 s, SI 2 ̆ 7 s and pulsations are the left-hand mode in the morning and right-hand one in the afternoon with an absolutely high statistical significance.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{variation}} in hard (E greater than 10 keV) X-radiation, H-alpha and microwave emission during the impulsive phase of solar flares. Analysis shows that the rise-time in the 20 - 30 -keV X-ray spike depends on the electron hardness. The impulsive phase is also marked by an abrupt, very intense increase in H-alpha emission in one or more knots of the flare. Properties of these H-alpha kernels include: (1) a luminosity several times greater than the surrounding flare, (2) an intensity rise starting about 20 - 30 sec before, peaking about 20 - 25 sec after, and lasting about twice as long as the hard spike, (3) a location lower in the chromosphere than the remaining flare, (4) essentially no expansion prior to the hard spike, and (5) a position within 6000 km of the boundary separating polarities, usually forming {{on both sides of the}} neutral line near both feet of the same <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Correspondingly, impulsive microwave events are characterized by: (1) great similarity in burst structure with 20 - 32 keV X-rays but only above 5000 MHz, (2) typical low frequency burst cutoff between 1400 - 3800 MHz, and (3) maximum emission above 7500 MHz...|$|E

40|$|The {{equivalent}} circuit method of Stening (1968) {{is used to}} calculate current distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} equatorial electrojet. Both height and latitude profiles are obtained which show reasonable agreement with observations. The <b>tube</b> <b>of</b> magnetic <b>force</b> model employed in the calculations is useful in understanding some of the variations in the electrojet. Changes in height of the electron density profile are shown to lead to changes in the maximum current density of the electrojet. Two further problems are discussed: (1) the double peak structure in the current density height profile and (2) the relationship between the instabilities observed by VHF backscatter and ground-based magnetic measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} {{theory of}} magnetism, introduced by Faraday, is now looked upon by all physicists as correct. The older theory which assumes {{the existence of}} magnetic fluids covering {{the ends of the}} magnet is in some cases mathematically simpler, and is for this reason often made use of. This, however, is apt to breed confusion as to {{the true nature of the}} induction or polarization in any given case. The difficulty Tyndall experienced in accepting Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s views as to diamagnetism, is accounted for by the fact that he was thinking in terms of the fluid theory, while Faraday was considering the magnetic polarization in the diamagnetic substance. The object of this paper is to insist again upon the distinction between these two theories, and at the same time to consider some points in the induction theory itself. A number of diagrams will be described which illustrate the different aspects of the induction theory. They show how the molecules of the magnet are supposed to be polarized, and how this polarization is continued in the surrounding ether. The <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> or 2 ̆ 2 polarization tubes, 2 ̆ 2 and the equipotential surfaces are drawn in each case according to Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s method.

40|$|We present {{observations}} from the Polar satellite that confirm {{the existence of}} two types of depletion layers predicted under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions in magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The first depletion type occurs along the stagnation line when IMF BX and/or dipole tilt are/is present. Magnetic merging occurred away from the equator (Maynard et al., 2003) and flux pile-ups developed while the field lines drape to the high-latitude merging sites. This high-shear type of depletion {{is consistent with the}} depletion layer model suggested by Zwan and Wolf&nbsp;(1976) for low-shear northward IMF conditions. Expected sites for depletion layers are associated with places where IMF <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> first impinge upon the magnetopause. The second depletion type develops poleward of the cusp. Under strongly driven conditions, magnetic fields from Region&nbsp; 1 current closure over the lobes (Siscoe et al., 2002 c) cause the high-latitude magnetopause to bulge outward, creating a shoulder above the cusp. These shoulders present the initial obstacle with which the IMF interacts. Flow is impeded, causing local flux pile-ups and low-shear depletion layers to form poleward of the cusps. Merging at the high-shear dayside magnetopause is consequently delayed. In both low- and high-shear cases, we show that the depletion layer structure is part of a slow mode wave {{standing in front of the}} magnetopause. As suggested by Southwood and Kivelson&nbsp;(1995), the depletions are rarefactions on the magnetopause side of slow-mode density compressions. While highly sheared magnetic fields are often used as proxies for ongoing local magnetic merging, depletion layers are prohibited at merging locations. Therefore, the existence of a depletion layer is evidence that the location of merging must be remote relative to the observation...|$|R

5000|$|In {{water tube}} boilers, {{the way the}} water is {{recirculated}} inside the boiler before becoming steam {{can be described as}} either natural circulation or forced circulation. In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam. What makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in. In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam to the top <b>of</b> the furnace <b>tubes.</b> In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the forced circulation boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> a <b>forced</b> circulation boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler ...|$|R
