5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other mints {{during the years}} the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles.|$|E

5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other gates, so that Khalid {{would be}} unable to move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong {{katabatic}} winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of trematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these trematodes include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. Trematodes were generally more common at the Cedar Key saltwater marsh <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|E

5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were a little better <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared {{some of the money}} with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found.

Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area rather <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of}} the cabin as had been previously thought.

The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base.|$|E

5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E

This location was counter to previous suggestions: a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that the memorial should be built on Montefiore Hill, while in 1923 the plans for the memorial involved erecting it at the rear of Government House, rather <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front.|$|E
