40|$|Freedom of <b>the</b> will <b>is</b> {{a never-ending}} source of puzzlement for {{academic}} philosophers. At the same time, {{it is something}} deeply familiar to everyone. For the relevant concept of freedom underlies much, if not all, of our ordinary discourse and thinking about ourselves and others. However, our attempt {{to make sense of}} the world, through science and philosophy, can itself cast doubt on the validity of this conception of freedom. Are we not ourselves part of the world whose workings we study? And are we not, then, subject to the same laws of nature that we have discovered to govern that world? If so, should we not admit that our actions are simply physical events, mere links in a long chain of cause and effect? So, should we not conclude that the special perspective we take on our own actions and <b>those</b> of others <b>is</b> perfectly illusory? For a long time, this worry was phrased almost solely in terms of the problem of universal determinism. But in more recent times, many philosophers have recognized that the question whether we can somehow reconcile the familiar conception of agency with determinism may be a red herring. Free will, they argue, may be illusory even if our actions are undetermined. For if indeterminism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> absence of determination, what is it but pure randomness of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> that does indeed exist at the subatomic level? If that <b>is</b> true, <b>the</b> ideaea that there is a special class of happenings which find their origin in human choice seems to be at least as problematic as it would be under determinism: what we regard as our choices would be nothing but random events, over which we have as little control as over the outcome of a die roll. What we end up doing would be merely accidental, and precisely not up to ourselves. My aim in this thesis will be to show how to overcome this dichotomy between accidentality and causal necessitation. A sound account of agency, I will argue, has to take seriously the idea that in practical deliberation, we are genuinely self-determining. I will show that progress towards such an account has <b>been</b> hampered by <b>the</b> prevalence of a reductive understanding of intentional action, according to which the explanation of an action in terms of an agent's reasons is just a species of the `ordinary' form of quasi-mechanical causation we associate with the laws of nature. On that assumption, non-accidentality can consist only in something's being caused by prior states and events. Instead, I defend a less dogmatic view, on which we can distinguish a number of formally distinct kinds of causal principles, or forms of non-accidentality. One of <b>those</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of responsiveness to reasons, or spontaneity, that is exhibited by intentional action. In exercising such spontaneity, I will argue, we are truly self-determining and free...|$|R
40|$|Exploit your {{comparative}} advantages Cue: When choosing which crop to grow, {{there are}} two major factors that farmers must consider. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> their agro-ecological situation, in other words, the character of the land they farm and the climate they live in. Temperature, rainfall, gradient of land and soil type will all have an influence on crop choice. The second factor involves the opportunities that the farmer will have to sell the crop. For example, if the farmer lives in a remote area far from any markets, {{it will be difficult to}} make a good profit from growing and selling a bulky, low value crop like maize, since the costs of transporting it to market will be so high. A low volume but high value crop like cashew nuts might be a better alternative. With the liberalisation of trade in Africa, the importance of farmers selecting the right crop for their situation has never been higher. Competition from foreign exports means that farmers have to exploit any comparative advantage they have in terms of what crops they can grow and which markets they can access. In Zambia, the National Farmers Union (<b>the</b> ZNFU), <b>is</b> helping farmers to cope with the pressures they have experienced since the liberalisation of the economy ten years ago. Alfred Mwila, an economist at the ZNFU spoke to Chris Kakunta about the problems and solutions for small-scale farmers. IN:		?<b>The</b> farmers have <b>been</b> ?? OUT:		??among our small-scale farmers. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alfred Mwila of the Zambia National Farmers Union encouraging farmers to exploit their comparative advantages in order to boost their profits. Transcript Mwila	<b>The</b> farmers have <b>been</b> facing <b>the</b> major problem of low producer prices, and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of enterprises that they are engaged in are not giving them the profits that will enable them to reinvest in agriculture. So essentially they are engaging in enterprises that are giving them a loss, and this is a big problem. For them to generate a profit they need to sell, they need to be guaranteed of a market, and they need to produce in the most cost effective way, and for this they need some facilitation. Kakunta	So as Zambia National Farmers Union, what are you doing in order to help these farmers come out of these negative impacts that have been created as a result of liberalised policies. Mwila	One of the things that we engage in <b>is</b> <b>the</b> provision of information to our members, to enable them make timely and economic decisions. We are able to advise our members that the appropriate crops for these areas are ABCD, what is an economic price for which they should sell their farm outputs. Kakunta	What about the farmers, what should they do themselves in order for them to benefit? Mwila	Our farmers need to embrace issues related to quality. They should be able to produce efficiently, package their produce, and be able to land their produce in their neighbouring countries or beyond, at a cost where they will make a profit. So they have a challenge as well, to position themselves strategically. They should stop growing or engaging in enterprises that are totally unprofitable. Our farmers need to produce, or engage in an enterprise that has comparative advantage. Before liberalisation, there was a deliberate policy to promote maize production, and maize as a result, was even promoted in areas where it is not agro-ecologically suitable, or indeed competitive, because of the distance from the market. So we need to reorient our farmers towards thinking of engaging in enterprises where they know that they are agro-ecologically suitable, and they are profitable. One province for example will be specialising in maize, because they <b>are</b> close to <b>the</b> market. Maize <b>is</b> a bulky product, so they will be able to take advantage of the closeness of the market, and they will be able to make a profit, because they will have less transport costs. Where it is impossible to grow maize, say Western Province, certainly we may just encourage them to grow maize at subsistence level, and not to look at maize as a cash crop. And they should be encouraged to grow what other provinces are not growing right now. And they would certainly have certain comparative advantages in, say, cashew nuts, because of the conditions there. It is certainly most ideal, and we should promote such enterprises. So <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of issues that we feel should be addressed that have been a consequence of liberalisation. Ideally the small-scale sector to us is a very critical sector. It has been growing in number, but unfortunately not contributing to the economy in real terms. So that is a worry, and I think we need address something for this huge potential that exists among our small-scale farmers. End of track. An economist from Zambia?s National Farmers Union suggests that farmers need to be very careful in choosing which crops to grow, so that these match the capabilities of their land and climate, and the type of markets which they can access...|$|R
40|$|<b>Being</b> {{heard on}} <b>the</b> world stage Cue: If {{international}} trade {{is like a}} boxing match, the World Trade Organisation, or WTO, would have to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> referee - keeping the fight clean and ensuring <b>the</b> rules <b>are</b> followed. And while many developing countries may often feel like a tiny David facing the developed world?s Goliath, WTO trade talks do give {{them the opportunity to}} make and influence trade agreements. Government delegations from around the world come to the WTO to fight their corner, {{and in the case of}} African countries, they are able to fight as a team, called the ?African Group?. Making sure that the voices of ordinary farmers are heard at such negotiations is a job that has been taken up by a number of NGOs. One of them is Action Aid, an organisation that offers both practical support to farmers, as well as lobbying for their interests. Mweni Kiio <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Food Rights Campaign co-ordinator at Action Aid Kenya. In our next report she tells Eric Kadenge about <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of support her organisation is giving to Kenya?s farmers, and her passionate belief that farmers need to make their voices heard. IN:		?We have a two-pronged approach ? OUT:		?both nationally and internationally. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mweni Kiio of Action Aid Kenya, on the need for farmers? voices to be heard by policy makers. Transcript Kiio	We have a two-pronged approach. Our regional offices, that are working with farmers to provide for them some of the services that the government used to provide, like better seeds, or even working with the government to provide extension services. And also providing some kind of credit, in that we support their farmer groups so that they can be able to assist the farmer, to keep him in business. Then we also have the second bit which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> policy aspect, where we lobby for better policies. Like we have been challenging some of these policies under <b>the</b> WTO. That <b>is,</b> there is a certain agreement called ?Agreement on Agriculture? which we believe, if Kenya is to adopt everything that is in that agreement as it stands, then our farmers stand to lose more than to gain. So we are making some proposals within that agreement, that we hope will benefit the farmers by the end of the day. Because within that agreement there is a certain provision which says that a country should withdraw subsidies or domestic support to its farmers. Kenya has done that, but that <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> same case with developed countries, because developed countries are still carrying on with increasing their domestic support to their farmers. The most recent case <b>is</b> <b>the</b> US government, which just increased its support to its farmers. And by the end of the day, you find that farmers from developed countries are able to produce more cheaply than farmers from developing countries, and then they are able now to sell their products in the international markets, and products from developing countries cannot compete. Kadenge	And at the moment what progress have you been able to make in this lobbying? Kiio	We have been working very closely with the Ministry of Trade, where we have shared our concerns. And the government delegation that actually represents Kenya in the negotiations in this ?Agreement on Agriculture?, they have taken in our views, and it?s part of their position, the Kenyan government position to the negotiations. And the beauty of it is that Kenya is not negotiating alone; it?s part of what they call the ?African group?. So in the negotiations under WTO, whatever concerns we have raised have been tabled through that group. And the greatest achievement, I think, is a proposal on what we call the ?development box?. Under the ?Agreement on Agriculture?, there are various boxes that are given, where governments are allowed to support their farmers. And what we did is look at all those boxes, and saw that there are some issues that are just relevant to developing countries, that have not been addressed in their available boxes; there are three of them. Now we are proposing a ?development box?, where we are saying, developing countries need to be allowed to support rural development initiatives and food security issues in their countries, because <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of things that we are facing. And these are not issues that are of concern really to the developed countries, but we think they are of major concern to us. Kadenge	Now where would you like to see the small-scale farmer in future, as we try to battle this whole issue that is affecting them? Kiio	I would like to see the farmer in the forefront, advocating for his issues. I would like to see a farmer who <b>is</b> engaging <b>the</b> government actively, both at the local level, national level and international level, and instead of I speaking for the farmers, like it has <b>been</b> in <b>the</b> past, I would like to see the farmer doing it for himself, and being engaged in every decision-making process that affects him, by the end of the day. I would also like to see a strong farmer movement in this country, because I strongly believe by the end of the day that even now we are not listening to our farmers; they contribute very much to the economy - you know that agriculture <b>is</b> <b>the</b> backbone of this country - and it is only right to involve such important people in decision-making, because they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only ones who really know <b>the</b> problems they <b>are</b> facing. And they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only ones who can come up with the right solutions to solve their own problems. And decisions should not be made for them, both nationally and internationally.

40|$|Domesticating {{wild fruit}} trees Cue: In Cameroon, {{as in other}} parts of Africa, people derive many {{benefits}} from wild, or indigenous, tree species. They are an important source of food and medicines for farming families, and can also be a source of income. However many forest fruit trees are being lost through deforestation and farmers are having to walk farther and farther from their homes to harvest them. One solution to this problem is for farmers to plant wild fruit species near their homes, a process called domestication. Ann Degrande, who works for ICRAF, the World Agroforestry Centre, in Cameroon, has been part of a programme to support fruit tree domestication. She spoke to Martha Chindong about the benefits indigenous fruit trees can offer, both to farmers and to the environment, and about the challenges facing farmers who want to earn income from their fruit. Martha began by asking whether <b>the</b> programme itself <b>was</b> supplying farmers with tree seedlings to plant. IN:		?<b>The</b> technology we <b>are</b> developing now is tree domestication. ? OUT:		?. will get him a more diverse package of income. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ann Degrande of the World Agroforestry Centre on how planting indigenous fruit trees benefits both farmers and the environment. Transcript Degrande	<b>The</b> technology we <b>are</b> developing now is tree domestication and we want people to select their own trees. So the best trees they can find in their environment. We teach them how to multiply, how to propagate those best trees that they can find in their environment. However, sometimes farmers in a particular village are asking for new species, for new trees that they can?t find in their environment. And then we try to link them up with other communities, with other farmers in other areas that have those trees on their farms. And we try to develop a kind of exchange of seeds or vegetative material. Chindong	What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> environmental aspects of it, are they really achieving anything? Degrande	That is a very interesting question, and the great advantage of agroforestry is that it can combine poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Because we are talking here of planting more trees to help farmers to get more income but by planting <b>those</b> trees we <b>are</b> also protecting <b>the</b> environment. Chindong	You talked of fruit trees or domestication. I wanted to find out whether these trees they plant only help for environmental protection or they have other benefits from the trees? Degrande	Trees usually have a lot of benefits. Trees can give fruits that can <b>be</b> sold on <b>the</b> market that can give income. The same fruits can also be eaten, consumed by the household and that has advantages for everybody in the household to have a more balanced diet, to have more vitamins, to have more minerals in their diet. The other benefit that trees have is that they can provide firewood, they can give shade, they can also protect against wind. Trees have many benefits and that?s the good thing about trees. Chindong	Ann, if I can get you well, it means that as of now you don?t have any problem with farmers accepting the new techniques of agroforestry, your problem is only to extend the technique? Degrande	No, that would be too much said. There are always problems when you introduce a new technology. First of all there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> problem of sensitising people. People need to be sensitised and informed about the new technique and the benefits of trees and the benefits of tree domestication. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first thing. <b>The</b> second thing <b>is</b> adopting new techniques and especially vegetative propagation needs some initial investment. You need for instance to set up a nursery, that requires some financial means, that sometimes individual farmers cannot have. Sometimes farmers group themselves and try to generate the necessary means to set up a nursery. But sometimes they need some help, they need financial support, maybe in the form of credit from NGO?s or the government. And then another thing <b>is</b> about <b>the</b> marketing, the commercialisation of the tree products. In Cameroon a lot of tree products are consumed widely, they <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> markets. But {{there are a lot of}} problems for farmers to get to <b>those</b> markets. There <b>is</b> for instance bad infrastructure, <b>the</b> roads <b>are</b> not good and that means that a lot of this fruit especially the perishable fruit remain in the village and cannot generate income for farmers although they <b>are</b> demanded in <b>the</b> market. So there is a whole issue of infrastructure and even support to farmer groups to commercialise their tree products. And that needs some attention I think from support organisations and even from government. Chindong	Considering the villages that you work with can you picture your farmers with hectares of agroforestry gardens? Degrande	I think it?s a progressive thing. What we first try to promote is that at least every farmer has some fruit trees or some beneficial trees on his farm or her farm. So we don?t exclude that some of the more enterprising farmers, they can go for hectares and hectares of fruit trees. There will be some farmers who will do that but the majority of farmers they will integrate trees in their cocoa farms, they will plant more trees on the boundaries of their farm, they will plant better trees in their home garden and that?s how they will get more out of these trees. Another thing is that we are also developing approaches to help to assist farmer groups to market their products as a group so that they get more bargaining power. So <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of things we are looking at and we want to make small changes but that will mean something to the farmer that will get him a more diverse package of income.
