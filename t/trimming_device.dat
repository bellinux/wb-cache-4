40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} the Yacht Research Unit's Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel (University of Auckland) to test the effect of dynamic trimming on three IMOCA 60 inspired main-sail models in an upwind (β AW = 60 °) unheeled configuration. This study presents dynamic fluid structure interaction results in well controlled conditions (wind, sheet length) with a dynamic trimming system. Trimming oscillations are done around an optimum value of CF obj previously found with a static trim. Different oscillation amplitudes and frequencies of trimming are investigated. Measurements are done with a 6 component force balance and a load sensor giving access to the unsteady mainsail sheet load. The driving CF x and optimization target CF obj coefficient first decrease at low reduced frequency f r for quasi-steady state then increase, becoming higher than the static state situation. The driving force CF x and the optimization target coefficient CF obj show an optimum for the three different design sail shapes located at f r = 0. 255. This optimum {{is linked to the}} power transmitted to the rig and sail system by the <b>trimming</b> <b>device.</b> The effect of the camber of the design shape is also investigated. The flat mainsail design benefits more than the other mainsail designs from the dynamic trimming compared to their respective static situtation. This study presents dynamic results that cannot be accurately predicted with a quasi-static approach. These results are therefore valuable for future FSI numerical tools validations in unsteady conditions...|$|E

50|$|An anti-servo tab, or anti-balance tab, {{works in}} the {{opposite}} way to a servo tab. It deploys {{in the same direction}} as the control surface, making the movement of the control surface more difficult and requires more force applied to the controls by the pilot. This may seem counter-productive, but it is commonly used on aircraft where the controls are too light or the aircraft requires additional stability in that axis of movement. The anti-servo tab serves mainly to make the controls heavier in feel to the pilot and also to increase stability. An anti-servo tab also functions as a <b>trim</b> <b>device</b> to relieve control pressure and maintain the stabilator in the desired position.|$|R
5000|$|Stabilator or all-moving tailIn {{transonic}} flight shock waves {{generated by the}} front of the tailplane render any elevator unusable. An all-moving tail was developed by the British for the Miles M.52, but first saw actual {{transonic flight}} on the Bell X-1; fortunately Bell Aircraft Corporation had included an elevator <b>trim</b> <b>device</b> that could alter the angle of attack of the entire tailplane. This saved the program from a costly and time-consuming rebuild of the aircraft. Transonic and supersonic aircraft now have all-moving tailplanes to counteract Mach tuck and maintain maneuverability when flying faster than the critical Mach number.

The innovative mechanisms include thrust line translation, life line translation, and auxiliary power control; the conventional mechanisms under investigation are horizontal tails, canards, and variable sweep wings. These mechanisms are tested {{for their ability to}} provide negative static margins for landing approach or relocation of the vectored thrust line nearer the aircraft's center of gravity. The net pitching moment due to wing, flaps, and vectored thrust lift would then be small, making possible beneficial trim forces from small <b>trimming</b> <b>devices.</b> These innovative mechanisms are, however, possibly heavy and must be evaluated on their complexity, reliability, maintainability, and STOL capabilities.

Tests were made over a range of Mach numbers from 2 to 10 at a nominal Reynolds number, based on a length of 2. 3 x 10 to the 8 th and angles of attack from - 4 to 20 deg. The minimum drag forebody provided significant improvements in minimum drag and L/D for the configuration {{as well as a}} longitudinally stabilizing increment. Although the baseline configuration is longitudinally unstable, the L/D improvements at low to moderate angles of attack would enhance cruise performance.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a fully parameterized finite element based tool chain for the structural sizing of transport aircraft. The chain {{consists of two}} model generators, a coupling module, a loads module for the computation of aerodynamic, fuel, landing gear and engine loads {{as well as a}} structural analysis and sizing algorithm. The finite element models of the wing and the empennage are created by the ELWIS multi-model generator, while the corresponding fuselage model is created using the TRAFUMO model generator. The structural coupling comprises the detailed modeling of all key structural elements of the center fuselage area including a keelbeam, bulkheads, sideboxes and lateral panels. The empennage coupling structure includes a reinforcement framework, reinforced frames and a mounting structure for the horizontal tail plane <b>trim</b> <b>device.</b> To establish suitability in preliminary aircraft design, a knowledge-based approach is chosen that enables a fully automatic model generation and coupling on a minimum set of required input parameters. As a central data format for input and output the DLR aircraft parameterization format CPACS is used. Therefore, the chain can be easily embedded in a wider MDA/MDO approach for overall preliminary aircraft design. Finally, first static sizing results are discussed and different validation methods for the static sizing algorithm are presented, including a comparison with a validated analytical method...|$|R
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to determine the static longitudinal stability ad trim characteristics of a sweptback-wtig jet-transport model equipped with an external-flow ~et-au-ted flap. The investigation included tests of the mdel {{to determine the effects of}} wing position, vertical position of the horizontal tail, and size of the horizontal *il. The results of the investigation indicated that static longitudinal stability and trim could be achieved up to a lift coefficient of about 6 with a horizontal tail having an area of about 25 percent of the wing area. In order to achieve this result, it was necessary to locate the horizontal tail well above the chord plane of the wing and to incorporate both variable incidence and an elevator. For the flap-down, power-off condition, the downwash factor was found to be relatively large (0. 8 to 0. 9). The downwash factor decreased with increasing nmmentum coeffi-cient, the greatest reduction occurring for the low tail position. In order to obtain a given amunt of stability, larger tail areas were there-fore required for the low tail position than for the high tail position. Results of calculations comparing the relative merits of various <b>trim</b> <b>devices</b> for use on airplanes equipped with jet-augmented flaps indicated thst a fixed. cansrd surface utilizing Jet augmentation would provide longitudinal trim and stability at a given lift coefficient for less overall jet thrust than a conventional tail, a free-floating canard sur-face, or a trim-~et arrangement.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{magnetic}} thin films with graded or tilted anisotropy are intensively studied for potential applications in spintronic devices. A continuum of stable remanent resistance states is realized in Co/Pd multilayers {{based on a}} perpendicularly magnetized pseudo spin valve (PSV). The Co/Pd multilayers have been deposited using magnetron sputtering. By varying the Co thickness in each repeating unit, a graded anisotropy through the multilayer is achieved. We then incorporate this graded Co/Pd multilayer into a PSV as the free layer. The remanent resistance states are systematically adjustable depending on the reversal field. The gradual reversal of the free layer with applied field and the field-independent fixed layer leads {{to a range of}} stable and reproducible remanent resistance values, as determined by the giant magnetoresistance of the device. An analysis of first-order reversal curves (FORCs) combined with magnetic force microscopy (MFM) shows that the origin of the effect is the field-dependent population of up and down domains in the free layer. Thus, these structures have great potential for applications such as field-tunable resistance <b>trimming</b> <b>devices,</b> memristive devices, or magnetic analog memories with a continuous number of states per memory cell, thereby allowing much higher information storage. We have also successfully realized FePtCu thin films with graded anisotropy. During deposition a compositional gradient is achieved by continuously varying the Cu content from the top to bottom. After annealing at a proper temperature, the top Cu-poor regions remain in the as-deposited soft A 1 phase, while the bottom Cu-rich regions transform into hard L 10 phase. Hence the gradient anisotropy is established through the film thickness. The critical role of the annealing temperatures (TA) on the resultant anisotropy gradient is investigated. Magnetic measurements support the creation of an anisotropy gradient in properly annealed films which exhibit both a reduced coercivity and moderate thermal stability. The reversal mechanism of graded anisotropy has been investigated by alternating gradient magnetometer (AGM) and magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements in combination with the FORC technique. The AGM-FORC analysis clearly shows the soft and hard phases. MOKE-FORC measurement, which preferentially probes the surface of the film, reveals that the soft components are indeed located toward the top surface. We provide a detailed study of the how the anisotropy gradient in a compositional graded FePtCu film gradually develops {{as a function of the}} TA. By utilizing the in-situ annealing and magnetic characterization capability of a physical property measurement system (PPMS), the evolution of the induced anisotropy gradient is elucidated. These results are important and useful for the solving the magnetic ‘‘trilemma’’ of magnetic recording technology. The Co/Pd-NiFe exchange spring system is investigated. Due to the competition between the strong perpendicular anisotropy of the Co/Pd multilayer and the in-plane shape anisotropy of the NiFe, the magnetization in the NiFe tilts out of the film plane. Experimental data from conventional magnetometry, and MFM, along with one-dimensional simulations, show that the titling angle in the NiFe layer is highly tunable from 0 to 60 ° by simply changing the thickness of NiFe. We employed the Co/Pd-NiFe exchange spring system with appropriate NiFe thickness as the polarizer in nano-contact spin torque oscillators (STOs) which show vortex oscillations at low fields...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an ocular micrometer, the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during <b>trimming.</b> Several <b>devices</b> and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967).

40|$|The {{preliminary}} simulated {{and experimental}} {{investigation into the}} use of a wing tip all-moving device for passive gust alleviation and trim / roll control is described. Initial results on a simple rectangular wing demonstrate that the approach is feasible. Further investigations are made using a scaled half model joined-wing sensorcraft and show that through consideration of the attachment position and torsional stiffness it is possible to tune the device throughout flight to maximise the feasible gust response alleviation. Consideration is made of the feasibility of incorporating an adaptive torsional stiffness attachment {{that could be used to}} <b>trim</b> the <b>device</b> for more efficient flight, and also to enable roll control I. Gust Alleviation All aircraft are subjected to atmospheric turbulence of varying degrees of severity. The inherent flexiblity in the aircraft’s structure leads to response to gusts and turbulence of both the flexible and rigid body modes, introducing internal loads into the structure. It is important for the safe design of the aircraft to calculate both response and internal loads, and gust loads are often the critical design case, particularly for large flexible high aspect-ratio structures such as some recent HALE UAV designs, including joined wing configurations 1 - 6.

In {{an ideal}} situation, good {{measuring}} {{system can be}} designed if exact information is known concerning performance and structures involved during the lifetime of the measuring object.

40|$|SAW {{devices are}} {{routinely}} frequency trimmed at the wafer level {{prior to the}} dicing process so to improve yield at the assembly level. The trimming {{can be achieved by}} using wet etching, reactive ion etching, ion beam milling, and other methods. It is also possible to trim the frequency of patterned SAW wafer by depositing dielectric thin films on the wafer but this method is usually done for the purpose of finger shorting protection from metallic particles. Reactive ion etching can be used to <b>trim</b> assembled SAW <b>devices</b> prior to encapsulation. This is seldom employed since it is considered costly, inefficient, and difficult to perform in-situ. In this paper we propose trimming assembled SAW resonator (SAWR) by using the conventional crystal resonator fine-tuning process with gold thin film addition. Nowadays, the fine-tuning process is a necessary step in crystal resonator production. We show that this is a simple and well-controlled method to trim assembled SAW resonator also. This method provides a wide trimming range and the gold film is thin enough not to short out the SAW transducers so that the SAWR’s integrity can be maintained...|$|R
5000|$|In 1935, the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium, Reich Aviation Ministry) invited several {{aviation}} {{companies to}} submit design proposals that would {{compete for the}} production contract for a new Luftwaffe aircraft design suitable for liaison, army co-operation (today called forward air control), and medical evacuation. This resulted in the Messerschmitt Bf 163 and Siebel Si 201 competing against the Fieseler firm's entry. Conceived by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director Erich Bachem, Fieseler's design had a far better short {{take off and landing}} ("STOL") performance. A fixed slat ran along {{the entire length of the}} leading edge of the long wings, while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This was inspired by earlier 1930s Junkers Doppelflügel, [...] "double-wing" [...] aircraft wing control surface design concepts. For the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel's trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located flaps and outboard-located ailerons, which themselves included <b>trim</b> tab <b>devices</b> over half of each aileron's trailing edge length. A design feature rare for land-based aircraft enabled the wings on the Storch to be folded back along the fuselage in a manner similar to the wings of the US Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter. This allowed the aircraft to be carried on a trailer or even towed slowly behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin. The long legs of the main landing gear contained oil-and-spring shock absorbers that had a travel of 40 cm (15-3/4 inches), allowing the aircraft to land on comparatively rough and uneven surfaces - this was combined with a [...] "pre-travel" [...] distance of 20 cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock. In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, Storch. With its very low landing speed the Storch often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards, in strong winds from directly ahead.|$|R

The method {{can be used}} to resolve process-machine problems by re-designing the problematic processing machines or simply used to trim components for various purposes. The trimming process is orchestrated by a trimming plan which consists of sequenced trimming tasks. Elements of each trimming task include function carrier, useful functions, objects, trimming rules, new carriers, trimming problem statement, and trimming method. A 2 -loop depth-first recursive trimming process is proposed to maximize the trimming effect. Applied on a slit-valve failure of a chemical vapor deposition equipment in one of major Taiwanese foundry companies, the proposed problem solving process successfully identified the critical key disadvantages of the problem and solved the slit-valve failure with breakthrough results. A number of solutions were generated by the integrated process which involves a number of TRIZ tools. This paper describes only the solution by the trimming process.
