The objective of the study described here was to clone, functionally characterise and compare expressed fatty acid desaturase genes involved in the production of EPA and DHA in freshwater and marine teleost fish species. Putative fatty acid desaturase cDNAs were isolated and cloned from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> maximus). The enzymic activities of the products of these cDNAs, together with those of cDNAs previously cloned from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), were determined by heterologous expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The carp and turbot desaturase cDNAs included open reading frames of 1335 and 1338 base pairs, respectively, specifying proteins of 444 and 445 amino acids. The protein sequences possessed all the characteristic features of microsomal fatty acid desaturases, including three histidine boxes, two transmembrane regions, and N-terminal cytochrome b 5 domains containing the haem-binding motif, HPGG. Functional expression showed all four fish cDNAs encode basically unifunctional Δ 6 fatty acid desaturase enzymes responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of HUFA from 18 : 3 n- 3 and 18 : 2 n- 6. All the fish desaturases were more active towards the n- 3 substrate with 59. 5 %, 31. 5 %, 23. 1 % and 7. 0 % of 18 : 3 n- 3 being converted to 18 : 4 n- 3 in the case of turbot, trout, seabream and carp, respectively. The enzymes also showed very low, probably physiologically insignificant, levels of Δ 5 desaturase activity, but none of the products showed Δ 4 desaturase activity.

40|$|Ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus) is a {{well-known}} freshwater fish in Estonia. The typology index of P. Kippar (1986 : 166) introduces 256 narrative types of Estonian origin known locally, which mention a huge ruff, while M. Kuusi (1976 : 311 - 313) argues that narratives concerning the huge ruff (AT 1960 B) figure only in the Finnish lore. As sprat (Sprattus sprattus balticus) became an important fishing article only in the late 19 th century, it has no significant role in folk belief. The motif of a golden fish, who brings good fishing luck, is associated not just with the metal fish figures depicted in sacred chapels, but has common features with the pre-Christian fishing god. The embodiment of the golden fish in nature is either Baltic herring or some other fish. Bream (Abramis brama) is often mentioned {{in connection with the}} spawning season in spring, legends focus mainly on fishing (a supernatural protector of fish restrains the fisher; the haul is smaller because of people's greed). The origin of the name of minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) (in Estonian: lepamaim, or leppkala) seems to lie in the reddish colour of the fish's lower side (in the archaic linguistic expression lepp carried the meaning of blood). The same name has been used to mark other smaller shoal fish. The unique shape of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) and <b>turbot</b> (Skophthalmus (<b>Psetta)</b> maximus) is explained in several myths of origin. The most popular explanation is that they originate from half-eaten fish. The reason why its mouth is crooked (it snaps at the God) is explained in the narratives from the western islands of Estonia. AT 250 A versions in the Estonian language are short and also refer to the flounder's outward appearance. The Livonians, who were the main competitors on the fishing waters, are known to have possessed the magic skills of relocating and «sweeping off» the flounders. Burbot (Lota lota) is caught by ice fishing during the spawning time, therefore it is connected to certain popular calendar days (e. g. the Twelfth Day on January 6, or St. Anthony's Day on January 17) in folk belief. Salmon (Salmo salar) as a predatory fish has a wide chin which swelling and curving on male fish during the mating season is particularly spectacular. An Estonian-Finnish-Karelian runo song describes the making of a mythic zither kannel (finnish kantele) - a local zithertype stringinstrument out of salmon chinbone. The Baltic four-horned sculpin (Triglopsis (Oncocottus) quadricornis quadricornis) has very conspicuous four spines on top of its head. Its resemblance to an ox or devil is reflected in the numerous popular terms. The unique appearance of the fish has inspired the negative attitude towards it. Unlike any other fish it has also earned a reputation of a fish created by a witch...|$|R
40|$|The correct {{identification}} of the species of origin in cell culture procedures {{as well as the}} detection of eventual cross-contamination by other cells are of essential importance to ensure the correctness of all experimental trials. In this connection, PCR is a fundamental technique to identify the occurrence of genetic information belonging to a defined species. In this paper the correspondence between the known sequences for <b>turbot</b> <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> (formerly Scophthalmus maximus) and those obtained from TV-I cells from juvenile Psetta maxima was searched by PCR by analysing the Nramp (Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein) gene, which is known to occur in several tissues of turbot and in a turbot embrional cell line. The obtained results showed an high degree of homology of the amplified fragment of TV-I cell line with the Nramp coding region of Teleosts, and a high degree of probability of the occurrence of mRNA belonging to Psetta maxima; so it could be excluded at a greater extent a contamination by genetic material of other organisms and the occurrence of information coming from Teleosts in TV-I cells was confirmed...|$|E
30|$|The {{most obvious}} effects were {{shown by the}} histopathological investigations. Here, fish from both sites, up- and {{downstream}} of the SSB, revealed strong reactions or severe health impairments in the examined tissues. The observed effects represent cellular reactions, which {{can be caused by}} a great variety of chemical stressors (e.g., heavy metals, organic compounds, salts) and may consequently result in a strong impairment or even loss of function in the affected organs [21]. The gills of the examined fish revealed hyperplasia and hypertrophy of epithelial cells, epithelial liftings, fusion of secondary lamellae, and sporadically occurring necrosis in cells of the secondary lamellae. The observed reactions may result in a reduction of oxygen uptake into the organism and thus negatively affect its metabolism. Santos et al. [9] observed similar reactions in the gills of juvenile Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) after a chronic exposure to naphthalene. Barja-Fernández et al. [56] exposed <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> to BDE- 47 in the lower µg/L range and observed fusions of the secondary lamellae as well as hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelial cells. Shao et al. [57] exposed rainbow trout gill cells (RTgill-W 1) to BDE- 47 and observed a loss of the cell viability in this cell type. In liver, we observed vacuolizations, a depletion of the glycogen content, an increased number of melanomacrophages, a disintegrated structure of hepatocytes, cellular hypertrophy, and irregularly shaped nuclei. These reactions indicate an increased metabolic rate, which in turn can be an indicator of the metabolic degradation of harmful substances like, for example, PBDEs and PAHs. The livers of <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> showed similar reactions (irregular morphology of hepatocytes, cellular and nuclear hypertrophy) after exposure to BDE- 47 as demonstrated in the work of Barja-Fernández et al. [56]. A comparison of our results with the literature shows that the analyzed substances like PAHs and PBDEs probably contributed to the pathologic alterations in the investigated fish tissues. However, a clear link between the observed effects and the analyzed substances cannot be established, since the chemical analyses focused on substances which mainly represent priority substances. The presented chemical data only give an overview on the general status of pollution in the investigated Argen River section. It can be assumed that, in addition, other unidentified pollutants acted as additional stressors and contributed to the observed effects.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Juvenile <b>turbot</b> <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> (Linnaeus, 1758) (15. 23 – 2. 99 g) {{were fed}} to {{satiation}} with a commercial extruded feed over a 60 -day period. Feeding regimens were {{twice a day}} (TD), every other day (EOD), and 2 -day intervals (TDI). Fish were kept in seawater (18 ppt) at 5 - 7. 5 ¡C from January 21 to March 23, 2004. Feed conversion rate (FCR) and the protein efficiency ratios (PER) were within the ranges of 1. 12 - 1. 14 and 2. 26 - 2. 29, respectively. While the maximum relative growth rate (RGR), weight gain, and specific growth rate (SGR) were recorded in the TD group, they were lower in the EOD and TDI groups. Both the SGR and RGR increased as feeding frequency increased. The feeding frequency influenced the chemical composition of the fish. Lipid and protein content of the fish increased in the TD group. In terms of SGR and RGR, {{it can be concluded}} that the best growth rates of Black Sea turbot cultured at 5 - 7. 5 ¡C were obtained from the fish in the TD and EOD groups...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{infection}} with Pseudomonas anguilliseptica was performed both by intraperitoneal (i. p.) and bath route on juvenile <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> {{in order to}} evaluate the pathology induced. Turbot {{was found to be}} sensitive to i. p. challenge (1. 7 × 106 CFU/fish) but no to bath exposure. The i. p. challenge induced septicaemic infection and mortality. Externally, moribund fish showed distended abdomen and pale areas at day 9. The gross pathological internal signs present were abundant ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, pale and enlarged spleen, pale and friable liver, and congestive and dilated gut with yellowish exudates. On histopathological examination, bacterial invasion was common in all the tissues studied but the most prominent pathological changes were observed in gut, spleen and kidney after 7 day with features of necrosis. The immunohistochemical findings support the widespread localization of the bacteria after the i. p. injection since the P. anguilliseptica was detected in spleen from day 1 post injection, in liver, kidney and gut from day 4, in muscle from day 7 and in brain from day 9. The difficulties in infecting healthy fish by bath challenge {{can be explained by the}} opportunistic nature of this pathogen...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, {{primarily}} {{because of the lack of}} sheltered marine areas, the improvement in the fish production can be achieved through the installation of off-shore fish-farms utilizing submersible and submerged cages. These cage typologies have been proven to be effective solutions leading, in case of unfavourable sea-conditions, to a reduced risk of damage for the structures as well as a lower level of stress for fishes. In this paper, after a description of two innovative cage prototypes, the mooring systems relative to such cage typologies are described, paying particular attention to the problems related to their installation. Particularly, the design of a submerged cage to be positioned at different depths, ranging between 7 and 40 meters, and the relative mooring system has been carried out with the aim to find environmental conditions suitable to introduce, in the Mediterranean Sea, the farming of the <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima).</b> The results of the experiences carried out so far point out the validity of the system employed and show that the environmental conditions found in deep sea waters are suitable for turbot farming in many areas of the Mediterranean sea...|$|E
40|$|Soybean {{meal and}} locally-produced anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) {{fishmeal}} were evaluated as protein {{sources in the}} intensive culture of Black Sea <b>turbot,</b> <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima,</b> by comparing them with imported Alaskan fishmeal. Three diets were prepared. One contained imported fish- meal and the second anchovy fishmeal. In the third diet, part of the anchovy fishmeal was replaced by soybean meal. The dietary protein levels were adjusted to approximately 50 %. Juveniles (avg wt 8. 2 g) were reared for 61 days in triplicate tanks. Growth and feed efficiency in fish fed the anchovy fishmeal diet were inferior to those of fish fed the imported fishmeal diet, indicating {{the need to improve}} the quality of the anchovy fishmeal. Partial replacement of the anchovy fishmeal by soybean meal resulted in worse growth performance. The low growth rates obtained with the anchovy fishmeal diet and the anchovy plus soybean diet were accompanied by low lipid and glycogen accumulation. Fatty acid compositions of the muscle and liver were not influenced by the dietary protein source. The inferior results with the soybean meal diet might have been due to effects of anti-nutrients on the digestive system...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{triploid}} fish may be {{of interest}} in research, e. g. study of how this condition affects the size and activity of cells. In addition, triploid fish are sterile and production of triploids in fish species that are marketed after reaching sexual maturity {{may be of}} economic interest. In the present study, the effects of triploidy on the activity of several components of the innate immune system of <b>turbot</b> (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> L) were determined. Triploid turbot had bigger cells (erythrocytes and neutrophils) {{but the number of}} blood erythrocytes, leucocytes and thrombocytes was lower than in diploid fish. The differential cell count was similar in both types of fish. The respiratory burst and the phagocytic activities were higher in neutrophils of triploid turbot. However, because the number of neutrophils was higher in diploids, the total respiratory burst activity and the phagocytosis per microliter of blood was similar in both types of fish. No differences were found in serum complement, lysozyme or bactericidal activities. The results indicate that the activities of the humoral components of the innate immune system tested are similar in diploid and triploid fish and that the lower leucocyte number found in triploids is compensated for by higher cell activity.
