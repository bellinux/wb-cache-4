5|$|Morphological and {{allozyme}} analyses {{have agreed}} that the common <b>thresher</b> is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye <b>thresher</b> and the pelagic <b>thresher</b> (A. pelagicus). The closest relative of this species within the family may be a fourth, unrecognized <b>thresher</b> shark species off Baja California, reported from allozyme evidence by Blaise Eitner in 1995. However, {{the existence of this}} fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources.|$|E
5|$|While {{any large}} shark {{is capable of}} inflicting injury and thus merits respect, the common <b>thresher</b> poses little danger to humans. Most divers report that they are shy and {{difficult}} to approach underwater. The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the <b>thresher</b> shark and four attacks on boats, which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture. There is an unsubstantiated report of a common <b>thresher</b> acting aggressively towards a spearfisherman off New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common <b>thresher</b> has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common <b>thresher</b> averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common <b>thresher</b> lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E

5000|$|Any {{reference}} to the act of <b>threshing</b> or to the <b>threshing</b> board itself is incomplete without a {{reference to}} the <b>threshing</b> floor, because the work of <b>threshing</b> by necessity requires a <b>threshing</b> floor. The first biblical mention of the <b>threshing</b> floor is in [...] As such, it was not a shed, building, or any place covered with a roof and surrounded by walls, but a circular piece of ground from fifty to a hundred feet in diameter, in the open air, on elevated ground, and made smooth, hardy, and clean. Here the grain was <b>threshed</b> and winnowed.|$|R
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} <b>thresher</b> is {{minimally}} dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common <b>thresher</b> has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the <b>thresher</b> shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common <b>thresher</b> {{fisheries}} via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common <b>thresher</b> fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common <b>thresher</b> fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common <b>thresher</b> stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common <b>thresher,</b> as Squalus vulpinus, was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. In 1810, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias macrourus from a <b>thresher</b> shark caught off Sicily. Later authors recognized the genus Alopias as valid while synonymizing A. macrourus with S. vulpinus, and thus the common thresher's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the arrival}} of combine harvesters, which reap, <b>thresh</b> and clean grain in a single process, the {{traditional}} methods of <b>threshing</b> cereals and some legumes were those described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, with three variants: [...] "The cereals are <b>threshed</b> in some places with the <b>threshing</b> board on the <b>threshing</b> floor; in others they are trampled by a train of horses, and in others they are beaten with flails".|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>threshing</b> stones quickly {{faded as}} they were {{superseded}} by mechanized forms of <b>threshing,</b> especially by <b>threshing</b> machines, and eventually all farmers quit using them by around 1900 to 1905.|$|R
5|$|The long upper {{tail fin}} lobe {{of the common}} <b>thresher</b> is used to strike and {{incapacitate}} prey.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>thresher</b> is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped trunk and a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are {{moderately}} large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other <b>thresher</b> sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>thresher</b> {{is widely}} caught by {{offshore}} longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common <b>thresher</b> take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the <b>thresher</b> sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus anatomy {{exhibits}} another {{feature that}} may have a modern homology: its long tail resembled that of the <b>thresher</b> shark, employed to slap the water to herd and stun shoals of fish before devouring them (Oliver et al., 2013).|$|E
5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} <b>thresher,</b> the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common <b>thresher</b> has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
50|$|Hand <b>threshing</b> was laborious, with {{a bushel}} of wheat taking about an hour. In the late 18th century, before <b>threshing</b> was mechanized, {{about one-quarter of}} {{agricultural}} labor was devoted to it. Industrialization of <b>threshing</b> began in 1786 with {{the invention of the}} <b>threshing</b> machine by Scotsman Andrew Meikle. Today, in developed areas, it is now mostly done by machine, usually by a combine harvester, which harvests, <b>threshes,</b> and winnows the grain while it is still in the field.|$|R
25|$|<b>Threshing</b> machines, {{which were}} a novelty {{at the end}} of the 18th century, began being widely {{introduced}} in the 1830s and 1840s. Mechanized <b>threshing</b> required less than half the labor of hand <b>threshing.</b>|$|R
40|$|In czech {{agriculture}} harvesting <b>threshing</b> machines of many {{producers are}} used. They often differ in main operative parts construction and complementary equipments.

5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, <b>thresher</b> shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their {{underwater}} food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas has {{the ability}} to {{disperse}} by a variety of mechanisms, including ballast water, ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, migration of crab larvae on ocean currents, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. <b>Thresher</b> et al. found C.maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} <b>thresher</b> {{developed}} in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common <b>thresher</b> population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E

5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for <b>threshing</b> floors. The longer the barn was, the more <b>threshing</b> floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} <b>threshing</b> floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three <b>threshing</b> floors, allowing much more grain to be <b>threshed</b> at one time.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{of the use}} of <b>threshing</b> {{stones in}} various forms date from the Roman era, but {{eventually}} it became the method of <b>threshing</b> grain by the Molotschna Mennonite farmers in the Ukraine from about 1840 to 1900. The <b>threshing</b> stone became the preferred method used to knock the grain from the head because it was less labor-intensive than the use of the traditional <b>threshing</b> flail.|$|R
5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. <b>Thresher</b> sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and <b>thresher</b> sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and <b>thresher</b> sharks.|$|E
5|$|All three <b>thresher</b> shark {{species were}} reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse}} of the Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
