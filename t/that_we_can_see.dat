25|$|The {{discovery}} of new foods or preparation methods went through several stages of understanding. Firstly cocoa was {{understood as a}} food and later as a pleasant taste. The latter was only possible through adapting the food to flavours previously known. It is in these first encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with cocoa <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that the preparation stage was adapted, it was sweetened and flavoured with other spices such as cinnamon and served warm. After {{that they had a}} better understanding of the value of chocolate. Those three simple changes distinguished the chocolate consumed by the Spanish colonisers from the chocolate consumed by the natives. The same pattern occurs in other foods enjoyed at the time by the natives and Spanish. although none of those had an acceptance and a global demand in proportion similar to that of chocolate.|$|E

Our bodies, for instance, are in life given {{to us from the}} inside, which allows us, for example, to move our hands, and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in the world.|$|E

2500|$|The Omphalos {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore no evidence <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable. The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [...] "starlight problem". The idea has been criticised as Last Thursdayism, and {{on the grounds that it}} requires a deliberately deceptive creator.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} these decisions, the Second Circuit had ruled {{in this case that}} the {{religious}} nature of the Good News Club's message meant that it [...] "fell outside the bounds of" [...] speech related to [...] "pure moral and character development", and hence was not entitled to First Amendment protection. [...] The majority on the Supreme Court [...] "disagreed that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. [...] What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons." [...] Instruction related to morals and values from a religious perspective does not somehow [...] "taint" [...] that instruction so as to alter the viewpoint such instruction takes. [...] Accordingly, Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Cornish et al. {{found this}} lower {{bound for the}} {{diameter}} of the whole universe (not just the observable part), if we postulate that the universe is finite in size due to its having a nontrivial topology, with this lower bound based on the estimated current distance between points <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{on opposite sides of the}} cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). If the whole universe is smaller than this sphere, then light has had time to circumnavigate it since the Big Bang, producing multiple images of distant points in the CMBR, which would show up as patterns of repeating circles. Cornish et al. looked for such an effect at scales of up to 24 gigaparsecs (...) and failed to find it, and suggested that if they could extend their search to all possible orientations, they would then [...] "be able to exclude the possibility that we live in a universe smaller than 24 Gpc in diameter". The authors also estimated that with [...] "lower noise and higher resolution CMB maps (from WMAP's extended mission and from Planck), we will be able to search for smaller circles and extend the limit to ~28 Gpc." [...] This estimate of the maximum lower bound that can be established by future observations corresponds to a radius of 14 gigaparsecs, or around 46 billion light years, about the same as the figure for the radius of the visible universe (whose radius is defined by the CMBR sphere) given in the opening section. A 2012 preprint by most of the same authors as the Cornish et al. paper has extended the current lower bound to a diameter of 98.5% {{the diameter of the}} CMBR sphere, or about 26 Gpc.|$|E

60|$|I {{have stated}} in the first chapter, that at {{whatever}} age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle. But variations which, for all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> might have appeared either earlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is invariably the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened {{at an earlier age}} in the child than in the parent.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} no such fear now. The {{recognized}} system of lending upon approved security for a fair and moderate rate of interest removes the irksome, galling sense of obligation, and enables any man to borrow with a feeling that if he receives an obligation he is also conferring one; that if he makes ten per cent. by trading, or a good stipend by his degree, he will divide his profits fairly with the man who served him, and that he is helping him in his turn to keep his money together {{for the sake of his}} children after him.
