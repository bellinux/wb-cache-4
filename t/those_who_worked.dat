Among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> to alleviate children's suffering were Marinić, Budisavljević, and Davila. One survivor, Milan Vujić, {{was taken from}} the camp when he was sick and cared for {{until the end of the}} war by a Croatian family in Koprivnica. They had never accepted the Ustaše regime or its policies. Many Croats, he stated, took in and even adopted children from Jastrebarsko and treated them kindly.|$|E

The councillors of Caulfield, Victoria, organised a fund to replace the lost medical equipment, opening with a donation of AU£2,000. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> on Centaurs conversion contributed money towards a replacement, and employees of Ansett Airways pledged to donate an hour's pay towards the fitting out of such a replacement.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E

5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in the sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting a minimum wage. Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked public outrage and inspired many complaints.|$|E
5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as the majority of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, {{while the majority of}} the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Sapumal Kumaraya (also {{known as}} Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom {{on behalf of}} the Kotte kingdom is {{credited}} with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple. Singai Pararasasegaram is credited with building the Sattanathar temple, the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the Veerakaliamman temple. He built a pond called Yamuneri and filled it with water from the Yamuna river of North India, which is considered holy by Hindus. He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple, as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneshwaram Temple. Major temples were normally maintained by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> in the temple, unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka, where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue.|$|E

Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987 she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age, but has stated that she has not had surgery to make her face look younger. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.|$|E

5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries were {{a period}} of huge {{economic}} growth in England. The population of England rose from around 1.5million in 1086 to around 4or 5million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for {{the years of the}} Anarchy, most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked,</b> in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or the clerics. Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified {{at the start of the}} period, although they were increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many canals, where navvies {{were brought}} into the {{neighbourhood}} {{to carry out the}} work, the Earl employed local men on the project, most of them already employed by him, and a clergyman praised him for this when writing in 1808, as it led to much less disruption, but provided increased income for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> on the scheme. Wages rose from 8 or 9 shillings (40-45p) per week to 14 or 15 shillings (70-75p). During his life, the Earl invested some £100,000 in waterways, some in his native county of Sussex, but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth. Between 1802 and 1831, the average income from the canal was around £550 per year. Competition arrived in 1859, when the Mid-Sussex Railway opened a line from Horsham through Pulborough to Petworth. Traffic declined, and by the 1880s, the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats, although it was not officially abandoned until 1936.|$|E
