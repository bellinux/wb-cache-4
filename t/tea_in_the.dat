5|$|During the British Raj, Darjeeling's {{temperate}} climate {{led to its}} development as a hill station for British residents seeking to escape the summer heat of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly. Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and Lieutenant Robert Napier were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849. The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842. In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850. Commercial cultivation of <b>tea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there. Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the Bengal Presidency after 1864. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881 further hastened {{the development of the}} region. In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major landslides that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.|$|E

He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having <b>tea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E
5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to <b>Téa.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Large-scale {{economic}} issues {{played a role}} in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or manufactured goods was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, coffee from the West Indies began to replace <b>tea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an overstocked market, resulting in bankruptcies and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826–27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841–43, following the Panic of 1837.|$|E

40|$|Adulterated green teas {{expanded}} {{with the}} development of Chinese green tea overseas market. It was British East India Company that monopolized the sales channel of Chinese green tea after the 17 th century. For this reason, Britain was <b>the</b> first country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world to test the quality of Chinese green tea and raised a “Lie tea” problem. A very considerable amount of low-quality green <b>tea</b> was sold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British <b>tea</b> market <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19 th century, and many British researchers had studied imported green tea as an experiment object and constantly questioned the quality of <b>tea</b> leaves. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> latter part of the 19 th century, the total amount of Chinese green tea exported to the United States exceeded that to the British, and the United States became the major export counterpart country of Chinese green tea and the largest foreign market, and the market for adulterated green <b>tea</b> was set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States as well. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States at that time, the law concerning tea leaves had not yet been developed, and the tea market had not been regulated. Thus, extensive of spurious <b>tea</b> was flooded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American <b>tea</b> market. According to the first tea act, an act to prevent the importation of adulterated and spurious <b>Teas,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States conducted <b>in</b> 1883, <b>the</b> United States inspected imported tea leaves with inspection institutions in customs, import {{of a large number of}} adulterated tea was strictly prohibited. On this account, the America’s newspaper of 1883 was picked up much about adulterated teas. Thus, this paper examines the credibility of articles mainly on newspaper reports on tea adulteration issue published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> America’s newspaper <b>in</b> 1883, and examines the influence of adulterated <b>tea</b> <b>in</b> American society. 文部科学省グローバルCOEプログラム 関西大学文化交渉学教育研究拠点松浦章教授古稀記念号[東アジアの歴史と動態...|$|R
