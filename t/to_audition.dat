The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went <b>to</b> <b>audition</b> for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended <b>to</b> <b>audition</b> for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her <b>to</b> <b>audition</b> for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her reading. From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989.
