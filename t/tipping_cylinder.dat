40|$|Understanding cardiac {{function}} in developing larval fishes {{is crucial for}} assessing their physiological condition and overall health. Cardiac output measurements in transparent fish larvae and other vertebrates have long been made by analyzing videos of the beating heart, and modeling this structure using a conventional simple prolate spheroid shape model. However, the larval fish heart changes shape during early development and subsequent maturation, but no consideration {{has been made of}} the effect of different heart geometries on cardiac output estimation. The present study assessed the validity of three different heart models (the “standard” prolate spheroid model as well as a <b>cylinder</b> and cone <b>tip</b> + <b>cylinder</b> model) applied to digital images of complete cardiac cycles in larval mahi-mahi and red drum. The inherent error of each model was determined to allow for more precise calculation of stroke volume and cardiac output. The conventional prolate spheroid and cone <b>tip</b> + <b>cylinder</b> models yielded significantly different stroke volume values at 56 hpf in red drum and from 56 to 104 hpf in mahi. End-diastolic and stroke volumes modeled by just a simple cylinder shape were 30 – 50 % higher compared to the conventional prolate spheroid. However, when these values of stroke volume multiplied by heart rate to calculate cardiac output, no significant differences between models emerged because of considerable variability in heart rate. Essentially, the conventional prolate spheroid shape model provides the simplest measurement with lowest variability of stroke volume and cardiac output. However, assessment of heart function—especially if stroke volume is the focus of the study—should consider larval heart shape, with different models being applied on a species-by-species and developmental stage-by-stage basis for best estimation of cardiac output...|$|R

40|$|Cylindrical {{particles}} {{offer the}} opportunity to develop controlled and sustained release systems for the respiratory tract. One reason is that macrophages can phagocyte such particles only from either of the two ends. We investigated the uptake behaviour of murine alveolar macrophages incubated with elongated submicron-structured particles. For that purpose, fluorescent model silica nanoparticles were interconnected with the biocompatible polysaccharide agarose, building up cylindrical particles within the pores of track-etched membranes. In contrast to common approaches we determined the uptake at different time points with scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and the combination of both techniques - correlative microscopy (CLEM). As a consequence, we could securely identify uptake events and observe in detail the engulfment of particles and confirm, that phagocytosis could only be observed from the <b>tips</b> of the <b>cylinders.</b> CLEM allowed a comparison of the uptake measured with different techniques at identical macrophages.

40|$|Plants have {{developed}} a range of strategies for resisting environmental stresses. One {{of the most common}} is the synthesis and deposition of callose, which functions as a barrier against stress factor penetration. The aim of our study was to examine whether callose forms an efficient barrier against Pb penetration in the roots of Lemna minor L. exposed to this metal. The obtained results showed that Pb induced callose synthesis in L. minor roots, but it was not deposited regularly in all tissues and cells. Callose occurred mainly in the protoderm and in the centre of the root <b>tip</b> (procambial central <b>cylinder).</b> Moreover, continuous callose bands, which could form an efficient barrier for Pb penetration, were formed only in the newly formed and anticlinal cell walls (CWs); while in other CWs, callose formed only small clusters or incomplete bands. Such an arrangement of callose within root CWs inefficiently protected the protoplast from Pb penetration. As a result, Pb was commonly present inside the root cells. In the light of the results, the barrier role of callose against metal ion penetration appears to be less obvious than previously believed. It was indicated that induction of callose synthesis is not enough for a successful blockade of the stress factor penetration. Furthermore, {{it would appear that the}} pattern of callose distribution has an important role in this defence strategy...|$|R

Recent studies have {{showed that a}} group of plantMATE genes encodes citrate transporter, which are involved in thedetoxificationof aluminiumor translocationof iron from the roots to the shoots. In this study,we isolated twohomologous genes (ScFRDL 1 and ScFRDL 2) from this family in rye (Secale cereale L.). ScFRDL 1 shared 94. 2 % identity with HvAACT 1, an Al-activated citrate transporter in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and ScFRDL 2 shared 80. 6 % identity with OsFRDL 2, a putative Al-responsive protein in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Both genes were mainly expressed in the roots, however, they showed different expression patterns. Expression of ScFRDL 1 was unaffected by Al treatment, but up-regulated byFe-deficiency treatment. In contrast, expressionofScFRDL 2 wasgreatly inducedbyAlbut not byFedeficiency. The Al-induced up-regulation of ScFRDL 2 was found in both the root tips and basal roots.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{numerical}} study of heat transfer characteristics from the bottom <b>tip</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> spinning about a vertical axis in an infinitely saturated porous medium. The problem is axisymmetic. The non-dimensionalized governing equations are solved using the SIMPLER algorithm on a staggered grid. The influence of rotational Reynolds numbers and Darcy numbers on the heat transfer for a Grashof number of 10 (4) and Prandtl number of 7. 0 is studied. It is found that for very high Darcy numbers, {{over a wide range}} of rotational Reynolds numbers, the heat transfer takes place mainly due to conduction. The convective heat transfer takes place for lower Darcy numbers and for higher rotational Reynolds numbers. Moreover, there is a rapid increase in the overall Nusselt number below a certain Darcy number with increase in the rotational Reynolds numbers. The effect of the Darcy number and the rotational Reynolds number on the heat transfer and fluid flow in the porous medium is depicted in the form of streamline and isotherm plots.

Designed as a prototype of instruments for measuring the liquid-water and ice contents of lunar and planetary soils, the apparatus could also be utilized for similar purposes in research and agriculture involving terrestrial desert soils and sands, and perhaps for measuring ice buildup on aircraft surfaces. This instrument is an improved version of the apparatus described in Measuring Low Concentrations of Liquid Water and Ice in Soil (NPO- 41822), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 33, No. 2 (February 2009), page 22. The designs of both versions {{are based on the}} fact that the electrical behavior of a typical soil sample is well approximated by a network of resistors and capacitors in which resistances decrease and capacitances increase (and the magnitude and phase angle of impedance changes accordingly) with increasing water content. The previous version included an impedance spectrometer and a jar into which a sample of soil was placed. Four stainless-steel screws at the bottom of the jar were used as electrodes of a fourpoint impedance probe connected to the spectrometer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the turbulence field in an optical diesel engine operated under motored conditions using both large eddy simulation (LES) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The study was performed in a laboratory optical diesel engine based on a recent production engine from VOLVO Car. PIV is used to study the flow field in the cylinder, particularly inside the piston bowl that is also optical accessible. LES is used to investigate in detail the structure of the turbulence, the vortex cores, and the temperature field in the entire engine, all within a single engine cycle. The LES results are compared with the PIV measurements in a 40 x 28 mm domain ranging from the nozzle <b>tip</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> wall. The LES grid consists of 1283 cells. The grid dynamically adjusts itself as the piston moves in the cylinder so that the engine cylinder, including the piston bowl, is described by the grid. In the intake phase the large-scale swirling and tumbling flow streams are shown to be responsible for the generation of large-scale vortex pipes which break down to small-scale turbulent eddies. In the later phase of compression turbulence is mainly produced in the engine bowl. The bore wall and the piston bowl wall heat the fluid near the walls. Turbulence and the large-scale coherent vortex shedding due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are responsible for the enhanced heat transfer between the bulk flow and the walls.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{simulate}} {{the flow of}} an electrically conducting fluid past an obstacle placed inside a duct {{under the influence of}} an externally applied magnetic field. Three different obstacles are considered: a circular and a square cylinder spanning over the full height of the duct and a square cylinder spanning over the half height of the duct. The magnetic field is oriented along the cylinder axis and the duct is electrically insulating. In a first stage of the thesis, we perform a parametric study over both Ha and Re in the case where both Ha ≫ 1 and N ≫ 1 with 2 D simulations using the quasi- 2 D flow model by [165]. In particular, we provide the first explanation of the collapse of the regular Kármán vortex street observed experimentally by [180]. We also derive two different scaling laws linking the evolutions of the flow coefficients and either Re/Ha or Re/Ha 0. 8. The second phase of the thesis is dedicated {{to the development of a}} 3 D MHD capable code to solve the flow equations with the inductionless approximation. This code is used to investigate the 3 D MHD flow past a truncated square cylinder in a duct. We explain the different stages of elaboration of our code and validate its performances to MHD duct flows and cylinder wakes. We also implement a wall function at the interface between the Hartmann layers and the bulk flow. The non-MHD flow past the truncated cylinder is simulated for 10 ≤ Re ≤ 400. In particular, the early stages of the unsteady flow regime is characterised by a regular symmetric procession of hairpin vortices. We explain the formation mechanism of these vortices and its evolution when Re is increased. Finally, we investigate the MHD flow past the electrically insulating truncated cylinder at Ha= 100 and 200 for Re up to 1000. The flow dynamics is strongly 2 D with the presence of a Hunt’s wake at very low Re. The unsteady regime leads to the development of a Kármán vortex street. Switching to a perfectly conducting truncated square cylinder enhances the braking of the flow by the Lorentz force in the region above the <b>cylinder</b> <b>tip.</b> NB some of the mathematical symbols in this abstract may not display correctly; please consult the PDF file for the definitive version of the abstract...|$|R
40|$|A {{circular}} cylinder {{with a free}} end {{is one of the}} simplest possible three­ dimensional structures, yet flow around such a body is complex and not well understood. Numerous previous studies have examined this flow situation; however there is disagreement within the literature about the exact nature of the flow behaviour. The primary dispute is whether a pair of counter-rotating trailing vortices exists near the free end or whether the Kármán vortices are inclined near the cylinder free end and attach onto the body. There is a distinct lack of quantitative wake velocity results from previous work. Therefore, the focus {{of this study is to}} obtain such results in order to determine the structure of the wake. Velocity measurements were made in the wake of various {{circular cylinder}}s mounted vertically perpendicular to a horizontal ground plane. Experiments were conducted in the subcritical Reynolds number regime at ReD = 6 x 104 using a seven-hole pressure probe capable of determining the time-averaged velocity vector. From the literature, there is evidence that the flow pattern is sensitive to the cylinder aspect ratio and boundary layer thickness relative to the cylinder height. Therefore, the aspect ratio was varied from 3 to 9 by changing the cylinder height while keeping the boundary layer height to cylinder diameter ratio constant at 2. 5. For the higher aspect ratio cylinders, results indicate that there are streamwise vortical structures near both ends of the circular cylinder with the vortex pair near the <b>tip</b> of the <b>cylinder</b> much stronger than near the base. As well, thermal anemometry measurements show that the periodicity of the wake weakens near the cylinder ends, with the peak of the power spectrum of the velocity fluctuations being more broadbanded. This suggests that there is indeed a complicated streamwise vortex structure near the free end that is likely composed of inclined Kármán vortices interacting with a strong downwash flow. The strong downwash flow toward the ground plane in this region would act to increase the vorticity of the inclined Kármán vortices while moving the vortices toward the ground plane as they travel downstream. The circulation of the vortex structures becomes weaker downstream and the structures grow in size as additional fluid is entrained. There is also a slight spreading of the tip structures as they travel downstream. When the cylinder aspect ratio is reduced to 3, the lower vortical structures disappear while the strong tip vortex structures remain and a vortex shedding peak is still present in the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations very near the ground plane...|$|R

In industrial milling operations that use comminution and wet-comminution techniques, {{the reduction of}} the particle size is usually achieved through crushing the sample with a material harder than the product. These methods are convenient when the required median particle size is above 400 um. However, to obtain post-milling particle distributions with 85 % sub-micron particles (in number) is both energy intensive, and time consuming. For conventional milling machines, to have the required output in several ton/hr of a product, having a large number of particles in the micron or sub-micron sizes at an affordable rate is cumbersome. Here, a wet-comminution machine that has shown to achieve the aforementioned milestones in the laboratory scale is studied. However, when the machine is scaled to industrial processes, it was recorded that some of the product variables are difficult to scale. In these studies, we attempt to understand the mechanisms by which this machine operates in order to achieve successful scaling. The apparatus operates completely on fluid mechanics principles, it consists of two concentric cylinders, the inner cylinder that has a smaller radius than the outer, rotates while the larger is held stationary. The inner cylinder is also shorter in length than outer, hollow in the inside and has transversal holes where the shaft attaches to the apparatus. The apparatus can operate in batch condition, where the liquid volume is much less than the volume of the apparatus, typically 0. 3 Vt, 0. 42 Vt and 0. 54 Vt. In addition, the apparatus can operate with throughflow, which the upper plate covering the apparatus is reduced in radius. Two component Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) was used to obtain even-time averaged statistics of the azimuthal and axial velocities, in the gap and underneath the impeller. Also, Flow Visualization using Kalliroscopic particles was performed as means of observing large scale structures in the gap. Moreover, single plane Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to acquire statistics of the axial and radial velocities in the gap, and both underneath as well as above the inner cylinder. It was found that at both throughflow conditions, the topology of the apparatus creates a free spinning boundary both at the bottom and above the inner cylinder. Near the bottom, the thickness of the boundary was found to decrease with Reynolds number to a limiting value, where Re; is based on gap thickness and inner <b>cylinder</b> <b>tip</b> speed. For Re > 2546, the liquid/air interface thickness is constant for a given holding volume. In the regions above and underneath the inner cylinder, corner vortices were detected; if viewing the left-hand-side, the lower one rotating counter clockwise, while the upper rotates clockwise. The thickness of these vortices was found to be constant for various axial flows at Re = 1110 and 2230. The radial length scale of the stationary vortices was found to be ~ 2. 5 d;. The flow generated inside of the gap was characterized to have Taylor vortex signatures. It was found that the length scale of the Taylor vortices in the gap is rather insensitive to Reynolds number or holding volume ratio. The average vortex pair wavelength; was found to be 3. 6 d. Average flow statistics in batch condition indicate that in the gap, at Re = 1110 and 2230, the azimuthal velocity is 0. 5 U over much of the length. Similarly, {{it was found that the}} net axial flow through the gap is close to zero...|$|R
