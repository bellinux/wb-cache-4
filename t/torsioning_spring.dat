40|$|In a <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> {{the spring}} {{action is a}} result of the {{relationships}} between the torque applied in twisting the spring, the angle through which the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> twists, and the modulus of elasticity of the spring material in shear. <b>Torsion</b> <b>springs</b> employed industrially have been strips, rods, or bars, generally termed shafts, capabable of being flexed by twisting their axes. They rely on the variations in shearing forces to furnish an internal restoring torque. In the <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> herein the restoring torque is external and therefore independent of the shearing modulus of elasticity of the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> shaft.

5000|$|A torsion {{pendulum}} clock, or torsion clock (also known as 400-day or anniversary clock), is a mechanical clock which keeps {{time with a}} mechanism called a {{torsion pendulum}}. This is a weighted disk or wheel, often a decorative wheel with 3 or 4 chrome balls on ornate spokes, suspended by a thin wire or ribbon called a <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> (also known as [...] "suspension spring"). The torsion pendulum rotates about the vertical axis of the wire, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary pendulum. The force of the twisting <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> reverses the direction of rotation, so the torsion pendulum oscillates slowly, clockwise and counterclockwise. The clock's gears apply a pulse of torque {{to the top of}} the <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> with each rotation to keep the wheel going. The wheel and <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> function similarly to a watch's balance wheel and hairspring, as a harmonic oscillator to control the rate of the clock's hands.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simplified method {{to analyze and}} design a bistable pinned-pinned arch with <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> at the pin (revolute) joints. Finite, but not zero, values of <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> constants offer the dual advantage of being amenable to monolithic compliant bistable arches wherein <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> are realized with equivalent revolute flexures; and giving enhanced range of travel between the stable states and reduced switching forces. However, the equilibrium equations become intractable for analytical solution unlike the extreme cases of fixed-fixed and pinned-pinned arches. Therefore, a new method for analyzing and designing novel bistable arches is presented here by determining critical points in the force-displacement curve. First, the equilibrium equations for post-buckling analysis are derived by writing the deflected profile as a linear combination of the buckling mode shapes of the corresponding straight beam with <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> at the pinned ends. These equations are then used to find the critical points with maximum, minimum, and zero forces. The critical points not only provide an approximate view of the bistable force-displacement curve but also enable synthesis of arches with desired behaviour. By using this semi-analytical method, we present {{an example of an}} arch with reduced switching force, large switch-back force, and enhanced travel between the two stable states...|$|R

40|$|Two sets of movable lug {{wheel with}} spring {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested.

Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable lug wheel had a better traction performance than the fixed lug wheel. The average wheel slip of the movable lug wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the fixed lug wheel was 20. 89 %.

50|$|A <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> is {{a spring}} that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a {{flexible}} elastic object that stores mechanical energy {{when it is}} twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical <b>torsion</b> <b>spring,</b> is a metal rod or wire {{in the shape of}} a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical <b>torsion</b> <b>spring</b> the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.|$|R

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based algorithm was developed for finding the energy optimal trajectory during gait by comparing all the possible trajectories. It is first proved that addition of <b>torsion</b> <b>springs</b> at the joints lead to reduction of energy consumption as compared to a biped with no springs. All the gait parameters were then optimized to get the optimum values for the spring constants at each joint, reference angle of springs and length of each step.
