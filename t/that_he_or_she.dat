5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{requirements}} are imposed by Article V, Section I, paragraph 10 {{of the state}} constitution, which provides that the lieutenant governor be appointed as a head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration, with the exception <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> cannot be the state's attorney general. The current lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, serves as New Jersey's 33rd Secretary of State.|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers {{additional}} powers on the Minister for Home Affairs {{to prevent}} subversion. If a written law confers power on a person, body or authority to appoint people to positions, the Minister can order <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> {{be provided with}} a list of the people from which the appointment will be made, and other information. The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited. Furthermore, no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966 the Act was amended and {{narrowed to}} {{emphasize}} agents actually working with foreign powers who sought economic or political advantage by influencing governmental decision-making. The amendments shifted {{the focus of}} the law from propaganda to political lobbying and narrowed the meaning of [...] "foreign agent". From that moment on, an organization (or person) could only be placed in the FARA database if the government proved <b>that</b> it (<b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she)</b> was acting [...] "at the order, request, or under the direction or control, of a foreign principal" [...] and proved <b>that</b> it (<b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she)</b> was engaged [...] "in political activities for or in the interests of such foreign principal," [...] including by [...] "representing the interests of such foreign principal before any agency or official of the Government of the United States." ...|$|R

In addition, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is entitled to a daily allowance, free furnished residence, medical, travel and other facilities.|$|R
5|$|If the {{election}} is a non-reserved election, and the person applied for a community certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application. If the person submitted a community declaration that did not include an application for a community certificate, {{he or she must}} submit the Community Committee's written acceptance of the declaration and a statutory declaration <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not consider himself or herself a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has {{less than six months}} to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E

"The {{resolution}} {{applies only}} to children raised exclusively as Jews....A child raised simultaneously in Judaism and another religious tradition does not develop a [...] "positive and exclusive" [...] Jewish identity; therefore the presumption of Jewish status is disproved, and the resolution {{does not apply to}} <b>that</b> child. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will require conversion prior to observing bar or bat mitzvah in the synagogue." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not suffer {{from any of the}} disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest. Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> considers himself or herself {{to be a member}} of the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
50|$|Specifically named {{animals are}} {{an example of}} individuation, such as Peter Rabbit or Blob the Whale. In these instances, {{it is more likely}} <b>that</b> animate pronouns <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will be used to {{represent}} them.|$|R
50|$|Every race {{consists}} of five laps around a race track. A player {{will lose the}} race if his or her machine explodes due to either taking too much damage or landing outside of the track, gets ejected from the race due to falling to 20th place or due to completing a lap with a rank outside of the rank limit of <b>that</b> lap, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> decides to give up. In the single player Grand Prix mode, all of these conditions requires the player to use an extra machine {{if and only if}} <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has one <b>or</b> more spare machines to try again.|$|R
5000|$|If {{proceedings}} are instituted {{under the}} Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), the claimant can be [...] "a {{person who is}} aggrieved" [...] by a reviewable decision. This {{is defined as a}} person whose interests are [...] "adversely affected by the decision", and can show that the grievance which will be suffered is beyond <b>that</b> which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has as an ordinary member of the public.|$|R
5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency. The name of the voter {{will be included in}} the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore, at least 21 years old, and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> complies with the above requirements, unless the facts are shown to be otherwise.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not like. The situation {{is compounded by the}} fact that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist {{and his or her}} best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.|$|E
50|$|The Mayor (Burgemeester; Bourgmestre; Bürgermeister) is {{not only}} the head of the municipality, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is also the {{representative}} of the Regional and the Federal Government at the local level. In <b>that</b> capacity, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is responsible for the execution of laws, decrees, ordinances and orders. The Mayor is also responsible for the maintenance of public order in his <b>or</b> her municipality. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> chairs the College of Mayor and Aldermen or the Municipal College, depending on the Region, as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to learn a raga and account for all its subtleties, therefore, is to refer to compositions, which often contain a wealth of phrases that lend beauty to the raga. Before an artist {{attempts}} to sing a raga, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should be familiar with several compositions in <b>that</b> raga. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should have also listened to many different renderings of the raga by various artists, {{in order to get}} a better sense of how certain phrases can be applied.|$|R
25|$|Self-efficacy is seen {{to mediate}} {{important}} aspects of how an employee undertakes a given task, such {{as the level of}} effort and persistence. An employee with high self-efficacy is confident <b>that</b> effort <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> puts forth has a high likelihood of resulting in success. In anticipation of success, an employee is willing to put forth more effort, persist longer, remain focused on the task, seek feedback and choose more effective task strategies.|$|R
