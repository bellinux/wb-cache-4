40|$|Interval {{leaching}} long-term water-logged incubation and interval leaching long-term {{aerobic incubation}} {{were carried out}} to study the changes of different soil organic nitrogen (N) forms and their contributions <b>to</b> <b>mineralized</b> N during N-mineralization process on 10 kinds of farmland soils with markedly different {{physical and chemical properties}} on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the N-mineralization capability and capacity using the two incubation methods were evidently different. After 217 days, cumulative mineralized N, the decreased amounts of total acid-hydrolyzable N, acid-hydrolyzable ammonia N, and acid-hydrolyzable amino acid N in the water-logged incubation were about twice those in the aerobic incubation. Soluble organic N leached in the aerobic incubation was four times that in the water-logged incubation, which implied that organic N in the aerobic incubation mineralized more thoroughly than that in the water-logged incubation. The correlation analysis of the changes of soil organic N forms with crop N uptake showed that the reduced amount of total acid-hydrolyzable N in the water-logged incubation was closely associated with total N uptake by two successive-season crops (winter wheat and summer maize), and the decreased amounts of total acid-hydrolyzable N and amino acid N in the aerobic incubation were highly significantly related to the N uptake of both the first season crop (winter wheat) and successive-season maize. Multiple regression analysis, path analysis, and partial correlation analysis of the changes of soil organic N forms with mineralized N indicated that ammonia N was a main contribution <b>to</b> <b>mineralized</b> N in the water-logged incubation, whereas both acid-hydrolyzable amino acid and ammonia N were main contributions <b>to</b> <b>mineralized</b> N in the aerobic incubation.

40|$|Gelatin {{nanoparticles}} can be tuned {{with respect}} to their drug loading efficiency, degradation rate, and release kinetics, which renders these drug carriers highly suitable {{for a wide variety of}} biomedical applications. The ease of functionalization has rendered gelatin an interesting candidate material to introduce specific motifs for selective targeting to specific organs, but gelatin nanoparticles have not yet been modified to increase their affinity <b>to</b> <b>mineralized</b> tissue. By means of conjugating bone-targeting alendronate to biocompatible gelatin nanoparticles, a simple method is developed for the preparation of gelatin nanoparticles which exhibit strong affinity <b>to</b> <b>mineralized</b> surfaces. It has been shown that the degree of alendronate functionalization can be tuned by controlling the glutaraldehyde crosslinking density, the molar ratio between alendronate and glutaraldehyde, as well as the pH of the conjugation reaction. Moreover, it has been shown that the affinity of gelatin nanoparticles to calcium phosphate increases considerably upon functionalization with alendronate. In summary, gelatin nanoparticles have been developed, which exhibit great potential for use in bone-specific drug delivery and regenerative medicine...|$|R

The purpose of the increased mineralization is to protect the pulp tissue from disease, injury and trauma. Dr. Stanley also showed that the bacterial invasion of teeth could destroy the cells and cause a loss of tooth vitality. The invasion of tooth dentinal tubules by bacteria {{can be seen in the}} photograph opposite. The bacteria is present in the mouth saliva. If bacteria reaches the pulp it can cause severe inflammation called 'pulpitis'. The pulpitis is normally painful and will require endodontic treatment. This involves the removal of the pulp and the cleaning and shaping of the root canals. The faculty and staff of Nova Southeastern are preparing the extensive histological archive of Dr. Stanley for on-line use. This will enable anyone to access his archive of teeth from anywhere in the world.|$|E

Methods and Results: We inserted the mini-Tn 5 -luxAB marker into strain SRS 2 using conjugational mating. In the transconjugant mutants luciferase was produced in varying levels. The mutants showed significant differences {{in their ability to}} degrade isoproturon. One luxAB-labelled mutant maintained the ability <b>to</b> <b>mineralize</b> isoproturon and was therefore selected for monitoring colonization of barley roots. Conclusions: We successfully constructed a genetically labelled isoproturon-mineralizing-strain SRS 2 and demonstrated its ability to survive in soil and its colonization of rhizosphere.

The MCCP was able <b>to</b> <b>mineralize</b> SMZ efficiently and showed higher mineralization rates compared with the ISCP and a higher cumulative mineralization. These results lead to the assumption that the microbial community supports the degrading strain. When inoculated as isolated strain, mineralization rates were decreasing from the beginning. This indicates a lower cell activity and maybe also a reduction of cell material of the isolated strain. When inoculated as the whole soil born microbial community, the mineralization rates were increasing which indicates an increasing cell activity and probably also a growth of cells. The MCCP was, therefore, selected for the following experiment where the sustainability of the inoculation approach was tested.|$|E
