40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> free receptor (antigen/cytokine) levels rebounding {{to higher}} than the baseline level after one or more applications of an antibody drug using a target-mediated drug disposition model. Using geometry and dynamical systems analysis, we show that rebound will occur {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug-receptor product is slower than <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receptor. We also analyse <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> rebound through approximations and simulations and demonstrate that it increases if the drug dose increases or if the difference between <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug-receptor product and <b>the</b> minimum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receptor increases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is {{the result}} of <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{geographic}} range of a species with a reduction of its population size down to zero. The factors that affect biogeographic range and population size include competition, predator-prey interactions, variables of the physical environment, and chance events.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netcong Traffic Circle, {{located at}} the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 {{just north of the}} interchange with Interstate 80. The project was to produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013.|$|E

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{ice hockey}} team, American {{television}} stations needed to fill airtime and chose {{to focus on}} the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E

5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling for <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of Pentecost in 1524 {{for a solution}} to <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E
5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the air campaign in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had {{a tremendous impact on}} the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
