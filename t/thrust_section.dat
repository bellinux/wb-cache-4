40|$|We {{propose the}} {{addition}} of a new "soft-collinear" mode to soft collinear effective theory (SCET) below the usual soft scale to factorize and resum logarithms of jet radii R in jet cross sections. We consider exclusive 2 -jet cross sections in e^+e^- collisions with an energy veto Λ on additional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of energy scales whose ratio is R: the transverse momentum QR of the energetic particles inside jets and their total energy Q, and the transverse momentum Λ R of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their energy Λ. The soft-collinear mode is necessary to factorize and resum logarithms of the latter hierarchy. We show how this factorization occurs in the jet <b>thrust</b> cross <b>section</b> for cone and k_T-type algorithms at O(α_s) and using the thrust cone algorithm at O(α_s^ 2). We identify the presence of hard-collinear, in-jet soft, global (veto) soft, and soft-collinear modes in the jet <b>thrust</b> cross <b>section.</b> We also observe here that the in-jet soft modes measured with thrust are actually the "csoft" modes of the theory SCET_+. We dub the new theory with both csoft and soft-collinear modes SCET_++. We go on to explain the relation between the "unmeasured" jet function appearing in total exclusive jet cross sections and the hard-collinear and csoft functions in measured jet <b>thrust</b> cross <b>sections.</b> We do not resum logs that are non-global in origin, arising from the ratio of the scales of soft radiation whose thrust is measured at Qτ/R and of the soft-collinear radiation at 2 Λ R. Their resummation would require the introduction of additional operators beyond those we consider here. The steps we outline here are a necessary part of summing logs of R that are global in nature and have not been factorized and resummed beyond leading-log level previously.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} utilizing a three-blade, 10 -foot- diameter, supersonic-ty-pe propeller to determine propeller flutter characteristics. The particular flutter characteristics of interest were (1) the effect of stall flutter on a propeller operating in positive and negative thrust, (2) the effect of stall flutter on a propeller operating with the thrust axis inclined, and (3) the variation of vibratory blade shear stresses as the stall flutter boundary is penetrated and exceeded. Thrust and power measurements were made for all test conditions. Wake and inflow surveys were made when appropriate, to define the thrust and torque distributions and {{the magnitude of the}} inflow velocity. Stress measurements were made simultaneously to obtain the propeller flutter and bending response. It was found when operating both in the positive and negative thrust regions that, for most cases after the onset of flutter, the magnitude of the flutter stresses at first increased rapidly with section blade angle P, after which further increases in 0 resulted in only a moderate increase or a reduction in stress. Thrust-axis inclination up to the limit of the tests (angle of attack of 15 deg and dynamic pressure of 40 psf) appeared to have no effect on stall flutter. The stall flutter stresses were found to be directly associated with the <b>section</b> <b>thrust</b> characteristics of the blades. The onset of flutter was found to occur simultaneously with the divergence of the <b>section</b> <b>thrust</b> variation with blade angle from linearity for stations outboard of the blade 0. 8 -radius station. The maximum flutter stresses appeared to be a function of the maximum <b>section</b> <b>thrust</b> obtained at or {{in the vicinity of the}} blade 0. 8 -radius station. In an attempt to correlate two-dimensional airfoil data with three-dimensional data to predict the stall angle of attack (divergence of the <b>section</b> <b>thrust)</b> of the blade sections, it was found that no consistent correlation could be obtained. Also, a knowledge of the inflow conditions appeared to be insufficient to account for differences in airfoil characteristics between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{workshop}} was to develop technical background facts necessary for planning continued {{research and development of}} Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). EGS are geothermal reservoirs that require improvement of their permeability or fluid contents in order to achieve economic energy production. The initial focus of this R&D program is devising and testing means to extract additional economic energy from marginal volumes of hydrothermal reservoirs that are already producing commercial energy. By mid- 1999, the evolution of the EGS R&D Program, begun in FY 1988 by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), reached the stage where considerable expertise had to be brought to bear on what technical goals should be pursued. The main {{purpose of this}} Workshop was to do that. The Workshop was sponsored by the Office of Geothermal Technologies of the Department of Energy. Its purpose and timing were endorsed by the EGS National Coordinating Committee, through which the EGS R&D Program receives guidance from members of the U. S. geothermal industry. Section 1. 0 of this report documents the EGS R&D Program Review Session. There, managers and researchers described the goals and activities of the program. Recent experience with injection at The Geysers and analysis of downhole conditions at Dixie Valley highlighted this session. Section 2. 0 contains a number of technical presentations that were invited or volunteered to illuminate important technical and economic facts and opportunities for research. The emphasis here was on fi. acture creation, detection, and analysis. Section 3. 0 documents the initial general discussions of the participants. Important topics that emerged were: Specificity of defined projects, Optimizing cost effectiveness, Main technical areas to work on, Overlaps between EGS and Reservoir Technology R&D areas, Relationship of microseismic events to hydraulic fractures, and Defining criteria for prioritizing research <b>thrusts.</b> <b>Sections</b> 4. 0 and 5. 0 report the meat of the Workshop.

50|$|The final Atlas E test from CCAS was Missile 40E on February 13, 1962. With OSTF-1 back in operation, Missile 66E {{launched}} on March 1. Shortly after liftoff, a <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> fire {{started in the}} vicinity of the fuel fill/drain valve. It continued until approximately T+50 seconds and then disappeared, but apparently resulted in damage to the <b>thrust</b> <b>section,</b> as the helium control gas leaked and resulted in vernier engine shutdown as well as no booster jettison. After BECO, the sustainer engine was left dragging the dead weight of the booster section. This combined with the loss of roll control from vernier shutdown caused the missile to tumble and finally break up at T+295 seconds. The exact reason for the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> fire was not determined. In addition, an erroneous signal from a pad umbilical threw open the LOX boil-off valve at liftoff, causing a gradual decay in tank pressure during ascent, although this was a secondary failure that did not contribute to the eventual loss of the missile.|$|E
50|$|With this {{string of}} {{successful}} Atlas tests, program officials were lulled into {{a sense of}} security that rudely ended on March 11, 1960 when Atlas 51D lifted from LC-13. The B-1 engine suffered combustion instability which caused loss of thrust within two seconds of liftoff. At T+3 seconds, the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> exploded, followed by structural failure of the propellant tanks, causing the Atlas to fall back onto LC-13 in an enormous fireball. The Atlas went in for a repeat performance on April 8 when Missile 48D, launched from LC-11 and intended as the first closed-loop test of the AIG (All Inertial Guidance System), experienced combustion instability again, this time in the B-2 engine. The first indication of trouble was a pressure surge in the B-2 combustion chamber, followed by unstable thrust, engine shutdown, and an explosion that started a <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> fire. The B-1 engine then shut down, followed by the sustainer and verniers. Since the propulsion system had not attained sufficient thrust, the launcher hold-down mechanism did not release the missile, which stayed in place and burned on the pad. The <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> fire slowed down 15 seconds after the attempted launch, then resumed around 45 seconds. At 60 seconds, the Atlas was completely destroyed when the propellant tanks exploded.|$|E

Although engine operation was generally satisfactory, telemetry data indicated significant leakage of liquid hydrogen in the <b>thrust</b> <b>section.</b> However, {{it was not possible to}} determine the location of the leak with certainty, so program directors decided on a second PFRF with added telemetry probes. It was known that during the test run on December 18, that recirculated exhaust gases and vibration leaked into the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> and this was considered a potential cause of the leak.

50|$|Atlas 90D, {{the final}} R&D flight of a D-series missile, {{launched}} successfully from LC-12 on January 23, 1961. Four operational Atlas D flights from VAFB {{during the year}} were successful and the first three flights of 1962 also went without a hitch. Atlas 52D launched from 576-B3 at VAFB on February 21, 1962. Abnormal <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> temperatures occurred early in the flight, and the sustainer and verniers shut down starting at T+47 seconds. The booster engines shut down at T+68 seconds, and the missile broke up four seconds later. This failure was traced to a leak in the booster engine gas generator that caused <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> overheating and loss of engine thrust, and it occurred a mere five hours after John Glenn's Mercury launch, driving home the point that Atlas was still far from a reliable vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Two years later, another {{attempted}} {{launch of}} an Intelsat communications satellite took place 30 September 1977 on AC-43. Shortly after liftoff, abnormal temperatures were {{detected in the}} Atlas's <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> and continued to rise as the booster ascended. At T+33 seconds, a fire broke out, causing control of the vehicle to gradually fail. At T+55 seconds, the sustainer engine shut down and the Atlas pitched over, causing the entire launch vehicle to disintegrate from structural loads. The payload fairing and satellite were stripped from the booster, followed by the Atlas exploding as the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> fire touched off the propellant tanks. The Centaur was ejected and flew free until Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+60 seconds. NASA and Air Force officials, already busy investigating the launch failure of a Delta booster three weeks earlier, dredged the Atlas's engines from the ocean floor {{and sent them to}} Convair for examination. It was concluded that a gas generator leak caused by improper brazing of a pipe led to overheating and fire in the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> of the Atlas. The pipe also suffered corrosion from six years of sitting in a warehouse in the salty air along the Florida coast and the damage was in an area not visible during preflight examination. The Atlas used on this flight had been delivered to the Cape in 1971 and kept in storage since then, an unusually long time. In the aftermath of the accident, NASA inspected their inventory of Atlas vehicles and found several more improperly brazed pipes which needed replacement.|$|E

50|$|On September 25, Missile 6A was launched. Aside {{from more}} {{instrumentation}} in the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> and the above-mentioned helium vent modification, it was identical to 4A and predictably met {{the same fate}} as once again, the <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> overheated. Thrust levels in both engines dropped to only 35% at T+32 seconds and two seconds later, the propulsion system completely shut down. The Range Safety destruct command was sent at T+63 seconds. This time, overheating and high vibration levels had caused a LOX regulator to fail, resulting in gas generator flameout. After this debacle, the Air Force relented and accepted {{the need for an}} improved heat shield. Other modifications were made as well, including removal of the long skirt covering the boattail and engine nozzles. The gas generator vent pipe was changed to point outward and away from the missile instead of directly underneath it. The engine nozzles were covered with fiberglass insulation boots and aluminum plumbing in the Atlas changed to steel plumbing which had a greater heat tolerance. The autopilot was also modified to reduce vibration levels.|$|E

40|$|In hard {{collisions}} at a hadron collider {{the most}} appropriate description of the initial state depends on what is measured in the final state. Parton distribution functions (PDFs) evolved to the hard collision scale Q are appropriate for inclusive observables, but not for measurements with a specific number of hard jets, leptons, and photons. Here the incoming protons are probed and lose their identity to an incoming jet at a scale μ_B << Q, and the initial state is described by universal beam functions. We discuss the field-theoretic treatment of beam functions, and show that the beam function has the same RG evolution as the jet function to all orders in perturbation theory. In contrast to PDF evolution, the beam function evolution does not mix quarks and gluons and changes the virtuality of the colliding parton at fixed momentum fraction. At μ_B, the incoming jet can be described perturbatively, and we give a detailed derivation of the one-loop matching of the quark beam function onto quark and gluon PDFs.

Recovery of the film capsule was successful. Overall performance of 11C was quite good, the sustainer HS valve malfunctioned and resulted in reduced LOX flow to the engine, this resulted in low sustainer thrust and complete fuel depletion by SECO, and it was suspected that a leak in a LOX duct had affected the HS valve.

50|$|Vernier {{thrusters}} {{are used}} in rockets such as the R-7 for vehicle maneuvering because the main engine is fixed in place. For the Atlas rocket family, in addition to maneuvering, the verniers were used for roll control, although the booster engines could also perform this function.

50|$|After {{the high}} degree of success {{achieved}} in 1962, the flight record of the D-series took {{a turn for the worse}} in 1963. The first flight of the year, Missile 39D, went awry when high <b>thrust</b> <b>section</b> temperatures caused total propulsion system failure two minutes into launch. The malfunction was traced to the sustainer insulation boot breaking off at liftoff, which allowed exhaust gases to recirculate in the <b>thrust</b> <b>section.</b> Three Atlas Ds then successfully tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On March 10, Atlas 102D was launched on an operational test from 576-B3. The missile began to tumble out of control shortly after liftoff and self-destructed at T+33 seconds, showering the area around the pad with flaming debris. Investigation of the failure found that the pitch gyro spin motor was either not running or the rotation speed was too low, and that 102D was still using the old Type B gyro canisters which did not have the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System (SMRD). The SMRD had been conceived back in 1958 after the first Atlas B failed in flight due to an inoperative yaw gyro, but was not phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961. Missile 102D had not been upgraded to the newer Type D gyros which had the SMRD, and a quick examination of the Atlas inventory at VAFB found two more missiles with Type B gyros. They were replaced with spare Type D canisters from Project Mercury.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of a cascade within a cold stream thrust {{reverser}} during the early, conceptual stage of the product development process. A reliable procedure is developed for the exchange of geometric and load data between a two dimensional aerodynamic model and a three dimensional structural model. Aerodynamic and structural simulations are carried out using realistic operating conditions, for three different design configurations with a view to minimising weight for equivalent or improved aerodynamic and structural performance. For normal operational conditions the simulations show that total reverse thrust is unaffected when the performance of the deformed vanes is compared to the un-deformed case. This shows that for the conditions tested, the minimal deformation of the cascade vanes has no significant affect on aerodynamic efficiency and that there is scope for reducing the weight of the cascade. The pressure distribution through a two dimensional <b>thrust</b> reverser <b>section</b> is determined for two additional cascade vane configurations and it is shown that with a small decrease in total reverse thrust, it is possible to reduce weight and eliminate supersonic flow regimes through the nacelle section. By increasing vane sections in high pressure areas and decreasing sections in low pressure areas the structural performance of the cascade vanes in the weight reduced designs, is improved with significantly reduced levels of vane displacement and stress...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The Scandinavian Caledonides {{provide a}} well-exposed {{example of a}} deeply eroded orogen. The pre-erosion thrust front is located much farther to the E than {{previously}} supposed, the only true autochthon being S of Oslo. The external zone of the orogen {{is divided into three}} series of thrust sheets; the Baltic Cover Sheets, the Crystalline Thrust Sheets and the Oceanic Thrust Sheets. The three thrust sheet complexes are d rived from widely different provenances but display all the characteristics of a classic fold and <b>thrust</b> belt. <b>Sections</b> through the external zone can be balanced and restored, indicating large amounts of translation south-eastwards onto the Baltic Craton. The internal zone is composed of a number of tectonostrati-graphic disparate units which display a ductile style of deformation. Sections through the internal zone are not restorable and assemblage in a large-scale shear zone is proposed, followed by thrusting onto the Baltic Craton. Deformation i the orogen occurred throughout a period of [...] 100 Ma starting in the Late Cambrian. Thrust vectors for the orogen display rotation with time and are generally oblique to the Caledonian Front; within the internal zone stretching lineations are parallel to orogenic strike. A collision model for the orogen includes two W-dipping subduction z es, oblique collision producing shear parallel to the orogen and oblique thrust-sheet motions culminating in the large-scale underthrusting of the Laurentian Craton by the Baltic Craton. The Caledonian Orogen in Scandinavia, which formed by the collision of the Laurentia...|$|R
40|$|Loft is an {{automated}} mesh generation code {{that is designed}} for aerospace vehicle structures. From user input, Loft generates meshes for wings, noses, tanks, fuselage <b>sections,</b> <b>thrust</b> structures, and so on. As a mesh is generated, each element is assigned properties to mark {{the part of the}} vehicle with which it is associated. This property assignment is an extremely powerful feature that enables detailed analysis tasks, such as load application and structural sizing. This report is presented in two parts. The first part is an overview of the code and its applications. The modeling approach that was used to create the finite element meshes is described. Several applications of the code are demonstrated, including a Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) wing-sizing study, a lunar lander stage study, a launch vehicle shroud shape study, and a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) orbiter. Part two of the report is the program user manual. The manual includes in-depth tutorials and a complete command reference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} design, development and analysis of propeller by using a bamboo composite fibre material with contra rotating advance airboat propellers, airboat propeller shows characteristics of its non-aviation usage. The design of a propeller is broad, flattened blade and squared-off tips because the aerodynamic favors a high drag that is useful for slowing an airboat. A simple method of predicting the performance of a propeller is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the propeller is divided into a number of independent sections along the length. At each section a force balance is applied involving 2 D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced by the section. At the same time a balance of axial and angular momentum is applied. This produces a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of <b>section</b> <b>thrust</b> and torque can be summed to predict the overall performance of the propeller...|$|R
