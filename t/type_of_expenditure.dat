5000|$|In {{the fourth}} {{book of the}} Nicomachean Ethics, magnificence is {{described}} as the ethical virtue linked to money: [...] "it is a fitting expenditure involving largeness of scale" [...] (IV, 2, 1122a 23). However, Aristotle insists that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> must be appropriate to the circumstance. Hence, not every type of action requires {{the same degree of}} expense. Thus, Aristotle, like Plato, consolidates the separation of the virtues of magnificence and magnanimity. Drawing on Xenophon, however, he dignifies the economic aspect of a great expenditure by turning it into an ethical virtue.|$|E
50|$|With Aristotle, magnificence also acquires an {{aesthetic}} dimension. It becomes an art in itself, requiring that one understands what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is needed and does so tastefully. A magnificent man {{knows that the}} expenditure should be large, but appropriate to who is actually spending, the circumstance, and {{the object of the}} expense. The Aristotle scholar W. D. Ross suggested that in this conception magnificence turns out to be mainly a matter of aesthetic good taste. The aesthetic role that magnificence acquired with Aristotle exerted a profound influence on rhetoric, the arts, architecture and art criticism.|$|E

50|$|Retail leakage {{occurs when}} local people are {{spending}} more for goods, than local businesses actually acquire. Retail sales leakage occurs when there is unsatisfied demand within the trading area and that the locality should provide extra stores spaces for such type of businesses. After all, retail leakage does not necessarily translate into opportunity. For instance, {{there could be a}} tough competition in a nearby locality that leads the market for same type of product. Many small - to medium-sized communities experience leakage of retail expenditures as local citizens drive to neighboring towns to shop at national retail chains (e.g. Tesco, Asda) or eat at national restaurant chains (e.g. Slug and Lettuce, Harvester). Attracting such national retail chain stores and restaurants to a community can prevent this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> leakage and create local jobs.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, in 1965 {{when the}} fourth plan was being thought of, the states demanded {{for a set}} of firm {{objective}} criteria for the distribution of central assistance. The planning commission left it on the states to decide on the criteria. But no agreement was reached in the National Development Council (NDC). Thus, the planning commission thought of an award system, where the finance commission had the discretion to award states in times of need after a proper scrutiny of their situation. In 1968, Planning Commission induced the state governments to come to an agreement. The system of varying proportions of grants and loans from scheme to scheme was abolished. Central assistance to states was now given uniformly in blocks. Each state got 70% loans and 30% grants. There was no special manoeuvrability and therefore no special advantage {{on the part of the}} bigger states. This type of settlement also faced problems because of the artificial division between the plan and the non-plan expenditures. The former <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> was to be looked after by the finance commission awards and the latter by central assistance given by either NDC or the Planning Commission. The loan part which was given to the state had gotten accumulated and for some of the states the loan obligation and repayments were bigger than the assistance they got. In 1969, after the draft the fourth five-year plan was presented, the Planning Commission officially discussed with the states the impact of the Finance Commission Awards on their finances. Great variations in the provision of these awards were witnessed amongst the states. Some states had a substantial surplus and other states could not even meet their budgetary responsibilities.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} state-by-state totals {{of medical}} expenditures attributable to cigarette smoking for calendar year 1993. METHODS: The smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) of total state medical expenditures, by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> were estimated using a national model {{that describes the}} relationship between smoking and medical expenditures, controlling {{for a variety of}} sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors. Employing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the authors used the national model to estimate SAFs for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, then applied these SAFs to published state medical expenditures, by type of expenditures, to estimate total 1993 state medical expenditures attributable to smoking. National estimates are the sums of state estimates. RESULTS: In 1993, the estimated proportion of total medical expenditures attributable to smoking for the U. S. as a whole was 11. 8 %, with a range across states from 6. 6 % to 14. 1 %. By <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> SAFs ranged from a low of 8. 0 % for home health expenditures to a high of 15. 9 % for nursing home expenditures for the nation as a whole. Total U. S. medical expenditures attributable to smoking amounted to an estimated $ 72. 7 billion in 1993 (95 % interval estimate $ 48. 0 -$ 97. 4 billion). Estimates of total smoking-attributable state medical expenditures (SAEs) ranged from $ 79. 6 million to $ 8. 72 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking accounted for a substantial portion of state and national medical expenditures in 1993, with considerable variation among states. The range across states was due to differences in smoking prevalence, health status, other socioeconomic variables used in the model, and the magnitude and patterns of state medical expenditures...|$|E

Biological, demographic, and policy factors determine each age group's share of health spending. Public funds financed over three-fifths of the health ex-penses of the aged, with Medicare and Medicaid together ac-counting for 58 percent. Most of the health expenses of the young age groups were paid by private sources. Expenditures for medical care differ markedly with age.
