[...] Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. [...] When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied [...] "I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>there</b> were so many [...] [...] It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk." [...] By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. [...] She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as [...] "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henri Cartier-Bresson said of Griffiths' [...] "Not since Goya {{has anyone}} portrayed war like Philip Jones Griffiths." [...] The South Vietnamese president, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, criticised Griffiths' work, {{remarking}} [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>there</b> {{are many people}} I don't want back in my country, but I can assure you Mr. Griffiths name {{is at the top}} of the list." ...|$|E

In {{compliance}} with one of Gwyn's final requests, Thomas Tenison, the Archbishop of Canterbury, preached a sermon on 17 December from the text of Luke 15:7 [...] "Just so, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>there</b> will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance." [...] Her will and codicil were proved on 7 December 1687.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's all right, sir. I {{can keep}} my mouth shut, though I might as well <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>there's</b> some pretty tales about you {{drifting}} around the beach right now." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>there</b> have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
