25|$|In the Tyrrhenian Greek cities, the {{violence}} raging inland, {{between them and}} their fellow Greeks on toe and heel, fostered the circumstances of de facto independence. Naples, in particular, {{had a history of}} differences with Byzantium and had in the past sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>herself</b> dependent on other authorities, often papal. In 801, the Byzantine patrician of Sicily succeeded in creating Anthimus duke. However, Anthimus was unable to control the cities under his rule, Gaeta and Amalfi. Subsequent to Anthimus, the patrician tried to appoint his own candidate without imperial approval. The people rebelled and accepted Stephen III in 821. During Stephen's decade of rule, Naples severed all legal ties to Constantinople and even began minting her own coins. In 840, after a brief flirtation with Frankish servitude, to Lothair I, and a Frankish duke, in the person of Duke Contard, the Neapolitan citizenry elected Sergius I their magister militum. Sergius established a dynasty, the Sergi, that was to rule the duchy for the next three hundred years.|$|E
25|$|According to Xuazang, the {{introduction}} of sericulture to Khotan occurred {{in the first quarter}} of the 5th century. The King of Khotan wanted to obtain silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds and Chinese know-how - the three crucial components of silk production. The Chinese court had strict rules against these items leaving China, to maintain the Chinese monopoly on silk manufacture. Xuanzang wrote that the King of Khotan asked for the hand of a Chinese princess in marriage as a token of his allegiance to the Chinese emperor. The request was granted, and an ambassador was sent to the Chinese court to escort the Chinese princess to Khotan. He advised the princess that she would need to bring silkworms and mulberry seeds in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>herself</b> robes in Khotan and to make the people prosperous. The princess concealed silkworm eggs and mulberry seeds in her headdress and smuggled them through the Chinese frontier. According to his text, silkworm eggs, mulberry trees and weaving techniques passed from Khotan to India, and from there eventually reached Europe.|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Anne Jäckel {{describes the}} story as dealing with [...] "the slow descent into Hell of two honest, liberal people." [...] The two persons are the short and monocled Captain Dumitriu and his sophisticated wife. Confronted with the general's spiteful decision, they find themselves isolated to a garrison in a land frequently raided by Macedonian komitadji, in rebellion against Romanian rule. Initially shocked by the cultural clash, Von Debretsy, a mother of three, attempts to adapt her aristocratic lifestyle to the new requirements, but manages <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>herself</b> stand out when she continues to seek a life of luxury. French critic Sylvie Rollet argues that this attempt to [...] "tame the world" [...] by erecting [...] "frontiers" [...] is a central aspect of An Unforgettable Summer.|$|E
500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>herself</b> heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk with her eyes closed, which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] when she had to trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>herself</b> more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E
