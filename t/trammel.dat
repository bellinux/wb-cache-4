5|$|Benton, Bauer and {{the boys}} are spotted by Iké's helicopter. While they flee into the forest, Benton steps on a land mine. With little time to disarm it, Benton urges Bauer to leave, so he can buy time. When he is {{surrounded}} by Iké and his men, Benton takes his foot off the trigger and detonates the mine, killing himself and the rebels, though Iké survives. Bauer and the children continue to the capital, where he defeats another rebel ambush. At {{the gates of the}} embassy, <b>Trammel</b> denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children's safety. He reluctantly accepts, thus sacrificing his freedom. While Taylor is inaugurated President, Bauer and the children evacuate, leaving chaotic Sangala behind.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, <b>trammel</b> nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, <b>trammel</b> nets, and bottom longlines; it has little economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E

40|$|Trammelnets are {{sometimes}} considered as harmful gears for coastal reef resources and their banning has been recommended in the Caribbean. In {{the present state}} of the fishing technologies and strategies used in Martinique, <b>trammels</b> are more species selective than Antillean wire traps because they target mainly spiny lobsters and their fishing time is shorter. Furthermore, the <b>trammels</b> catch finfish at a much larger size than traps of the most common mesh sizes, including the mesh sizes recommended as optimal; however, no obvious differences were found between traps and <b>trammels</b> in their selectivity for lobsters. Therefore, the <b>trammels</b> are not more destructive than the widely accepted wire traps, at least as long as the reef fishery targets medium-sized fish {{at the expense of the}} larger species. The main drawback of <b>trammels</b> is the waste of spoiled fish. An optimal use of this gear could be fishing for lobsters with a net of low height and possibly larger mesh size.

In 1936, the community had a row of dwellings, one business, and five farm units. Although <b>Trammels</b> appeared on county maps, population statistics were never recorded. A portion of the town is covered by a small man-madelake. The remaining areas of <b>Trammels</b> became a part of the DeWalt community. As of 2008 what was <b>Trammels</b> is now in the city limits of Missouri City.|$|R
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the <b>trammel</b> dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and <b>trammel</b> nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|E
5|$|While Bauer {{performs}} {{missionary work}} at the Okavango school in Sangala owned by Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), U.S. embassy official Frank <b>Trammel</b> (Gil Bellows) serves him a subpoena {{to appear before the}} Senate regarding torture charges, but Bauer refuses to go. Upon hearing the embassy will cut funding to Benton's school if it continues to protect him, he decides to leave. Meanwhile, several children playing soccer are ambushed by Juma's rebel soldiers and kidnapped for conscription. When two boys run away, the soldiers open fire, killing one. Benton learns that the rebels are planning to attack his school. He calls Bauer, who hides the children in an underground shelter, and kills several rebels before getting captured and tortured. Benton is able to ambush the remaining soldiers, and Bauer kills the leader, Youssou Dubaku (Zolile Nokwe). His brother, Iké (Hakeem Kae-Kazim) hears of his death and plots revenge, while Bauer and Benton leave with the children to get to the American embassy in the capital before the final helicopter evacuates the country.|$|E

25|$|Large {{numbers of}} pale-edged {{stingrays}} are caught incidentally in bottom trawls and <b>trammel</b> nets, {{particularly in the}} Gulf of Thailand, the Java Sea, and off the Indian coast. Most individuals landed are retained for human consumption, although {{the small size of}} this species limits its economic significance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pale-edged stingray as Near Threatened and notes that it is approaching the criteria for Vulnerable. Across most of its range, this species experiences heavy and increasing fishing pressure, with all size classes susceptible to capture.|$|E
500|$|Common {{stingrays}} {{are caught}} incidentally by commercial fisheries across {{many parts of}} its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom longlines, beach seines, and <b>trammel</b> nets. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this ray is more susceptible to small-scale coastal fisheries than to industrial operations, {{such as in the}} Balearic Islands, where it makes up 40% of the shark and ray <b>trammel</b> net catch. Surveys indicate that common stingrays have declined in the Mediterranean and the northeastern Atlantic, and may have been extirpated from the Bay of Biscay. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened in those two regions, while the species as a whole is listed under Data Deficient. The common stingray is protected within five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Balearic Islands, and also benefits from a European Union ban on the use of trawls within [...] of the coast.|$|E
500|$|S.latus is edible, {{but it is}} a {{relatively}} rare species, and is therefore of little interest to fisheries.

500|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of this ray it is very common {{to be found in}} pet trade, many people ignore the fact that in total maturity the size of the ray exceeds the capacity of many household aquariums. The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets, but inexpensive due to its small size. It is caught in mass in bottom trawl, <b>trammel,</b> and fish traps. The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately [...] long.
