5|$|Despite limited <b>training</b> <b>time</b> {{on floor}} and vault {{in the summer}} of 2007, Liukin opted to compete {{all-around}} at the 2007 U.S. National Championships. She posted the highest score of the entire meet on bars and the second highest score on beam {{on the second day of}} competition, winning the senior bars title for the third year in a row and placing second on beam. However, she also suffered several falls and errors on floor and vault, and finished in third place overall, more than five points behind Shawn Johnson, the all-around gold medalist.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} season, Lysacek dealt with several injuries, {{including}} broken ribs, {{which resulted in}} lost <b>training</b> <b>time.</b> After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States Figure Skating Association cancelled the 2001–2002 ISU Junior Grand Prix event {{to be held in}} Arizona and did not allow its junior skaters to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit for the rest of that season. At the 2002 U.S. Championships, Lysacek repeated his 12th-place finish from the previous year and was not selected for the team to the 2002 World Junior Championships. He was sent to the 2002 Triglav Trophy in April, where he won the gold medal on the junior level.|$|E
5|$|The venue was confiscated by the German {{occupation}} forces during World War II, {{who built}} a {{cold storage facility}} south of the pitch. In 1945, {{after five years of}} occupation, the pitch was in a detrimental state. The stadium received a major renovation, including a new pitch and replacing half the wooden terraces with concrete stands. The cold facility was converted to a club house and a basement was dug out and used as a changing room. In 1946, parts of Vang, including Briskebyen, were amalgamated with Hamar. The same year, Hamar Municipality signed an agreement with the club whereby municipal subsidies would cover the operating costs in exchange for the club allocating <b>training</b> <b>time</b> to other clubs.|$|E

5|$|Between {{this action}} and February 19, 1945, Davis flew another 47 missions, most escorting bombers or ships, in {{addition}} to a few ground-attack missions, but saw little or no aerial combat in that time. On February 19, he was withdrawn from the front to begin certification on the P-51 Mustang, logging 45 hours of <b>training</b> <b>time</b> on the aircraft through the end of March. He returned to combat duty only briefly in April, flying in three combat missions as a copilot aboard a B-25 Mitchell bomber. On May 3, 1945, he was reassigned to Goodfellow Field at San Angelo, Texas, helping to train new pilots and serving as an operations officer for the base {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no <b>training</b> <b>time.</b> NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|After the games, Evans {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. He twisted his ankle later in Perth and missed some <b>training</b> <b>time.</b> He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of {{more and more}} American fighters downing the Luftwaffe's best fighter pilots had begun a vicious circle. In order to meet frontline requirements, <b>training</b> <b>time</b> was cut.

25|$|In pre-war establishments, and {{up until}} 1942 the German {{training}} programs had proven better {{in terms of}} <b>training</b> <b>time</b> given to pilots than the Allies. However, German <b>training</b> <b>time</b> reduced through the war, while Allied training improved. The decrease in skill and training {{was caused by the}} attrition rates of pilots and skilled aircrew. This was perhaps the most important aspect in the decline of the Luftwaffe as an effective fighting force. The rise in attrition caused a steady decline in skills and experience forced the Germans to curtail training programs to fill empty cockpits. Owing to this, new pilots with less skill than their predecessors were lost at a faster rate. The increasing losses, in turn, forced the training establishments to produce pilots even more rapidly. Once this cycle began, it was difficult to escape. One of the key indicators in the decline of German fighter pilot skill after 1940 air battles was the rise of losses owing to non-combat causes. By the first half of 1943 losses sustained in accidents were as many as losses in combat.|$|E
25|$|The {{special case}} of linear support vector {{machines}} {{can be solved}} more efficiently by {{the same kind of}} algorithms used to optimize its close cousin, logistic regression; this class of algorithms includes sub-gradient descent (e.g., PEGASOS) and coordinate descent (e.g., LIBLINEAR). LIBLINEAR has some attractive <b>training</b> <b>time</b> properties. Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data and the iterations also have a Q-Linear Convergence property, making the algorithm extremely fast.|$|E

At the end of the training they took the TTB final test. In addition, the participants were asked to recognize ten MG shade tabs in a blind manner before and after TTB <b>training.</b> The <b>training</b> <b>times</b> and percentages of correct answers were compared using the paired t-test. Variations in scores with <b>training</b> <b>times</b> and percentages of correct answers before and after training were compared using the ANOVA test. <b>Training</b> <b>times</b> between thirty-one and thirty-eight minutes provided a significantly higher mean score than <b>training</b> <b>times</b> of over thirty-eight minutes (p= 0. 036). The percentage of correct answers obtained with the MG before and after training shows a positive correlation. High TTB scores are associated with a greater number of correct answers in MG shade tab selection...|$|R

The Armidales are longer and heavier than their Fremantle-class predecessors, with improved seakeeping ability and increased range, allowing them to reach Australia's offshore territories. The ships are multi-crewed, with three ship's companies available for every two vessels, allowing the patrol boats {{to spend more time}} at sea without cutting into sailors' rest or <b>training</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{the story}} of {{resuscitation}} does not stop in the early 1970s. Major advances have continued. In 1980 the first program to train EMTs to perform defibrillation began in King County, Washington, and similar programs spread throughout the United States. This training required 10hours, {{and in the first}} demonstration project, survival from ventricular fibrillation increased from 7% to 26%. In 1984 the first program with fire fighter EMTs using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) also began in King County, Washington. The use of AEDs simplified the training of EMTs and thus allowed the procedure to spread more rapidly throughout communities. Automated external defibrillators require considerably less <b>training</b> <b>time</b> compared to manual defibrillators since the EMT does not have to interpret the cardiac rhythm.|$|E

25|$|Soviet {{training}} left {{much to be}} desired. Stalin’s purges had deprived the VVS of its {{senior and}} best commanders. It heralded a debilitating decline in military effectiveness. In the event of the Winter War and the German victory in the French Campaign, the Soviet leadership panicked and Stalin ordered a hasty overhaul of the armed forces. Order 0362, 22 December 1940, of the People’s Commissar Defence ordered the accelerated training program for pilots which meant the cutting of <b>training</b> <b>time.</b> The program had already been cut owing to an earlier defence order, 008, dated 14 March 1940. It {{put an end to}} the flight training for volunteers, and instituted mass drafts. In February 1941, pilot training was cut further leading to a disastrous drop in the quality of pilot training prior to Barbarossa.|$|E
25|$|Hanyu began skating {{at the age}} of four, {{following}} his older sister to the rink. His figure skating idol growing up was Evgeni Plushenko.

25|$|In {{response}} to foreign threats the Ottoman government chose to rapidly expand {{the size of}} the corps after the 1570s. Janissaries spent shorter periods of time in training as acemi oğlans, as the average age of recruitment increased from 13.5 in the 1490s to 16.6 in 1603. This reflected not only the Ottomans' greater need for manpower, but also the shorter <b>training</b> <b>time</b> necessary to produce skilled musketeers in comparison with archers. However, this change alone was not enough to produce the necessary manpower, and consequently the traditional limitation of recruitment to boys conscripted in the devşirme was lifted. Membership was opened up to free-born Muslims, both recruits hand-picked by the commander of the Janissaries, as well as the sons of current members of the Ottoman standing army. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the devşirme had largely been abandoned as a method of recruitment.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} if the effect of longer <b>training</b> <b>times</b> (50 instead of 25 minutes per day) using a robotic device results in a better outcome of walking ability of subjects with a sub-acute motor complete (AIS B) and incomplete (AIS C) spinal cord injury (SCI). Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study whereof, 18 completed on average 34 trainings in eight weeks. Longer <b>training</b> <b>times</b> resulted in better locomotor function. The second important result of the study is that a beneficial effect can be achieved by the application of a robotic device for prolonged training sessions without requiring more personal resources. It has to remain open whether even longer <b>training</b> <b>times</b> (more than 50 min) would result in a still better outcome. In any case, the extent of possible recovery in an individual patient is determined by the level and severity of spinal cord damage...|$|R
