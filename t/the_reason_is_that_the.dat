5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E

It was important to free set theory of these paradoxes because nearly all of mathematics was being redefined in terms of set theory. In an attempt to avoid these paradoxes, set theory was axiomatized based on first-order logic, and thus axiomatic set theory was born.|$|E
25|$|When {{the land}} needs a {{subsurface}} drainage system, but saline groundwater is present at great depth, {{it is better}} to employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches instead of a deep, widely spaced system. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems.

The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E

25|$|Some {{textbooks}} mistakenly {{state that}} {{the speed of sound}} increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different levels compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> larger density of water, which works to slow sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{logarithm}} of {{the stock}} price is undergoing a random walk, so over time its probability distribution will {{get more and more}} broad and smooth (see above). (More technically, the central limit theorem says that multiplying more and more random variables will create a log-normal distribution with larger and larger variance, so eventually it covers many orders of magnitude almost uniformly.) To be sure of approximate agreement with Benford's Law, the distribution has to be approximately invariant when scaled up by any factor up to 10; a lognormally distributed data set with wide dispersion would have has this approximate property.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most {{subduction}} zones worldwide, {{there is}} no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt {{at the bottom of}} the Pacific Ocean, burying this large depression. Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench. However, as with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed like a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700.|$|E

25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not vest in his estate. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate.|$|E
25|$|Another of Einstein's notable thought {{experiments}} {{about the}} nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer performing experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant π than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.|$|E
500|$|Decompression {{time can}} be {{significantly}} shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during the decompression phase of the dive (or pure oxygen at stops in [...] of water or less). <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inert gas outgases at a rate proportional {{to the difference between}} the partial pressure of inert gas in the diver's body and its partial pressure in the breathing gas; whereas the likelihood of bubble formation depends on the difference between the inert gas partial pressure in the diver's body and the ambient pressure. Reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a nitrox mix during the dive, since less nitrogen will be taken into the body than during the same dive done on air.|$|E

However, in common with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700. However, earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are less common than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the last few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge [...] to [...] per year. This is only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kylfings {{have also}} been {{identified}} with the Votic people. Carl Christian Rafn, Edgar V. Saks, B. Briem and Sigurður Nordal have proposed Kylfings {{to have been the}} Norse name for the Votes. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ethnonym Vadja(laiset) can be associated with the word vadja (modern Estonian vai) which means [...] "stake", [...] "wedge" [...] or [...] "staff", which corresponds to Old Norse kolfr. Vadjalaiset would consequently be translated into Old East Norse as kolfingar, which in Old West Norse (Old Icelandic) would be umlauted as kylfingar. Whereas some native names were Scandinavized, as Rostov into Ráðstofa, the Norse learned of the meaning of other names and translated them, which they did at Volkhov, {{and in the case of}} some of the Dniepr rapids. The theory that the Kylfings were Votes has been opposed by Max Vasmer and Stender-Petersen, whereas Holm finds it likely. Holm considers it apparent that the Varangians and the Finnic tribes were able to cooperate well, and he points to the relative ease and stability with which Finland was later integrated as a part of the Swedish kingdom. Jorma Koivulehto, a Finnish linguist, disagrees with the Vote theory and maintains that the Votic name or any other Finnic ethnonym is not etymologically connected with the name Kylfingar.|$|E
