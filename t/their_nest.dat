5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> Sometimes, however, the males may return to <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> while mating.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> during {{the early hours of the}} day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material.|$|E
50|$|The {{saffron toucanet}} has been {{observed}} making nests beginning in October. The highest numbers of active nests were recorded in November. <b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> had a cavity depth of 20.0-68.0 cm, an entrance diameter of 4.3-7.4 cm, and a cavity height of 7.0-24.0 meters. Due to their small size, {{they do not need}} large cavities for <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> and they do not need to compete with other species for suitable spots. They prefer making <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> in living trees such as the Garapa (Apuleia leiocarpa) and the Aspidosperma australe. The diameter at breast height (DBH) was between 44-132 cm. They do not tend to reuse the same cavities for <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seaby’s {{illustrations}} are well-known to post-war British {{children through}} his watercolours for two Ladybird books on British birds by Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald: British Birds and <b>their</b> <b>Nests</b> (1953) and A Second Book of British Birds and <b>their</b> <b>Nests</b> (1954).|$|R
25|$|<b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> are {{composed}} of vertical combs made of horizontal combs forming a single form row of concentric hemispheres. Found in ground cavities, <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> are {{found to have a}} maximum diameter of 50cm with a maximum of 16,500 individuals.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> to attack and kill the intruder. Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in <b>their</b> <b>nest,</b> where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> during {{the early hours of the}} day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>nesting</b> {{is done on}} the ground, {{and they}} create <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> {{so that they will}} be hidden among rocks, roots, or tufts of grass on steeply sloping ground. <b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> are large and shallow, {{constructed}} of strips of bark, plant fibers, leaves, and grass. The female will lay 3 or 4 white to cream-colored eggs that are speckled with fine brown and reddish spots. Incubation lasts about 14 days, but other nesting details are largely unknown.|$|R
2500|$|Pigeon fanciers {{will often}} provide their mated pairs with nest boxes {{in which to}} build <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b> [...] Because pigeons are quite {{territorial}} about <b>their</b> <b>nesting</b> area pigeons co-exist much more harmoniously when each mated pair has two nest boxes of its own.|$|R
50|$|Though {{most social}} wasps like B. scutellaris will suffer from heavy {{vertebrate}} predation i.e. birds; ant predation on wasp nests {{is the most}} frequent and {{is considered to be}} the driving evolutionary force for <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> are frequently attacked because their eggs and larvae are concentrated and exposed in the combs. Furthermore, due to the sessile nature of <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> it makes it difficult for escape. Thus these social wasp nests are a heavily desired source of food for predators.|$|R

In a 1999 study, Pogonoscopus myrmex leafhoppers were placed in a banded sugar ant colony to test the reaction of non-host ants. These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to <b>their</b> <b>nest,</b> digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrel's large nasal {{olfactory}} bulbs {{facilitate a}} keen sense of smell, and the birds themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and can use it to locate <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> in the dark.|$|E
50|$|That is why birds build <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> differently.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} incubation {{behavior of}} this species is unknown. It is not certain which sex if not both incubated, nor what the specific timeline was. These birds evidently did not attack intruders approaching <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> which provides {{reason to believe that}} <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> were far apart from each other.|$|R

5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
50|$|Some bees: venom, {{to defend}} {{themselves}} and <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b>|$|R
25|$|Incubating {{females are}} {{sometimes}} pulled from <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> at night. Female pinyon jays may {{be vulnerable to}} nocturnal and diurnal predators because they are extremely reluctant to leave <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b> Because pinyon jays breed in loose colonies, a predator attuned to finding nests could potentially specialize on incubating or brooding females.|$|R
5|$|The Pompilidae {{specialize}} in catching spiders to provision <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E

50|$|Melissotarsus {{is a rare}} African genus of ants in the {{subfamily}} Myrmicinae. They {{are known}} from the Afrotropics and Malagasy regions, where <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> are located in living wood, built by tunneling through the wood under the surface. They are rarely seen outside of <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> which may contribute to their perceived rarity.|$|R
5|$|Mature adult ants of {{this species}} mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects are given to their larvae {{collected}} while foraging. However, larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size. Workers will mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the honeydew which is taken to <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> to feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies.|$|E
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either {{lay their eggs}} on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of <b>their</b> <b>nest,</b> or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Nests are {{arranged}} in colonies consisting of about three to 15 nests each. Often, pumpkinseeds build <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> near bluegill colonies, and the two species interbreed. Male pumpkinseeds are vigorous and aggressive, and defend <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> by spreading <b>their</b> opercula. Because of this aggressive behavior, pumpkinseeds tend to maintain larger territories than bluegills.|$|R
