5|$|Clinton has {{identified}} two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, {{that contributed to}} his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> meet President John F. Kennedy. The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.|$|E

Just as the Boss is informed, the invasion begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak, who captures the entire cabinet, including the Boss.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} her at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> present {{her with the}} 1 gram of radium collected in the United States. Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed {{by the fact that}} she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a passageway already existed connecting <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> the Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started as a joke among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L. Mills was secretly accessing the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> the home of a friend.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> listen to his criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Treasury Building is {{the center}} of a network of {{underground}} tunnels.

Unlike <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> Treasury Building tunnel, which was constructed as an emergency exit, the other tunnels were built to facilitate the movement of freight and access to utility lines.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died.

Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the District Court, Higginbotham developed a relationship with President Johnson, attending various White House functions and conferences in the mid-1960s.

Other notable figures at the meeting were Vice President Humphrey, Justice Marshall, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Andrew Brimmer, Clarence Mitchell, Clifford Alexander, and Bayard Rustin. Higginbotham stayed the night at the White House, attended a service at the Washington National Cathedral, and continued to advise the President into the next days.|$|E

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The City of Washington was {{bordered by}} Boundary Street {{to the north}} (renamed Florida Avenue in 1890), Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east. Washington's street grid was extended, where possible, {{throughout}} the District starting in 1888. Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895. Some streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> the Capitol and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, {{many of which are}} on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.|$|E
5|$|The Obamas' daughters {{attended}} the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school. As {{a member of}} the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school. Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School in Washington, after also considering Georgetown Day School. Michelle stated in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they do not intend to have any more children. The Obamas have received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House. Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> assist with child care.|$|E

5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy.

This was an attempt by <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attaché, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> meet President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt practiced wrestling and boxing while in the White House, and he had received jujutsu jackets from William Sturgis Bigelow and jujutsu lessons from J. J. O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer who had studied jujutsu while living in Nagasaki. Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo lessons to the President and interested family and staff in {{a room at the}} White House. Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave lessons to prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth (sister of Kindergarten pioneer Susan Blow), Hallie Elkins (wife of Senator Stephen Benton Elkins), and Grace Davis Lee (Hallie Elkins' sister), and their children.|$|E
