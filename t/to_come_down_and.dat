5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... {{and as for the}} prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Landis having {{both the}} {{judicial}} and baseball positions began {{almost as soon}} as his baseball appointment was announced in November 1920. On February 2, 1921, lame duck Congressman Benjamin F. Welty (Democrat-Ohio) offered a resolution calling for Landis's impeachment. On February 11, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer opined that there was no legal impediment to Landis holding both jobs. [...] On February 14, the House Judiciary Committee voted 24–1 to investigate Landis. Reed Landis later stated, [...] "one of the other congressmen wanted Father impeached but they did want him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> defend himself because they knew what a show it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the spring}} of 1977, the three senior Sex Pistols had been {{returning}} to the studio periodically with Chris Thomas to lay down the tracks for the band's debut album. Initially to be called God Save Sex Pistols, it became known during the summer as Never Mind the Bollocks. According to Jones, [...] "Sid wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> play on the album, and we tried as hard as possible not to let him anywhere near the studio. Luckily he had hepatitis at the time." [...] Cook later described {{how many of the}} instrumental tracks were built up from drum and guitar parts, rather than the usual drum and bass.|$|E

500|$|After her promotional {{activities}} {{ended in}} Japan, Carey flew to Hawaii for a three-day music video shoot from June 8–10, 2008. The video {{was directed by}} Chris Applebaum and premiered on BET's 106 & Park on July 3, 2008 at 6:00pm ET/PT and on Yahoo! Music at midnight on the same day. It later appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) on July 7, 2008. Aside from the video's original version, the remix also featured an accompanying video, with some additional scenes from T.I. Some of the scenes were filmed on the beaches of Hawaii, {{while some of the}} smaller parts were shot in Wet'n'Wild Hawaii. According to several reports, Carey was seriously injured on the set of the video during shooting on June 9. Carey's representative quickly denied the allegation, and said [...] "She was so excited to be shooting in Hawaii. She wanted all her friends <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{be a part of the}} shoot." [...] After watching the music video, Tim Nixon from The Sun called it [...] "mouth-watering", and wrote [...] "if she carries on churning out three-and-a-half-minute visual feasts like this, long may that continue..." ...|$|E
500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E

[...] Abu Dabbus {{captured}} Marrakesh in 1266, but refused to hand it over to the Marinids, forcing Abu Yusuf Yaqub <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lay siege to it himself. [...] The Marinids finally captured the city in September 1269. The Almohad remnant retreated to the Atlas stronghold of Tinmel and continued putting up resistance until they were finally defeated in 1276.|$|E
2500|$|MTV {{began its}} annual Spring Break {{coverage}} in 1986, setting up temporary operations in Daytona Beach, Florida, {{for a week}} in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. [...] "Spring break is a youth culture event", MTV's vice president Doug Herzog said at the time. [...] "We {{wanted to be part}} of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there are the kinds of people who watch MTV." [...] The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location. The annual tradition would continue into the 2000s, when it would become de-emphasized and handed off to mtvU, the spin-off channel of MTV targeted at college campuses.|$|E

When Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) discovered him there, she asked him to move on. When she saw Daniel had still not left, Imogen told Paul Robinson <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> tell him to leave, but Paul was [...] "delighted" [...] to find the camper was actually his nephew. Dennis called Daniel's arrival [...] "a huge surprise" [...] for Paul and {{thought it was a good}} distraction for him. Paul's happiness was short-lived when Daniel told him he was only passing through, but after a phone call to his mother, Daniel changed his mind and stayed for his uncle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz. Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich.

2500|$|At dawn, Zhang Liao donned his armour, {{carried a}} ji, and led {{his men to}} attack the enemy formation. He killed tens of enemy {{soldiers}} and two officers, shouted his own name, and broke through the barriers until he reached Sun Quan's command post. Sun Quan was shocked and his subordinates were all unsure of what to do. He {{then went to the}} top of a knoll, armed himself with a long ji, and stood there. He did not dare to move when Zhang Liao challenged him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> fight him. When Sun Quan saw that Zhang Liao did not have many soldiers left with him, he ordered his forces to surround Zhang and his men. However, Zhang Liao fought fiercely and succeeded in breaking out of the encirclement with a few of his men. His remaining men, who were still trapped by the enemy, shouted, [...] "General, are you abandoning us?" [...] Zhang Liao then turned back and fought his way into the encirclement and succeeded in rescuing his remaining men. Sun Quan and his forces were all stunned by Zhang Liao's valour and did not dare to stand in his way. The skirmish lasted from dawn to the afternoon, and the morale of Sun Quan's army had fallen significantly. Zhang Liao returned to Hefei fortress and strengthened his defences. The defenders felt much more at ease and were very impressed with him.|$|E

Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke on 9 August: [...] "...the Volunteer corps have shewn their readiness to act in support of Law and Order, {{in a manner that}} must give great satisfaction to all those, who wish to see them maintain'd ... in the manner, in which it has ended, I trust it will be productive of good, and tend much to the future quiet of the place".
