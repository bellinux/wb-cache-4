Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake.</b> This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E

Quentin tries <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E

The term badnjak lends itself to the literal meaning of Christmas Eve, with Badnji Dan meaning Christmas Eve Day, and Badnja Večer meaning Christmas Eve night.|$|R

Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E

Children (aged 8) and elderly people (aged 71) learned Swahili-French word pairs to criterion during a learning session taking place in the morning or evening (Wake and Sleep group, respectively). Participants spent 12 hours filled with wakefulness or a night of sleep, then performed a relearning session to criterion either in the evening (Wake) or the following morning (Sleep). One week later, retention was tested. Sleep appeared to affect memory differently according to age. The groups of children did not differ during the relearning session whereas the Sleep outperformed the Wake group after one week. In elderly participants, no effect of sleep was observed. Thus, the enhancing effect of sleep is most pronounced inadults, moderate in children, and weak in elderly people...|$|R

25|$|Paradoxical {{intention}} is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead {{of attempting to}} fall asleep at night, makes every effort <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory that may explain {{the effectiveness of this}} method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).|$|E

25|$|Nocturnal {{animals have}} higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and {{diminishing}} cortisol during the night—the inverse of diurnal animals. Nocturnal and diurnal animals both have increased electrical {{activity in the}} suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> at night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues. Cortisol levels in diurnal animals typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. In diurnal animals, sleepiness increases during the night.|$|E
25|$|Between Lussi Night and Yule, trolls {{and evil}} spirits, in some {{accounts}} also {{the spirits of}} the dead, were thought to be active outside. It was believed to be particularly dangerous to be out during Lussi Night. According to tradition, children who had done mischief had to take special care, since Lussi could come down through the chimney and take them away, and certain tasks of work in the preparation for Yule had to be finished, or else the Lussi would come to punish the household. The tradition of Lussevaka – <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> through the Lussinatt to guard oneself and the household against evil, has found a modern form through throwing parties until daybreak. Another company of spirits was said to come riding through the night around Yule itself, journeying through the air, over land and water.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{credible evidence}} of coffee-drinking or {{knowledge of the}} coffee tree appears {{in the middle of}} the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.

Coffee was used by Sufi circles <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>awake</b> for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen. One account credits Muhammad ben Said for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401.

25|$|In 156, Pius turned seventy. He found {{difficult}} to keep himself upright without stays.

As Pius aged, Marcus would have taken on more administrative duties, more still when the praetorian prefect (an office that was as much secretarial as military) Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157. In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Pius was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out. Two days before his death, the biographer records, Pius was at his ancestral estate in Lorium. He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. He ordered that the golden statue of Fortune, which had been in the bedroom of the emperors, should go to Marcus' bedroom. Pius turned over, as if going to sleep, and died. It was 7 March 161. Marcus was now emperor.|$|E

On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom.
