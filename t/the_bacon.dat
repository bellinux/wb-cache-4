5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of <b>the</b> <b>bacon</b> highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, <b>the</b> <b>bacon</b> should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking <b>the</b> <b>bacon</b> in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening <b>the</b> <b>bacon,</b> in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E

The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84Main Street, Colchester, Connecticut. The main structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. Noted for its plain, utilitarian floor plan consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway, the inside has seen some renovations throughout its history.

There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II.

5|$|Following the US 33 interchange, Skyline Drive heads {{southwest}}. The roadway {{passes through}} Smith Roach Gap {{and comes to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bacon</b> Hollow Overlook to the south, where it curves to the west.

The road bends south and comes to a ranger station at Simmonds Gap. Skyline Drive continues southerly to the Loft Mountain Overlook on the east side, where it turns westerly before heading northwest. The roadway then makes a hairpin turn to the southwest. The road straddles the border of Rockingham and Albemarle counties and continues to the south to the Loft Mountain Wayside, which is site of restrooms and food service. Skyline Drive heads southwest and comes to Loft Mountain, where a ranger station, restrooms, campground, and camp store are located. The drive heads past Browns Gap Parking before it comes to Dundo, where an overlook to the northwest, restrooms, picnic grounds, and Dundo Group Camp are located.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double <b>the</b> <b>bacon</b> of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on the {{gameplay}} aspects of <b>The</b> <b>Baconing.</b> Game Revolution's Nick Tan noted that the combat system had been upgraded from the previous two titles, and that {{the addition of a}} shield bash mechanic helped when enemies crowded the player character.

GamePro's Will Herring, however, felt the gameplay was repetitive and that the fetch quests did not feature enough variety. Though Christian Donlan of Eurogamer had some critical remarks in regards to gameplay he did note that the game is [...] "a fiercely likeable time-waster."
