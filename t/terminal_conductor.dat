40|$|Fluctuations {{are strong}} in {{mesoscopic}} systems {{and have to}} be taken into account for the description of transport. We show that they can even be used as a resource for the operation of a system as a device. We use the physics of single-electron tunneling to propose a bipartite device working as a thermal transistor. Charge and heat currents in a two <b>terminal</b> <b>conductor</b> can be gated by thermal fluctuations from a third terminal to which it is capacitively coupled. The gate system can act as a switch that injects neither charge nor energy into the conductor hence achieving huge amplification factors. Non-thermal properties of the tunneling electrons can be exploited to operate the device with no energy consumption. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures. Published versio...|$|E
40|$|We {{obtain the}} {{generating}} function for shot noise through a disordered multichannel conductor in the zero temperature quantum regime. The distribution of charge transmitted over a fixed time interval {{is found to}} be approximately Gaussian. 1 The nature of shot noise in mesoscopic systems at low temperatures has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Lesovik [1] showed that the intensity of the shot noise in a single channel two <b>terminal</b> <b>conductor</b> is supressed in the quantum regime compared to its classical value. This result has been generalized and applied to various other cases [2, 3, 4]. Levitov and Lesovik [5] later was able to obtain the entire distribution function for the charge transport over a fixed time interval for a single channel conductor and showed that the distribution function becomes binomial in the quantum regime as opposed to Poissonian in the classical regime. This result has been generalized to include shot noise in a superconductor-normal metal point contact [6] as well. In the present work we generalize the work of ref. [5] and evaluate the shot noise distribution function for a multichannel conductor. We obtain the generating function fo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During ground faults on {{transmission}} lines, {{a number}} of towers near the fault are likely to acquire high potentials to ground. These tower voltages, if excessive, may present a hazard to humans and animals. This paper presents analytical methods {{in order to determine}} the transmission towers potentials during ground faults, for long and short lines. The author developed a global systematic approach to calculate these voltages, which are dependent of {{a number of}} factors. Some of the most important factors are: magnitudes of fault currents, fault location with respect to the line <b>terminals,</b> <b>conductor</b> arrangement on the tower and the location of the faulted phase, the ground resistance of the faulted tower, soil resistivity, number, material and size of ground wires. The effects of these factors on the faulted tower voltages have been also examined for different types of power lines...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} generalize Landauer-Büttiker {{transport}} theory for multi-terminal spin transport in presence of spin-orbit interaction.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} propagation of heat currents in a three-terminal quantum dot engine. Electron-electron interactions introduce state-dependent processes which can be resolved by energy-dependent tunneling rates. We identify the relevant transitions which define {{the operation of the}} system as a thermal transistor or a thermal diode. In the former case, thermal-induced charge fluctuations in the gate dot modify the thermal currents in the conductor with suppressed heat injection, resulting in huge amplification factors and the possible gating with arbitrarily low energy cost. In the latter case, enhanced correlations of the state-selective tunneling transitions redistribute heat flows giving high rectification coefficients and the unexpected cooling of one <b>conductor</b> <b>terminal</b> by heating the other one. We propose quantum dot arrays as a possible way to achieve the extreme tunneling asymmetries required for the different operations. Comment: 18 pages (single column), 9 figures.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{correlations of}} current at contacts and voltage fluctuations at voltage probes coupled to interferometers. The results are compared with correlations {{of current and}} occupation number fluctuations at dephasing probes. We use a quantum Langevin approach for the average quantities and their fluctuations. For higher order correlations we develop a stochastic path integral approach and find the generating functions of voltage or occupation number fluctuations. We also derive a generating function for the joint distribution of voltage or occupation number at the probe and current fluctuations at a <b>terminal</b> of a <b>conductor.</b> For energy independent scattering we found earlier that the generating function of current cumulants in interferometers with a one-channel dephasing or voltage probe are identical. Nevertheless, the distribution function for voltage and the distribution function for occupation number fluctuations differ, the latter being broader than that of former in all examples considered here.

The effect on the joint performance of feasible optimization solutions, such as rotation of the terminal joints and sole RRR increase, is explored.

Magnet testing and sorting have never been easier. Additional features including calculating magnetic field intensity versus time and displaying magnetic field direction on a Graphical User Interface on Computer.   Introduction/Background:  Magnetic fields are invisible to the naked eye but yet there is a need to detect magnetic fields for applications in manufacturing industry and research. Applications include testing of electromagnetic machinery like electric motors to see if it works correctly, or to detect magnetic field properties like mapping landscapes. A gaussmeter can use Hall Effect sensors that utilize the Hall Effect to detect perpendicular magnetic field intensity. The Hall Effect causes a voltage to be developed between two <b>terminals</b> on a <b>conductor</b> if there is a perpendicular magnetic field and a current going through the conductor.

50|$|Using a {{high voltage}} {{terminal}} kept at a static potential {{on the order}} of millions of volts, charged particles can be accelerated. In simple language, an electrostatic generator is basically a giant capacitor (although lacking plates). The high voltage is achieved either using the methods of Cockcroft & Walton or Van de Graaff, with the accelerators often being named after these inventors. Van de Graaff's original design places electrons on an insulating sheet, or belt, with a metal comb, and then the sheet physically transports the immobilized electrons to the terminal. Although at high voltage, the <b>terminal</b> is a <b>conductor,</b> and there is a corresponding comb inside the conductor which can pick up the electrons off the sheet; owing to Gauss's law, there is no electric field inside a conductor, so the electrons are not repulsed by the platform once they are inside. The belt is similar in style to a conventional conveyor belt, with one major exception: it is seamless. Thus, if the belt is broken, the accelerator must be disassembled to some degree in order to replace the belt, which, owing to its constant rotation and being made typically of a rubber, is not a particularly uncommon occurrence. The practical difficulty with belts led to a different medium for physically transporting the charges: a chain of pellets. Unlike a normal chain, this one is non-conducting {{from one end to the}} other, as both insulators and conductors are used in its construction. These type of accelerators are usually called Pelletrons.|$|R
