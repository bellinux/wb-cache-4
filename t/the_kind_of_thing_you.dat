500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2014 CGI special's release, a comic which was {{published}} by IDW Publishing was withdrawn after retailers complained {{that they wanted to}} boycott the issue. The comic, which shows the Powerpuff Girls with breasts and dressed in latex, was designed by an artist who works for Cartoon Network. The artist was [...] "thinking of it more along the lines of 'female empowerment' than <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> guys are talking about". Cartoon Network said in a statement: [...] "We recognise some fans' reaction to the cover and, as such, will no longer be releasing it at comic book shops." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E

500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time.

However, it is the substance we have to deal with, not the shadow, and that's real enough, for his signature on a death warrant is as good as that of the Pope, or his gracious Majesty King Philip, or, for the matter of that, of Alva himself.

6000|$|Now, is that <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> {{want to come}} to everywhere? Because, if it be, and {{you tell}} me so distinctly, I think I can make several {{suggestions}} to-night, and could make more if you give me time, which would materially advance your object. The extent of our operations at present is more or less limited by the extent of coal and ironstone, but we have not yet learned to make proper use of our clay. Over the greater part of England, south of the manufacturing districts, there are magnificent beds of various kinds of useful clay; and I believe {{that it would not be}} difficult to point out modes of employing it which might enable us to turn nearly the whole of the south of England into a brickfield, as we have already turned nearly the whole of the north into a coal-pit. I say [...] "nearly" [...] the whole, because, as you are doubtless aware, there are considerable districts in the south composed of chalk renowned up to the present time for their downs and mutton. But, I think, by examining carefully into the conceivable uses of chalk, we might discover a quite feasible probability of turning all the chalk districts into a limekiln, as we turn the clay districts into a brickfield. There would then remain nothing but the mountain districts to be dealt with; but, as we have not yet ascertained all the uses of clay and chalk, still less have we ascertained those of stone; and I think, by draining the useless inlets of the Cumberland, Welsh, and Scotch lakes, and turning them, with their rivers, into navigable reservoirs and canals, there would be no difficulty in working the whole of our mountain districts as a gigantic quarry of slate and granite, from which all the rest of the world might be supplied with roofing and building stone.|$|E

'Nay, but finally, work must be done, and some one must be at the top, some one at the bottom.' Granted, my friends. Work must always be, and captains of work must always be; and if you in the least remember the tone of any of my writings, you must know that they are thought unfit for this age, because they are always insisting on need of government, and speaking with scorn of liberty. But I beg you to observe that there is a wide difference between being captains or governors of work, and taking the profits of it. It does not follow, because you are general of an army, that you are to take all the treasure, or land, it wins (if it fight for treasure or land); neither, because you are king of a nation, that you are to consume all the profits of the nation's work. Real kings, on the contrary, are known invariably by their doing quite the reverse of this,--by their taking the least possible quantity of the nation's work for themselves. There is no test of real kinghood so infallible as that. Does the crowned creature live simply, bravely, unostentatiously? probably he is a King. Does he cover his body with jewels, and his table with delicates? in all probability he is not a King. It is possible he may be, as Solomon was; but that is when the nation shares his splendour with him. Solomon made gold, not only to be in his own palace as stones, but to be in Jerusalem as stones. But even so, for the most part, these splendid kinghoods expire in ruin, and only the true kinghoods live, which are of royal labourers governing loyal labourers; who, both leading rough lives, establish the true dynasties. Conclusively you will find that because you are king of a nation, it does not follow that you are to gather for yourself all the wealth of that nation; neither, because you are king of {{a small part of the}} nation, and lord over the means of its maintenance--over field, or mill, or mine, are you to take all the produce of that piece of the foundation of national existence for yourself.|$|E
