40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} temperature measurement {{in the last four}} centuries using thermometers based on the thermal expansion of liquids such as ethyl alcohol and mercury. The concept of temperature was strongly dependent on the researcher and there was no systematic temperature scale for universal use. The precursor of the common thermometer was the thermoscope, probably invented {{at the end of the}} XVIth century. In the XVIIIth century the instrument was greatly improved and several <b>thermometric</b> <b>scales</b> were proposed some of which have been in use until now. These scales were based on arbitrary points. Mercury and ethyl alcohol were the most employed thermometric fluids. In the XIXth century, the concept of absolute zero was a great advance in this field. The most important contribution during the XXth century was the establishment of international temperature scales. The design of the thermometer has been essentially the same along the last 300 years, but many models were proposed for industrial and research purposes. Its association with the densimeter was of great importance for control of industrial chemical processes and also for teaching purposes in the past. Nowadays, there is a clear tendency to replace mercury-based thermometers by electronic digital models. Thermochemistry is the natural relationship between temperature and chemistry...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{historical}} {{case study}} of Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit’s creation of the first mercury thermometer with reliable scales is {{used as the basis}} for a lesson that is designed to provide students with a richer insight into the arbitrary nature of thermometer scales. The lesson attempts to move students beyond a level of understanding that is based simply on knowing how to read and use a thermometer, to a level of understanding that is based on knowing the very procedures and principles used to create <b>thermometric</b> <b>scales.</b> By studying the criteria that Fahrenheit used to create his scale, students should begin to obtain a richer insight into the arbitrary nature of thermometer scales in general. It is argued that it is insufficient to teach students how to read and use thermometers without giving them some notion of how a scale came into existence because no real insight is being provided into the nature of science. Students must be introduced to the actual procedures used by scientists if they are to understand how scientists have obtained their knowledge. The use of the historical example moves the teaching of science beyond the "cold " facts of science to the dynamic processes that are behind the facts. The extreme of teaching science as infallible is avoided by focusing on the idea that science is a human product that is subject to change. This paper does not advocate teaching science as a historical discipline, but rather argues that part of the science curriculum should include historical cases, such as the creation of the Fahrenheit temperature scale, in order to bring out the specific characteristics of science...|$|R

Originally men's knowledge of weights and forces {{was in the same}} condition as their knowledge of smells and tastes is now--a knowledge not extending beyond that given by the unaided sensations; and it remained so until weighing instruments and dynamometers were invented. Before there were hour-glasses and clepsydras, most phenomena could be estimated as to their durations and intervals, with no greater precision than degrees of hardness can be estimated by the fingers. Until a <b>thermometric</b> <b>scale</b> was contrived, men's judgments respecting relative amounts of heat stood on the same footing with their present judgments respecting relative amounts of sound. And as in these initial stages, with no aids to observation, only the roughest comparisons of cases could be made, and only the most marked differences perceived; it is obvious that only the most simple laws of dependence could be ascertained--only those laws which, being uncomplicated with others, and not disturbed in their manifestations, required no niceties of observation to disentangle them. Whence it appears not only that in proportion as knowledge becomes quantitative do its previsions become complete as well as certain, but that until its assumption of a quantitative character it is necessarily confined to the most elementary relations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − We have {{developed}} a blackbody block system for comparing thermocouple temperature scales realized using fixed-point and radiation methods. Platinum/palladium, type S and type B thermocouples were calibrated using the freezing points of Ag, Cu, Fe-C, Co-C, and Pd (only for Type B). The radiation thermometer used was an LP 4 linear pyrometer operated at a central wavelength of 650 nm. Two scales were compared from 962 to 1544 °C, and {{it was found that}} the two scales were consistent within 0. 5 °C up to 1400 °C, but the discrepancy increased to 2. 0 °C at 1544 °C for the type B thermocouple. In terms of the measurement uncertainty, the <b>thermometric</b> and radiometric <b>scales</b> realized at KRISS were in agreement up to the freezing temperature of Pd...|$|R

Like Gay-Lussac, Thomson calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to −273 °C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale. It's noteworthy that Thomson's value of −273 was actually derived from 0.00366, which was the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice point. The inverse of −0.00366 expressed to five significant digits is −273.22 °C which is remarkably close to the true value of −273.15 °C.|$|E
50|$|Already in {{the early}} days of its existence, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) {{proceeded}} to define a standard <b>thermometric</b> <b>scale,</b> using the boiling point of water. Since the boiling point varies with the atmospheric pressure, the CIPM needed to define a standard atmospheric pressure. The definition they chose was based on the weight of a column of mercury of 760 mm. But since that weight depends on the local gravity, they now also needed a standard gravity. The 1887 CIPM meeting decided as follows: The value of this standard acceleration due to gravity is equal to the acceleration due to gravity at the International Bureau (alongside the Pavillon de Breteuil) divided by 1.0003322, the theoretical coefficient required to convert to a latitude of 45° at sea level. All that was needed to obtain a numerical value for standard gravity was now to measure the gravitational strength at the International Bureau. This task was given to Gilbert Étienne Defforges of the Geographic Service of the French Army. The value he found, based on measurements taken in March and April 1888, was 9.80991(5) m·s−2.|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} clinical {{procedure of}} recording a patient 2 ̆ 7 s temperature {{depends upon the}} accuracy of thermometers. This in turn depends upon the accuracy of two fixed datum points (the freezing and boiling points of water) and subsequently on the fine calibration of the etched scale between them. Anders Celsius (1701 - 44) defined the boiling point of water as the upper fixed point of the <b>thermometric</b> <b>scale,</b> originally designated as 08 C but inverted by Carl Linnaeus (1707 - 78) to read 1008 C. In 1724 Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686 - 1736) had observed that the upper fixed point, that of boiling water, varied with changes in atmospheric pressure. An English scientist, Sir George Shuckburgh (after 1794 known as Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn), addressed this problem and over the period 1774 - 79 he defined {{the relationship of the}} temperature of boiling water to barometric pressure. This latter variable changed both with the ambient meteorological conditions of the moment and the height above sea level at which the calibrations were made. Clinical thermometry depends on an accuracy of 0. 18 C in both the baseline and the tracking of a patient 2 ̆ 7 s temperature but Shuckburgh 2 ̆ 7 s experiments showed that the upper fixed point of reference, that of boiling water, could change by up to 108 C. He demonstrated that these variables must be measured and controlled in the manufacture and calibration of thermometers. Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn published his results in the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society (1777 - 79) and made possible the accuracy of thermometry on which patient care depends...|$|E
40|$|The casual {{observation}} of dogfishes in aquaria reveals immediately a noteworthy regularity in the rhythmic {{movement of the}} gill-slits. The movements of the spiracles are coordinated in a perfect way {{with those of the}} slits and they go on with the same regularity, without in terruption, for long periods. All these features seemed to point to the suitability of this animal for a study of the frequency of gill move ments as controlled by temperature. The previous work of Bethe, Baglioni, and others had shown con siderable irregularity in the Q 10 ratio (cf. Kanitz, 1915); the observa tions of Crozier and Stier (1924 â€” 25) on the opercular breathing rhythm in the goldfish, on the contrary, showed regularity in this rhythm under properly controlled conditions and demonstrated the applicability of the Arrhenius equation to the data obtained. Would the dogfish obey the same nile and in a similar way? For the observations, young specimens (25 to 37 cm. long) were kept in a large aquarium the temperature of which was maintained constant to within Â± 0. 05 Â ° C. for periods of 30 to 50 minutes at any given temperature. The number of points on the <b>thermometric</b> <b>scale</b> chosen for the observations was made as large as possible, and in gen eral at each temperature from 20 to 30 series of 20 beats were timed with a stop watch. The regularity of the breathing rhythm at constant temperature is remarkable; countings of 20 to 30 successive series of 20 beats often agreed to within 1 to 2 per cent. The only exception seems to be around 15 Â°C. where more erratic values are found. We will come back later to this point. Let us note also that Crozier and Stier have found agreement of the same order of magnitude. Care was taken to allow time for complete temperature equilibrium between the organism and the medium, the water of the aquarium also being stirred gently. The aquarium was almost completely insulated by a cover which. cut out most of the light; {{a small portion of the}} surface only was left uncovered to permit observation. The water in the aquarium was kept as close as possible to saturation with air, so as to exclude any possible effect of 02 concentration. Observations mad...|$|E
