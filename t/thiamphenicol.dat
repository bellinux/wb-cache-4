Plasma concentrations of <b>thiamphenicol</b> were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography on blood samples collected over 24 h following treatment. Pharmacokinetic variables of the drug were calculated for both species and after both administration routes. After intravenous administration of <b>thiamphenicol,</b> a rapid distribution phase was followed by a slower elimination phase and, when <b>thiamphenicol</b> was administered p. o., the bioavailability was about 60 % in both species. The higher volume of distribution and the longer biological elimination half-lives in pre-ruminant compared with adult animals indicate that <b>thiamphenicol</b> distributes widely into the extravascular compartment of pre-ruminants. Interspecies differences were observed in the kinetic behaviour of <b>thiamphenicol</b> with respect to peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life ðT 1 = 2 Þ and total clearance ðClBÞ.

The analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and <b>thiamphenicol</b> against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of Escherichia coli, seven strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, <b>thiamphenicol,</b> and the three analogs. Sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0. 5 microgram/ml for all strains). Four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant Haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs.

In contrast, when compared with chloramphenicol, 2 to 16 times as much of <b>thiamphenicol</b> was required to inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, making prediction of the susceptibility of these strains to <b>thiamphenicol</b> on the basis of chloramphenicol testing alone likely to be hazardous. Disc diffusion test using 30 μg discs and 12 mm as cut off point was a reliable technique to determine susceptibility of bacteria either to chloramphenicol or <b>thiamphenicol.</b> When <b>thiamphenicol</b> discs of greater potency (50 μg) were employed, many strains exhibited wide zones of inhibition although most of them were resistant by the agar dilution method (MIC> 12. 5 μg/ml).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasmid-mediated and chromosomal-mediated {{resistance}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin, tetracycline, <b>thiamphenicol,</b> and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has spread dramatically in Africa. Monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility {{is a key}} element in the control of sexually transmitted diseases. GOAL: To document antimicrobial susceptibilities of gonococci isolated during the past 15 years in Kigali, Rwanda. STUDY DESIGN: Minimal inhibitory concentrations of recently collected gonococcal isolates of eight antimicrobials were determined. The results were compared with data collected for isolates obtained since 1986. RESULTS: In 1986, 35 % of the gonococcal isolates were penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae. Tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae appeared in 1989. The prevalence of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae and tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae increased significantly to 70. 5 % and 89. 2 %, respectively. Chromosomal resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and <b>thiamphenicol</b> increased temporarily, then decreased significantly. Chromosomal resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appeared in 1988 and increased to 21. 6 %. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, and kanamycin. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated the rapidly increasing frequencies of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae and tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae. Chromosomal resistance to <b>thiamphenicol</b> and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole excludes these drugs as alternative treatment. Programs for antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of N gonorrhoeae should urgently be established in Africa...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the efficacy of the combination of <b>thiamphenicol</b> glycinate acetylcysteinate plus beclomethasone, administered as aerosol, in children awaiting tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. The study comprised 204 children, aged 1 to 12 years, with chronic adenotonsillitis who had been listed for surgery due to obstructive symptoms and recurrent acute infections. Patients were randomized to treatment with <b>thiamphenicol</b> glycinate acetylcysteinate, dosage 250 mg/day in 2 administrations plus beclomethasone with a dosage of 400 mu g/day in 2 administrations, or no treatment, control group, unless required. The drugs were administered by aerosol for 10 days/month over a period of 6 months. Clinical visits were at 4, 7 and 12 months after the start of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was the reduction in the number of patients requiring surgery. Secondary efficacy measures were the reduction of nasal obstruction, the decrease in the number of infectious episodes and the tolerability of the treatment. Aerosol treatment with <b>thiamphenicol</b> glycinate acetylcysteinate plus beclomethasone resulted in a significantly lower proportion of patients requiring surgery (29 of 101; 29 %) compared to patients in the control group (100 of 103; 97 %) (p < 0. 0001). Treatment was also associated with a reduction of nasal obstruction and a decrease in the number of infectious episodes. No treatment-related adverse events were reported and the aerosol therapy proved easy to administer to children. The aerosol therapy with the combination of <b>thiamphenicol</b> glycinate acetylcysteinate plus beclomethasone was able to prevent or postpone surgery in a substantial percentage of patients, without adverse events.

40|$|Until recently, {{the only}} common strains of {{antimicrobial}} agent-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae detected in Indonesia were penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains. Despite {{the spread of}} resistance to other antimicrobial agents among N. gonorrhoeae in Southeast Asia, surveillance for such resistance in Indonesia has been limited. We evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of 86 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from female sex workers in Surabaya, Indonesia, to 13 antimicrobial agents. Of the 86 isolates, 89 % were resistant to penicillin (MIC, > or = 2. 0 micrograms/ml), 98 % were resistant to tetracycline (MIC, > or = 2. 0 micrograms/ml), 18. 1 % were resistant to spectinomycin (MIC, > or = 128. 0 micrograms/ml), and 97. 7 % showed decreased susceptibility to <b>thiamphenicol</b> (MIC, 1 to 2 micrograms/ml). Thus, <b>thiamphenicol</b> and spectinomycin may be approaching {{the end of their}} usefulness as the drugs of choice for the treatment of gonococcal infections in Surabaya. While the susceptibilities of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefixime, and cefoxitin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) are universal, these drugs have not been used because they are more expensive in Indonesia than <b>thiamphenicol.</b> We conclude that Surabaya had the highest reported rate of penicillin and tetracycline resistance among the Southeast Asian countries and that cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones should be reasonable alternatives for the treatment of gonorrhea in this locale...|$|E

However, in most cases they were high enough to inhibit most strains of gram-negative bacilli responsible for prostatitis.
