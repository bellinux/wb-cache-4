5|$|GO {{has always}} owned its {{locomotives}} and coaches, but its <b>trackage</b> {{used to be}} owned entirely by Canada's two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). In 1988, as part of expanding service east of Pickering, GO built its first section of self-owned purpose-built <b>trackage.</b> From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only 6% of the railway <b>trackage</b> on which it operated. Starting in 2009, Metrolinx incrementally acquired further <b>trackage</b> from the two commercial railways {{in order to improve}} GO service. As of 2014, Metrolinx has complete ownership of the Barrie, Stouffville and Lakeshore East lines, and a majority of the Lakeshore West, Richmond Hill, and Kitchener lines. CP still owns most of the Milton line. This puts Metrolinx ownership at 80% of GO Transit's <b>trackage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The meatpacking {{district}} was served between 1908 and 1957 {{by a short}} Chicago 'L' line with several stops, devoted primarily to the daily transport of thousands of workers and even tourists to the site. The line was constructed when the City of Chicago forced the removal of surface <b>trackage</b> on 40th Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The <b>trackage</b> and other infrastructure {{is owned by}} the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the rolling stock is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). Rolling stock maintenance is performed by NSB-owned Mantena.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{service was}} {{eliminated}} entirely in 1934. Conrail, the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor, sold the remaining <b>trackage</b> in the 1980s to the Indiana and Ohio Railway, a short line {{now owned by}} RailAmerica. That company continues to provide local freight service on the ex-CL, and the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad operates tourist trains on {{a portion of the}} line near Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{have been}} the primary way of linking {{countries}} in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century. It {{has always been the}} main way of transport in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union up until today. The union ranks 2nd in {{the world in terms of}} railway <b>trackage</b> (about 7.8% of the world's share). However it is still looking to improve cross-border trade within the union.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority {{operates}} the ExpressRail rail services within the seaport area, including dockside <b>trackage</b> and railyards for transloading. It interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) on the Chemical Coast Secondary, Norfolk Southern (NS), CSX Transportation (CSX), and Canadian Pacific (CP). From January through October 2014 the system handled 391,596 rail lifts. As of 2014, three ExpressRail systems (Elizabeth, Newark, Staten Island) were in operation {{with the construction}} of a fourth at Port Jersey underway.|$|E
5|$|Weakened by the {{prolonged}} economic downturn of the Panic of 1893, the Northern Pacific went bankrupt in October 1893, {{and was forced}} to end its ownership of the Chicago and Northern Pacific, including Grand Central Station. Ultimately, tenant railroad Baltimore and Ohio purchased the station at foreclosure in 1910 along with all the terminal <b>trackage</b> to form the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (B).|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's <b>trackage</b> to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} <b>trackage</b> for cargo was increased, {{with a wide}} section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port {{facility}} at Brattøra, though the filling of {{a large part of}} the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The <b>trackage</b> and other infrastructure {{is owned by}} the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the rolling stock is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The service between Stavanger and Sandnes operate with a fixed schedule every 15 minutes. Of the trains to Sandnes, half continue onwards to Nærbø, giving a 30-minute headway. One train per hour operate all the way to Egersund. On weekends and late evenings, there is a reduced service. Travel time from Stavanger to Sandnes is 19 minutes, from Stavanger to Nærbø is 37 minutes, and from Stavanger to Egersund is 1 hour and 7 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their <b>trackage</b> around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified <b>trackage</b> north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 21st century, {{progress}} continued despite several disasters. The September 11 attacks {{resulted in}} service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan, particularly the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath the World Trade Center. Sections of the tunnel, {{as well as}} the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged. Rebuilding required the suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were closed for cleanup. By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc, flooding several underwater tunnels and other facilities near New York Harbor, as well as <b>trackage</b> over Jamaica Bay. The immediate damage was fixed within six months but long-term resiliency and rehabilitation projects continue.|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road <b>trackage</b> to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 2010, the US Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $55.5M TIGER grant for {{the station in}} West Fitchburg and a new layover {{facility}} {{in the town of}} Westminster. In June 2010, the MBTA and Pan Am Railways reached an agreement for <b>trackage</b> rights and fees on several lines, including MBTA access to Wachusett station and the layover on the Pan Am Southern mainline partially owned by Pan Am Railways. The project officially began with a publicized groundbreaking on October 18, 2010, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2012. However, by February 2012, the station was just at 30% design phase, with track and signals to reach 30% design by late spring. As of then, the estimated completion date was October 2013.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Oslo, the North Line (now named the Gjøvik Line) was being built as {{standard}} gauge; it was considered the new mainline northwards, and was to be connected to the mainline through Gudbrandsdalen. By building a branch line from Roa to Hønefoss, the Bergens Line could be connected to Nordbanen, allowing standard gauge <b>trackage</b> all the way to Oslo Østbanestasjon (Oslo Ø). This also gave another advantage, as Oslo Ø was seen as superior to Oslo V; the latter only served limited commuter routes west of town while Oslo Ø was the main station for long-distance trains to Trondheim, as well as Gothenburg and Stockholm in Sweden, with whom Norway was in a union with at the time. Only by terminating at Oslo Ø would direct transfer to trains {{to other parts of the}} country be possible.|$|E
5|$|The route {{parallels}} the track for roughly , over which time it passes {{to the north}} of Greenlawn Memorial Park. As the <b>trackage</b> and the highway approach a point known as Amboy Station, NY173 curves away from the railroad and heads southeast toward Amboy. After making the turn, NY173 meets Pottery Road (County Route164 or CR164), a local road leading to Camillus Airport, a simple one-runway facility located adjacent to the railroad line. NY173 continues into and through Amboy, passing a large area of tailings that was once the site of the Syracuse Municipal Airport. The brownfields are bordered to the north by Ninemile Creek and to the south by the Old Erie Canal, both of which are traversed by NY173 on its way into the densely populated Fairmount neighborhood of Camillus.|$|E
5|$|There were {{frequent}} {{fires and}} maintenance {{problems on the}} Jamaica Bay viaduct. The most notorious of these problems was a fire in May 1950 between The Raunt and Broad Channel Stations. After this fire, the LIRR abandoned the Jamaica Bay viaduct and the Queens portion of the Rockaway Beach/Far Rockaway route. On June 11, 1952, the city acquired all <b>trackage</b> west of Mott Avenue, incorporating {{it as part of}} the IND Rockaway Line. Service provided by the A train over the line began in June 1956, with the full western spur to Rockaway Park operational. While the remainder of the line operated, with Beach 25th Street–Wavecrest serving as the eastern spur terminal, a new Far Rockaway subway station was constructed, opening on January 16, 1958.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the CL's independence, various larger {{companies}} {{were looking to}} acquire it, mainly for the valuable Court Street terminal property. The most persistent rumor was that the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ, later a NYC line) would buy the CL as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ had built south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and initially acquired <b>trackage</b> rights over the CH to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL and CJ convinced the CH that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH attempted to acquire the CJ in 1892. But the CL stopped the consolidation based on Ohio's laws prohibiting such anti-competitive practices, and the CJ continued {{to look at the}} CL as a possible part of its line. After the CL's conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ secured <b>trackage</b> rights over the CL into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL at Hageman. The CJ also acquired the long-dormant Deer Creek Tunnel project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL The Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Little Miami Railroad that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) acquired a majority of the CL's stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{from the}} local {{community}} {{to build a new}} station at 178th Street occurred as early as 1932; several of these requests came from the Jamaica Estates Association. In June 1936, the association petitioned Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia for the extension. As early as 1936, the New York City Board of Transportation (predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority and the MTA) was evaluating construction of the station along with further eastward extensions of the line, with the board's 1940 budget allocating funding for the station. Under the 1940 plans, construction of the station was set to take place between 1941 and 1945. In January 1941, city councilman James A. Burke proposed extending the line to 178th Street, in order to relieve congestion at 169th Street. Burke believed that a station could be built within the existing tunnel and <b>trackage</b> and cost only $100,000, while engineers from the Board of Transportation stated it would require additional tunneling and new relay tracks extending to 184th Street. In July 1941, the Board of Transportation requested funding for a new express terminal station to replace 169th Street. Construction was delayed, however, due to material shortages caused by the Great Depression, and further delayed due to the onset of World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Britain {{commenced}} {{an official}} programme of metrication that, , {{had not been}} completed. The British metrication programme signalled the start of metrication programmes elsewhere in the Commonwealth, though India had started its programme in 1959, six years before the United Kingdom. South Africa (then {{not a member of}} the Commonwealth) set up a Metrication Advisory Board in 1967, New Zealand set up its Metric Advisory Board in 1969, Australia passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1970 and Canada appointed a Metrication Commission in 1971. Metrication in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade, while metrication in India and Canada is not complete. In addition the lakh and crore are still in widespread use in India, while in Canada the square foot is still widespread for commercial and residential advertisements and partially in construction because of the close trade relations with the United States, and the railways of Canada continue to measure their <b>trackage</b> in miles and speed limits in miles per hour because they also operate in the United States. Most other Commonwealth countries adopted the metric system during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Not {{including}} second, {{third and}} fourth main-line <b>trackage,</b> yard <b>trackage,</b> and siding <b>trackage,</b> BNSF directly owns and operates over 24,000 miles (38,624 kilometers) of track. When these additional tracks are counted, the length of track which the railway directly controls rises to more than 50,000 miles (80,467 kilometers).|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{was greatly}} {{affected by the}} Good Friday earthquake which struck southern Alaska in 1964. The yard and <b>trackage</b> around Seward buckled and the <b>trackage</b> along Turnagain Arm was damaged by floodwaters and landslides. It took several months to restore full service along the line.|$|E
25|$|The St. Croix Valley still {{retains its}} <b>trackage</b> rights to Brook Park MN.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak's Adirondack and Ethan Allen Express trains also operate over former D <b>trackage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{line from}} Bordentown heading north to Robbinsville is operated by CSX as the Robbinsville Industrial Track. The line ceased being a through route in 1967 when the PRR severed <b>trackage</b> between Windsor-Hightstown. Conrail abandoned the Hightstown-Cranbury segment in late 1982; additional <b>trackage</b> between Windsor-Robbinsville was dismantled in 2011 by Conrail Shared Assets. CSX operates the line north of Cranbury to South Amboy via Jamesburg.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, <b>trackage</b> {{rights over}} the bridge were {{obtained}} by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, a bridge line owned equally by six companies including the PRR and B (which obtained <b>trackage</b> rights over the PRR to reach the bridge on July 1, 1904). In 1991, the RF was merged into CSX Transportation, which acquired the bridge itself in 1998, after the Conrail breakup.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, and Southern Railway of British Columbia have <b>trackage</b> {{running through}} Surrey.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 it {{merged with}} the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW), which {{abandoned}} most of the CGW's <b>trackage.</b>|$|E
25|$|CPR assumed all {{operations}} and the D did not maintain any locomotives or rolling stock. Under CPR, {{the condition of}} the D <b>trackage</b> was upgraded and much excess track removed. Although for a short time the D was again in limbo and in 1996 CPR placed it and other money-losing <b>trackage</b> in the eastern U.S. and Canada into a separate operating company named St. Lawrence and Hudson Railway. In 2000, the St.L was merged back into CPR.|$|E
25|$|CSX is {{the only}} class I {{railroad}} serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its Boston Subdivision line to Springfield, and by <b>trackage</b> rights over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has <b>trackage</b> rights {{over much of the}} southern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a newly refurbished double stack intermodal yard in Worcester and a new transload facility in Westborough.|$|E
25|$|The D {{obtained}} <b>trackage</b> {{rights over}} the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad in 1886, extending {{the main line}} southwest from Scranton to Wilkes-Barre.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, {{detailed}} {{plans were}} created by the PSC. The plan was changed to not have the line run via IRT <b>trackage.</b> In having it run via its own <b>trackage,</b> the line could be operated by railroads other than the IRT as standard 10 foot-wide railroad cars could fit through the tunnels. To connect to Manhattan without using IRT <b>trackage</b> the line would use part of contracts given for other lines. The line would use the Manhattan Bridge–Revised route, which was approved in 1909 and was originally conceived to connect the IRT Brooklyn Line at Flatbush Avenue, east of the Nevins Street station, to the Canal Street Subway and the proposed Third Avenue Subway going both north and south under the Bowery. The tracks would have used both {{the north and south}} tracks on the Manhattan Bridge.|$|E
25|$|A small {{section of}} <b>trackage</b> was cut {{away from the}} ride prior to demolition. It will be {{preserved}} for posterity and displayed in a museum.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1995, BN and ATSF heads Gerald Grinstein and Robert D. Krebs both {{announced}} shareholders {{had approved}} the plan, which would save overhead costs and combine BN's coal and ATSF's intermodal strengths. Although {{the two systems}} complemented each other with little overlap, {{in contrast to the}} Santa Fe-Southern Pacific merger, which failed because it would have eliminated competition {{in many areas of the}} Southwest, BN and ATSF came to agreements with most other Class Is to keep them from opposing the merger. UP was satisfied with a single segment of <b>trackage</b> rights from Abilene, Kansas to Superior, Nebraska, which BN and ATSF had both served. KCS gained haulage rights to several Midwest locations, including Omaha, East St. Louis, and Memphis, in exchange for BNSF getting similar access to New Orleans. SP, initially requesting far-reaching <b>trackage</b> rights throughout the West, soon agreed on a reduced plan, whereby SP acquired <b>trackage</b> rights on ATSF for intermodal and automotive traffic to Chicago, and other <b>trackage</b> rights on ATSF in Kansas, south to Texas, and between Colorado and Texas. In exchange, SP assigned BNSF <b>trackage</b> rights over the former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad between El Paso and Topeka and haulage rights to the Mexican border at Eagle Pass, Texas. Regional Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway also obtained <b>trackage</b> rights over BN from Peoria to Galesburg, Illinois, a BN hub where it could interchange with SP (which had rights on BN dating from 1990). The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the BNSF merger on July 20, 1995 (with final approval on August 23), less than a month before UP announced on August 3 that it would acquire SP. Parents Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation were acquired on September 22, 1995 by the new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The merger of the operating companies was held up by issues with unions; ATSF merged on December 31, 1996 into BN, which was renamed the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{passenger}} train {{service on the}} CVRR ended in 1952, the last New York-Roanoke train ran in 1961. The PRR's successor, the Penn Central, closed all railway facilities in Chambersburg in 1972. Its successor, Conrail, first renamed what had been known as the Cumberland Valley Branch with three names: Shippensburg Secondary Track (Harrisburg to PENNROAD, south-east of Shippensburg); Hagerstown Secondary Track (from the Reading junction north-east of Shippensburg, through PENNROAD, to TOWN and HAGER towers in Hagerstown); and Winchester Secondary Track. Conrail later (1979–1980) abandoned the southern half of the Shippensburg Secondary (from {{the west side of}} Carlisle to Shippensburg, including street-running <b>trackage</b> on Earl St. in the latter town), opting instead to use the Reading connection for freight trains. Instrumental in this realignment was the placement of a wye track at CAPITOL interlocking in Harrisburg. Conrail also abandoned the <b>trackage</b> on the western portion of the CV bridge in Harrisburg, leaving a wye for Amtrak to turn power. The Winchester Secondary was sold to a short line. The Lurgan Branch name, originally used by Conrail for the ex-Reading <b>trackage</b> that passed through Shippensburg to a connection with the Western Maryland, was retained. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the <b>trackage</b> since the 1999 breakup of Conrail.|$|E
