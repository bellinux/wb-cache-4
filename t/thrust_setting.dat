50|$|On 16 July 2003, an Excel Airways Boeing 737-800 (G-XLAG) with 190 {{passengers}} and seven crew {{took off from}} Manchester Airport while vehicles were working {{near the end of}} the runway. Despite the crew being told the runway was operating at reduced length, they took off from a runway intersection with reduced length using a reduced <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> calculated for the assumed normal runway length. The aircraft lifted off over the vehicles, missing them by 56 ft, according to the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch report. Six safety recommendations were made.|$|E
5000|$|On some {{engines that}} are {{equipped}} with an afterburner the nozzle area is also varied during non-afterburning or dry thrust conditions. Typically the nozzle is fully open for starting and at idle. It may then close down as the thrust lever is advanced reaching its minimum area before or at the Military or max dry <b>thrust</b> <b>setting.</b> Two examples of this control are the General Electric J-79 and the Tumansky RD-33 in the MIG-29. Reasons for varying the nozzle area are explained in section [...] "Nozzle area control during dry operation".|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash revealed that the flight crew had used the incorrect speeds and <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> during the take-off attempt, with incorrect take-off data being calculated when preparing the flight (incorrect V speed calculation, {{as the result of}} the crew re-using a lighter take-off weight of 240,000 kg from the aircraft's previous take-off at Bradley, instead of the correct weight of 353,000 kg). The official report blamed the company for serious non-conformances to flight and duty time, with no regulations or company rules governing maximum duty periods for loadmasters and ground engineers, resulting in increased potential for fatigue-induced errors.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the first officer to push the correct button to engage the autothrottles at the {{beginning}} of the takeoff roll. He then manually advanced the throttles; the resultant delay and the slightly low <b>thrust</b> <b>set</b> on the left engine lengthened the airplane's ground roll and added to the directional control problem.|$|R
50|$|The 9th {{division}} initially {{planned to}} attack along the Benapol - Jessore axis. At Gen. Jacob's suggestion, the main <b>thrust</b> was <b>set</b> along the Boyra - Garibpur - Jessore axis while a secondary attack {{would be made}} along the Benapol - Jessore line.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the second}} approach, the crew again aborted and {{initiated}} another go around at {{a height of}} 220 meters and a distance of 4.5 km from the runway threshold. The vertical speed during that second go-around went as high as 20 mps, while engine <b>thrust</b> was <b>set</b> at the maximum TOGA limit of 101 - 102% (N1).|$|R
50|$|A typical {{civilian}} {{transport aircraft}} flight may illustrate {{the function of}} a FADEC. The flight crew first enters flight data such as wind conditions, runway length, or cruise altitude, into the flight management system (FMS). The FMS uses this data to calculate power settings for different phases of the flight. At takeoff, the flight crew advances the throttle to a predetermined setting, or opts for an auto-throttle takeoff if available. The FADECs now apply the calculated takeoff <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> by sending an electronic signal to the engines; {{there is no direct}} linkage to open fuel flow. This procedure can be repeated for any other phase of flight.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, pilots {{respect the}} {{inherent}} dangers of flying at low speeds at low altitude, and normally, a pilot would {{not attempt to}} fly an aircraft so close to stalling with the engines at flight idle (minimum <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> in flight). But in this instance, the pilots involved {{did not hesitate to}} fly the aircraft below its normal minimum flying speed because the purpose of the flyover was to demonstrate that the aircraft's computer systems would ensure that lift would always be available regardless of how the pilots handled the controls. The captain's previous experience of flying the aircraft type at the edge of its limits may have led to overconfidence and complacency.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust lever for the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the throttle control lever for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The throttle control lever for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle {{resembled a}} {{conventional}} light aircraft {{with the exception}} of two large airfoil-shaped cuffs over the wings intended to hold compressed Helium. The designer felt that using compressed helium would provide additional buoyancy, requiring less volume than an unpressurized dirigible. The exposed forward mounted engine was designed to tilt for forward or vertical <b>thrust.</b> A <b>set</b> of outrigger wheels on the wingtips were set for stability on the ground.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} {{of three different}} approaches to obtaining longitudinal trim for advanced fighter configurations with STOL performance are presented. The first, a differential thrust vectoring/reverser nozzle on an F- 15 model, was very effective with an increment in pitching moment generated by the 90 deg/ 50 deg nozzle at military power equal to that which would be produced by a change in horizontal tail deflection of 20 deg. This trim pitching moment {{was accompanied by a}} modest loss in lift. The second method involved a nose jet on a supersonic cruise fighter configuration which, when combined with some canard deflection and longitudinal instability, provided trim capability for the configuration with military power setting and main nozzles deflected 43 degrees. Finally, a blown-high-lift canard on an advanced fighter configuration indicated that trim could be obtained across the complete angle-of-attack range tested with <b>thrust</b> <b>set</b> at military power and the main nozzles deflected 40 degrees. There was no loss in configuration lift and a slight increase in longitudinal stability...|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} growth {{plan of the}} CDP consists of two components, a Strategic Economic <b>Thrust</b> (<b>SET)</b> for immediate implementation and a Future Growth Scenario, 2005-2025, for long-term application. Both of these were developed in mind of the region's economic strengths in manufacturing and services, with 60% of value-added manufacturing derived from electrical and electronic (E&E), chemical and chemical products (petrochemical, plastics, oleo chemicals) and food processing sub-sectors. A number of service and other manufacturing areas have emerged in support of these. The SET focuses on such factors as strengthening existing economic sectors and encouraging diversity, through incentives, stronger international ties, and proper allocation of resources and space. The Future Growth Scenario is aimed towards strengthening the economy internally and internationally by such factors as improvements in global transportation and developing manufacturing and service clusters. Also promoted by the Future Growth Scenario is the encouragement of the immigration of skilled, monied foreigners to help develop an international lifestyle attractive to foreign workers and investors. The targeted foreign and local investments for the IM is US$ 100 billion.|$|R
50|$|The {{velocity}} of the gas leaving a convergent nozzle may be subsonic or sonic (Mach 1) at low flight speeds or supersonic (Mach 3.0 at SR-71 cruise) for a con-di nozzle at higher speeds where the nozzle pressure ratio is increased with the intake ram.The nozzle thrust is highest if the static pressure of the gas reaches the ambient value as it leaves the nozzle. This only happens if the nozzle exit area is the correct value for the nozzle pressure ratio (npr). Since the npr changes with engine <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> and flight speed this is seldom the case. Also at supersonic speeds the divergent area is less than required to give complete internal expansion to ambient pressure as a trade-off with external body drag. Whitford gives the F-16 as an example. Other underexpanded examples were the XB-70 and SR-71.|$|E
5000|$|The {{auditorium}} is 8.5m {{high and}} 11m2 with a retractable seating bank {{on all four}} sides. Each bank seats 60 people and the seat cushions and backrests can be removed to create alternative playing areas. With the upstage, left and right banks retracted, the downstage centre bank can be pulled out from the standard four rows to 10 rows, creating an end-on configuration. The stage measures 6.6m x 8.6m in <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> and 6.6m x 5.9m in-the-round.Upstage, a series of trapdoors span {{the width of the}} stage with a series or movable and replaceable panels covering them. Under the stage is a large manually winched lift (now out of service) which can roll along the span of the traps. Although these could be used for stage effects, original plans show this sub-stage area marked as a [...] "chair store" [...] and was to be used as the storage area for seats removed when reconfiguring the space.|$|E
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{launched}} a full {{investigation into the}} accident, which included a three-day public hearing in Albany on April 25 through April 27, 1972, and a deposition in Washington, D.C. on May 19, 1972. Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the wreckage, and their recorded data {{was found to be}} intact and usable. The investigation revealed that as the flight crew attempted to reduce thrust on the left engine during the final approach, they were unable to remove the 'cruise pitch lock' mechanism that is used to maintain a cruise <b>thrust</b> <b>setting.</b> When they subsequently attempted to perform an emergency feathering and shutdown procedure on that engine, they were able to shut down the engine but unable to achieve a feathering of the propeller. This eventually resulted in the left propeller creating a high amount of asymmetric drag while windmilling; so much so, that the other engine operating at full power was not able to arrest the resulting uncontrollable descent.|$|E
40|$|We reanalyzed 3 D seismic {{reflection}} and logging-while-drilling {{data from the}} toe of the northern Barbados accretionary prism to interpret structure, deformation, and fluid flow related to subduction processes. The seafloor amplitude and coherence reveal an abrupt change in the thrust orientation from NNE at the thrust front and north and NNW about 5 km west of the thrust front. These <b>thrust</b> <b>sets</b> are separated by a triangular-shaped quiet area, which may represent a zone of low strength. The northeast-trending band of strong negative amplitude and high coherence in the décollement, known to be an interval of arrested consolidation, overlaps the quiet area, suggesting that the arrested consolidation {{may be related to}} the lack of thrust imbrication, and thus, vertical drainage for fluid in the accretionary prism. Fractal analysis of the décollement and top of the subducting oceanic basement indicates that the relief of the décollement correlates with the topography of the oceanic basement. Differential compaction of the underthrust sediment overlying the rugged oceanic basement, together with the basement faults that penetrate into the décollement probably caused relief or even faulting in the décollement...|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} a structural analysis and a stratigraphic {{revision of the}} sedimentary successions of the Ligurian Accretionary Complex (LAC) cropping out in the southern Apennines along the boundary between Campania, Lucania and Calabria regions. Two fold and <b>thrust</b> <b>sets</b> characterize the progressive deformation related to the Lower Miocene inclusion of these successions in the tectonic accretionary wedge. A third deformation stage, affecting also the Middle-Upper Miocene unconformable wedge-top basin deposits, is associated to the thrust front eastward migration. In this orogenic phase the Apennine thrust sheet pile, formed by LAC and Apennine Platform Units, tectonically covered the successions located in the westernmost sector of the Lagonegro-Molise Basin. Finally a Pliocene-Middle Pleistocene regional fold set deformed the whole orogenic prism as consequence of a thick-skinned tectonics expressed by means of deeply rooted thrusts in the buried Apulian Platform carbonates. Maghrebian Flysch Basin and LAC successions show a similar stratigraphy indicating continuity between paleogeographic basin domains, {{as well as between}} the Paleogene-Lower Miocene succession of Sicilide Unit and the corresponding deposits of Lagonegro-Molise Basin as consequence of drowning of the interposed Panormide Platform starting from the uppermost Cretaceous...|$|R

Reverse thrust is {{typically}} applied immediately after touchdown, often along with spoilers, to improve deceleration {{early in the}} landing roll when residual aerodynamic lift and high speed limit {{the effectiveness of the}} brakes located on the landing gear. Reverse thrust is always selected manually, either using levers attached to the thrust levers or moving the thrust levers into a reverse thrust 'gate'.|$|R
40|$|Reduced thrust takeoff has the {{potential}} to reduce aircraft-related NO X emissions at airports, however this remains to be investigated using flight data. This paper analyses the effect of takeoff roll <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> variability on the magnitude and spatial distribution of NO X emissions using high-resolution data records for 497 Airbus A 319 activities at London Heathrow. <b>Thrust</b> <b>setting</b> varies between 67 and 97 % of maximum, and aircraft operating in the bottom 10 th percentile emit on average 514 g less NO X per takeoff roll (32 % reduction) than the top 10 th percentile, however this is dependent on takeoff roll duration. Spatial analysis suggests that peak NO X emissions, corresponding {{to the start of the}} takeoff roll, can be reduced by up to 25 % by adopting reduced thrust takeoff activities. Furthermore, the length of the emission source also decreases. Consequently, the use of reduced thrust takeoff may enable improved local air quality at airports...|$|E
40|$|Although {{chemical}} rocket propulsion {{is widely used}} in space transportation, large amounts of propellant mass limit designs for spacecraft missions to Mars. Electrical propulsion, which requires a smaller propellant load, is an alternative propulsion system {{that can be used}} for interplanetary flight. After the recent successes of the NASA Deep Space 1 spacecraft and the ESA SMART 1 spacecraft, which incorporate an electrical propulsion system, there is a strong need for trajectory tools to support these systems. This thesis describes the optimization of interplanetary trajectories from Earth to Mars for spacecraft utilizing low-thrust electrical propulsion systems. It is assumed that the controls are the thrust direction and the <b>thrust</b> <b>setting.</b> Specifically, the minimum time and minimum propellant problems are studied and solutions are computed with the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm (SGRA). The results indicate that, when the thrust direction and <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> are simultaneously optimized, the minimum time and minimum propellant solutions are not identical. For minimum time, it is found that the <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> must be at the maximum value; also, the thrust direction has a normal component with a switch at midcourse from upward to downward. This changes the curvature of the trajectory, has a beneficial effect on time, but a detrimental effect on propellant mass; indeed, the propellant mass ratio of the minimum time solution is about twice that of the Hohmann transfer solution. Thus, the minimum time solution yields a rather inefficient trajectory. For minimum propellant consumption, it is found that the best <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> is bang-zero-bang (maximum thrust, followed by coasting, followed by maximum thrust) and that the best thrust direction is tangent to the trajectory. This is a rather efficient trajectory; to three significant digits, the associated mass ratio is the same as that of the Hohmann transfer solution, even for thrust-to-weight ratios of order 10 - 4. For a robotic spacecraft, it is clear that the minimum propellant mass solution is to be preferred. For a manned spacecraft, the transfer time and propellant mass functionals have comparable importance; they are in conflict with one another for the following reason: any attempt at reducing the former increases the latter and viceversa. This suggests the construction of a compromise functional, which is the linear combination of the previous two functionals, suitably scaled. The compromise functional depends on a parameter C (compromise factor) in the range 0 ≤ C ≤ 1 and is such that it reduces to the transfer time functional for C = 0 and to the propellant mass functional for C = 1.

40|$|International audienceGround-based {{aircraft}} trajectory {{prediction is}} a major concern in air traffic management. A safe and efficient prediction is a prerequisite for the implementation of automated tools that detect and solve conflicts between trajectories. This paper focuses on the climb phase because predictions are less accurate in this phase. The Eurocontrol BADA 1 model, as a total energy model, relies on the prediction of energy rate. In a kinetic model, this energy rate comes from the power provided by the forces applied to the aircraft. Computing these forces requires knowledge of the aircraft state (mass, airspeed, etc), atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature) and aircraft intent (maximum climb thrust or reduced climb thrust, for example). Some of this information like the mass and <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> are not available to ground-based systems. In this paper, we try to infer an equivalent weight and an equivalent thrust profile. These parameters are not meant to be true, however they are designed to improve the energy rate prediction. One common <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> profile for all the trajectories is built. This thrust profile is designed {{in such a way that}} the estimated equivalent weight provides a good energy rate prediction. We have compared the energy rate prediction using these equivalent parameters and BADA standard parameters...|$|E

40|$|The total climate, {{air quality}} and health impact of {{aircraft}} black carbon (BC) emissions depends on quantity (mass and number concentration), {{as well as}} morphology (fractal dimension and surface area) of emitted BC aggregates. This study examines multiple BC emission metrics from a gas turbine with a double annular combustor, CFM 56 - 5 B 4 - 2 P. As {{a part of the}} SAMPLE III. 2 campaign, concurrent measurements of particle mobility, particle mass, particle number concentration and mass concentration, as well as collection of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples, allowed for characterization of the BC emissions. Mass- and number-based emission indices were strongly influenced by <b>thrust</b> <b>setting</b> during pilot combustion and ranged from less than 1 to 208 mg/kg-fuel and 3710 ^ 12 to 3710 ^ 16 particles/kg-fuel, respectively.

Using aggregation and sintering theory with empirical effective density relationships, a power law relationship between primary particle diameter and mobility diameter is presented.
