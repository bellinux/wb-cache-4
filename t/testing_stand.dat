500|$|The C5 was {{produced}} in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work {{was carried out by}} a small team of people in a sealed room, but as production ramped up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by an underground tunnel. A rolling <b>testing</b> <b>stand</b> was located {{at the end of the}} production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing [...] and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> for thermal diffusivity measurement based on Ångström's method (called TIMAwave™). The concept of the <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> has been proved by FE simulation and experiments on standard samples. The <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> has been realized and integrated into the hardware of the already existing <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> LaTIMA™, which was developed for the measurement of thermal conductivity of highly conductive materials. The combination of these two <b>test</b> <b>stands</b> in one device is a great advantage, since the diffusivity and the conductivity of a sample can be measured at one specimen in one device. The results allow the calculation of the specific heat capacity or the density of the sample. Several materials have been characterized by using the new <b>test</b> <b>stand.</b> Some selected results will be discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to calibrate and verify of the software Virtual <b>Testing</b> <b>Stand</b> of the Car Cabin using climatic chamber tests. The Virtual <b>Testing</b> <b>Stand</b> is standalone executable software developed in Matlab for prediction of the cabin environment and thermal heat load by using the time-efficient heat balance model. The main limitation of the simulation method is a simplified convection scheme inside a cabin using the empirical correlations instead of the CFD simulations. In this paper we present the first preliminary tests of the calibration process and verification of the simulation results. Tests were carried out for the car Skoda Octavia Combi with the silver metallic paint. The material composition of the test car was deeply explored and the material properties of the cabin were identified as accurate as possible. The car was exposed to the various environments inside a climate chamber. In this paper we report about two performed tests: summer solar soak test and winter heat-up test with the defined heat source...|$|E
