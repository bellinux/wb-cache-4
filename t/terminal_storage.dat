50|$|The <b>Terminal</b> <b>Storage</b> Warehouse District {{is located}} at Medford and Terminal Streets in the Charlestown {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts. It includes three large brick warehouse buildings which were built between 1910 and 1913. They are rare surviving elements of the commercial development of the Charlestown waterfront early in the 20th century. They were built by two separate companies which had common ownership. The buildings at 40 and 50 Terminal Street were built by the Terminal Wharf & Railroad Warehouse Company, and that at 267-281 Medford Street was built by the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Storage</b> Warehouse Company. They were built to serve as storage facilities for the transhipment by rail and ship of goods through the port.

50|$|Vilmos Voigt from Loránd-Eötvös {{university}} (Budapest) {{proposed the}} installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around the <b>terminal</b> <b>storage</b> location. After a certain time span new signs with translations would be installed, but the old signs would not be removed. Newer signs would be posted {{farther away from the}} location, thus the warning would be understandable as languages change and {{it would be possible to}} understand the older languages through the translation.|$|E
5000|$|Polish science-fiction author Stanisław Lem {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} artificial satellites that would transmit information from their orbit to Earth for millennia. [...] He also described a biological coding of DNA in a mathematical sense, which would reproduce itself automatically.

The DNA of the so-called atomic flowers would contain the necessary data about both the location and its contents.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, {{he walked}} around the East Village around Tompkins Square Park bragging {{to some of the}} people he {{believed}} were his disciples that he had killed his roommate and girlfriend, Monika Beerle, a Swiss student at the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, and a dancer at Billy's Topless. By his own confession, he dismembered her body in the bathtub, boiled the parts, and served some of her remains {{in the form of a}} soup to the homeless in nearby Tompkins Square Park. He said that he had boiled her head and made soup from her brain. He had tasted it and liked it, and thereafter he referred to himself as a cannibal. At least one of the people to whom he told his tale went to police. Rakowitz was arrested shortly thereafter, and led the police to the Port Authority Bus <b>Terminal</b> <b>storage</b> area, where he had stored her skull and teeth.|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} {{objectives}} of the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) water supply management program are {{to cope with a}} failure of the aqueducts in the Delta due to earthquake and flood damage and to mitigate periodic shortages. EBMUD emphasizes construction of additional <b>terminal</b> <b>storage,</b> specifically development of a reservoir in Buckhorn Canyon, to meet both objectives. Better alternatives [...] cheaper and less environmentally damaging [...] are (to cope with failure) use of existing <b>terminal</b> <b>storage</b> and interties, along with an eventual phased construction of secure aqueducts in the Delta, and (to mitigate shortages) purchase of high quality Mokelumne River water from the nearby Woodbridge Irrigation District, along with sharply rising block rates to induce conservation by EBMUD customers. Additional <b>terminal</b> <b>storage,</b> only as a last resort, would better come from some marginal addition to capacity at the planned Los Vaqueros Reservoir rather than construction of a new reservoir in Buckhorn Canyon. Under plausible assumptions, the cost of providing high quality water during a shortage is 10 times as high under the Buckhorn option as it would be with water purchases and conservation...|$|E
