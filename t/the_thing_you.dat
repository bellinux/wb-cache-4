Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E

500|$|Castle Rock {{offered to}} finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously {{considered}} the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his {{standing in the}} industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway. But, he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, [...] "you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> set out to do". Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus {{a percentage of the}} net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential. He added [...] "I may say, 'Yo, I like this song,' but if Ari or Phil say it's the corniest shit they've ever heard, I trust them. And the other way around. We all know when we're onto something...We also know when something's not jelling. And that's <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> pray you will always have. You can't believe that everything you do is hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 147 {{reveals a}} paradox within the poet, {{and perhaps the}} {{population}} at large, between desiring the exact sin or ill which makes one sickly, unstable, or less completely whole as an individual, and knowing <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> desire, {{in this case the}} poet's mistress, is the very thing causing trouble. Scholar Don Paterson, like many other Shakespearean scholars, have proposed this particular sonnet was in part inspired by an ending passage in The Old Arcadia written by Sir Phillip Sydney, which reads, [...] "Sicke to the death, still loving my disease".|$|E

Even {{if you happen to}} bump right into it, {{how will you}} know it is <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> didn't know?" [...] Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the {{canonical}} statement of the paradox: [...] " [...] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, {{there is no need to}} search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Tezuka's arms swelled up and {{he became}} ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which {{made him want to}} be a doctor. [...] At a {{crossing}} point, he asked his mother whether he should look into doing manga full-time or whether he should become a doctor. At the time, being a manga author was not a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: [...] "You should work doing <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> like most of all." [...] Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as Black Jack.|$|E
