25|$|Rickles {{appeared}} in the popular Beach Party film series. He recalled in his 2007 memoir that at a White House dinner, Barbara Bush <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about his decision to appear in those films. Rickles' agent, Jack Gilardi, was married to Annette Funicello when Rickles was cast in the Beach Party films. He subsequently began appearing more frequently on television talk shows, first appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1965.|$|E
25|$|In a segment, Green went to {{the press}} conference of Grey Owl where he serenaded and kissed Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan, {{thinking}} Green was a journalist, advised him {{not to give up}} his day job. Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about this often and once gave out Humplik's office phone number on the air.|$|E

Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{is said to}} have disliked {{his younger}} brother, Charles, and to have <b>teased</b> <b>him,</b> {{although}} this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry snatched the hat off a bishop {{and put it on the}} younger child's head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.|$|E
500|$|She <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> {{about the}} name Bull Banks and his {{sensitivity}} {{to less than}} genteel expressions: [...] "One thinks nothing of bulls and tups in the farming world; but after you objected to cigars {{it occurred to me}} to wonder." [...] There were no objections, and the tale was finished in July.|$|E

500|$|Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's {{first choice}} {{to portray the}} character. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{eventually}} received the role. Due {{to the fact that}} Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes. Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean, Morgan was surprised when he was asked to reprise the role. Ackles and Jared Padalecki often <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about the age difference during filming. Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, [...] "It pissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience watching, because none of us really knew where we were gonna go." [...] However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.|$|E
500|$|Barbirolli's {{repertoire}} {{was not as}} wide as that of many of {{his colleagues}} because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> for his meticulousness: [...] "We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events." [...] Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, [...] "it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade." [...] He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{also had}} a dark fantasy life: he {{performed}} rites with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> and asked why he {{did not try to}} kiss his teacher, he replied: [...] "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first." [...] He also recalled that as a little boy, he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. Kemper stated in later interviews that as a child some of his favorite games to play were [...] "Gas Chamber" [...] and [...] "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had two near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.|$|E

When Valentine's Day comes around, though, Yūji receives {{a box of}} handmade chocolates. The name on card can be read multiple ways, the most common way being Masayuki Ikari (Ikari Masayuki), a male name, so his friends <b>tease</b> <b>him</b> throughout the day until it's time to meet the person who sent the chocolates at the front gate after school.|$|R
2500|$|Tan Su Lin, a {{journalist}} for Astro Awani {{was sitting in}} front of Noramfaizul on the front, right-hand corner of the four-wheel-drive vehicle.

I didn't expect it to end this way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weld has a {{sense of}} humor about his background; when Massachusetts Senate {{president}} Billy Bulger publicly <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about his all-American heritage and wealth, pointing out that his ancestors had come over on the Mayflower, Weld rose on the dais with a correction: [...] "Actually, they weren't on the Mayflower. They sent the servants over first to get the cottage ready." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyell {{was troubled}} both by Huxley's belligerence {{and by the}} {{question}} of ape ancestry, but got little sympathy from Darwin who <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "Our ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim bladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull, and undoubtedly was a hermaphrodite! Here is a pleasant genealogy for mankind." [...] Lyell began work on a book examining human origins.|$|E

[...] "My father said, 'Nick, get a trade, be a barber or {{something}}.' I said, 'But, Pop, I {{want to do}} something where I can make lots of money. You can't make lots of money with just a trade.'" [...] After a year of unpaid acting in New York, Adams hitchiked to Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Darin {{moved to}} the Bronx early in his life (with a rented summer home in Staten Island) and {{graduated}} from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science. In later years he attributed his arrogance to his experiences there, where {{he was surrounded by}} brighter students who <b>teased</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He then enrolled at Hunter College and soon gravitated to the drama department. After only two semesters, he dropped out to pursue an acting career.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Catherine Deneuve has {{provided}} another anecdote illustrating {{this aspect of}} Buñuel's style: while shooting Tristana, {{he had told her}} frequently of the distaste he felt for the [...] "touristy" [...] side of Toledo, where the film was made, so she <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about one crane shot that brought out the beauty of the surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from a dolly with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the [...] "obviously" [...] beautiful.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien, taking {{advantage}} of the furor, likened the Tories to the children who <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> {{when he was a boy}} in Shawinigan. [...] "When I was a kid people were laughing at me," [...] he said at an appearance in Nova Scotia. [...] "But I accepted that because God gave me other qualities and I'm grateful." [...] The speech, which one Tory described as one Chrétien had waited his whole life to deliver, moved many in the audience to tears. Chrétien's approval ratings shot up, nullifying the only advantage the Tories still had over him.|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{learned to}} read Butler's body {{language}} and he was getting a little nervous as we flew {{deeper and deeper into}} Iraqi territory. The reality of what we were about to do had begun to hit him. Duelfer <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about how the Iraqis could solve everything if they just shot us out of the sky. Butler was not amused. He kept asking probing questions, reassuring himself that these inspection targets were of a legitimate disarmament character. [...] "What makes us go to that site?" [...] he asked. How do I explain it to the Iraqis?...How do I explain this site to the Security Council?...What do we expect to find at this one?...What happens if the Iraqis stop us from entering?" ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sean Hughes {{left his}} {{long-term}} {{role as a}} team captain on Never Mind the Buzzcocks in 2002, Bailey became his successor. His style quickly blended into the show, possibly helped by his background in music. He soon developed a rapport with host Mark Lamarr, who continually <b>teased</b> <b>him</b> about his looks and his pre-occupation with woodland animals. It was announced on 18 September 2008 that Bailey would leave the series and {{be replaced by a}} series of guest captains including Jack Dee and Dermot O'Leary. While touring in 2009, Bailey joked that the main reason for leaving the show was a lack of desire to continue humming Britney Spears' Toxic to little known figures in the indie music scene. During this time he also left his position as [...] "curator" [...] of the Museum of Curiosity, and declared his intention to [...] "retire" [...] from panel games, although he has since appeared on QI many more times and hosted Have I Got News For You.|$|E
