5|$|Marcus Tullius Cicero (January 3, 106 BC – December 7, 43 BC) was an Ancient Roman {{philosopher and}} politician, {{famous for his}} oratory skills. He came from a wealthy {{municipal}} family of the Roman equestrian order, and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators, {{and one of the}} premier prose stylists during the Golden Age of Latin. Tullia (August 5, 79 BC or 78 BC – February 45 BC), Cicero's daughter, died in the winter of 45 BC after giving birth to her second son; this caused Cicero <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> period of deep mourning.|$|E

Charlie appears to Brax again and he explains that he is tired of fighting. He wishes to remain with her, saying that his brothers no longer need him. Charlie tries to encourage Brax to go back and asks him about Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen). She realises that Brax loves Ricky and tells him to let go, so he can return to her.|$|E

Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{validate}} the proposed aircraft's design, and to explore its flight handling characteristics, Fairchild Republic contracted with Ames Industries of Bohemia, New York to build a flyable 62% scale version. Burt Rutan's Rutan Aircraft Factory (RAF) in Mojave, California was contracted to perform the flight test evaluations, with test pilot Dick Rutan doing the flying. The scale version was known at RAF as the Model 73 NGT, this flying on 10 September 1981. One requirement was for the aircraft to be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spin, but to also have easy recovery from the spin. This was demonstrated using the Model 73 NTG.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Second World War, professional wrestling in New Zealand became extremely popular reaching a high point in the 1950s. The death of longtime Dominion Wrestling Union promoter Walter Miller in 1959, however, caused the promotion <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slump as appearances from foreign wrestlers dwindled to only a small few each year. Steve Rickard, one of its rising stars, continued to run the DWU {{for two years before}} starting his own promotion, All Star Pro-Wrestling, in 1962. Another New Zealand wrestler, John da Silva, started a short-lived rival promotion called the Central Wrestling Association which operated up until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The German film industry, {{which was}} {{protected}} {{during the war}} by the ban on foreign films import, became exposed {{at the end of}} the war to the international film industry while having to face an embargo, this time on its own films. Many countries banned the import of German films and audiences themselves were resisting anything that was “German”. In addition, the economic situation was unstable and the devaluation of the currency made it difficult for the smaller production companies to function. Film industry financing was a fragile business and expensive productions occasionally led to bankruptcy. In 1925 UFA itself was forced <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> disadvantageous partnership called Parufamet with the American studios Paramount and MGM, before being taken over by the nationalist industrialist and newspaper owner Alfred Hugenberg in 1927.|$|E

Scores were higher then than in earlier times and matches were tending <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second day. In 1770, a Sussex lawyer called John Baker left an account in his diary of a match between Hambledon and the Surrey club Coulsdon which lasted two days. Baker came from Chichester, a journey of twenty miles taking four hours on horseback. He wrote how he went to Petersfield for overnight accommodation. Baker wrote about the very large crowds which gathered at these matches and the good business done by vendors on site.|$|E

25|$|The band {{released}} many demos and EPs {{in their}} early days when playing the London circuit in the UK. With every batch of new songs that The Subways would compose, Lunn would insist that the band record them. However, {{at such a young}} age the group had no money with which <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> studio to record consistently, so they came upon the idea of buying their own cheap recording system at home. Eventually, the band had their own website, http://www.thesubways.net, which Lunn himself constructed and maintained, where they put all their new songs. Through the use of their own home recording system they now had roughly eight demos worth of songs both on the internet and being sent out to local and London promoters at various venues. The Subways then began touring in the local and London area playing regularly at the Buffalo Bar in Highbury and Islington.|$|E

When Walt realizes Jesse is with Hank, he tries to call off the deal to protect Hank, but is subdued by Hank and Gomez. Just then, Jack and his men arrive and fire on the group, killing Hank, despite Walt's repeated protest. Jack's men take all but one barrel of Walt's money and abduct Jesse; as Jesse is taken away, Walt spitefully tells him that he watched Jane die.|$|E
