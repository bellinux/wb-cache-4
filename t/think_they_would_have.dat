500|$|In 1899, that {{prediction}} suddenly came true. At {{the age of}} forty-two, Elgar {{produced the}} Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, [...] "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... {{that is to say}} I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work [...] "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is [...] "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The website BuzzFeed {{interviewed a}} man named Ray, who {{was a friend of}} Mess and an {{acquaintance}} of Tsarnaev. Ray said: Tam wasn't there at the memorial service, he wasn't at the funeral, he wasn't around at all... And he was really close with Brendan. That's why it's so weird when he said, 'I don't have any American friends.' Ray continued: [...] "He was somebody who was in contact with Brendan on a daily basis. Anybody like that you would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been around." [...] Ray did not have any further contact with Tsarnaev after the murders.|$|E

6000|$|... "It may be so, Sam. But if {{they had}} come to rob, don't you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{returned}} to their ship without captives or booty?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is likely}} that the Indians and desperadoes were much chagrined to <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to hold off for two days, but if so they made no sign.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lynched him?" [...] {{asked the}} New Yorker, {{in the next}} seat of the ferry station, who was also waiting for the boat.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, yes,” {{admitted}} the aunt lamely, “but I don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> run quite so fast to her help {{if they had}} not liked her so much.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{the people}} saw and pursued {{me because of}} the death of that accursed snake. Had I not run fast and escaped them, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to thank}} you for all you've done for my sake, Mary. I know how good you have been to my people; it was very kind of you. I cannot <b>think</b> how <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> got along without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but just}} <b>think</b> what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been without a family genius, {{if they are}} what they are with one! Besides, the prophecies are really responsible," [...] he added, with the air of one who says, [...] "I have a partner--Mr. Jorkins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{learned by}} this time that if they don't bother me, I won't bother them, he muttered as he rolled over a stone to look for fat beetles. [...] "Somehow, folks never seem to {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> me, {{for every}} body there is grown up, and father {{seems to have}} a wish for me to be with this Aunt Lilias, because she has a schoolroom.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} {{returned}} from Paris; the first time I have been out; and, {{had it not been}} for you,' she added, 'I should not have been here to-night. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> put me in prison.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{bought a}} country house, a sober sportsman's life, and the liking of honest friends. Well, your {{investments}} were sound, {{but there are}} men of other temperaments they mightn't satisfy. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> satisfied Rupert Wyndham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> backed down, if we {{had been}} busy with Boers, Chinese, and black men. They were at fever heat as it was; and we could have done nothing, {{if we had}} had two hundred and fifty {{thousand}} men engaged at the Cape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{fasten the}} {{shutters}} pretty securely," [...] Fergus went on. [...] "They are three inches of solid oak, {{and you see}} these bars are all riveted at each end. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{plenty of time to}} cut the rivet heads off, before any army could approach." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} boys were {{inclined}} {{to think that the}} old scout was mistaken--that they could ride as far as anybody. But when, shortly after sunset, they came within sight of Hank Leeson's place both were glad to <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to ride no more for the present.|$|R
6000|$|The child seemed puzzled. [...] "I don't know" [...] she said, after a {{thoughtful}} pause. [...] "Father says the Turks are far, far worst; but mother and I fear them both; {{they are so}} fierce--so very fierce. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed us if father had been away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tony smiled curiously. “That man {{has good}} taste. I liked him,” he said. “Well, {{there is one}} of the Sin Verguenza who will never march again. I wonder if you {{remember}} that two of our family once fought with the Legitimatists in Spain. Still, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked down upon the Sin Verguenza.” ...|$|E
60|$|It {{took two}} porters {{as well as}} the driver to hold him in at the station; and I do not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it, even then, had not one of the men had the {{presence}} of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose, and to light a bit of brown paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Stefan," [...] she whispered, [...] "what {{a narrow}} escape! It makes me tremble to <b>think</b> of it. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> shot you, my Stefan!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he did us yeoman service," [...] the archer said warmly, [...] "though I <b>think</b> {{not that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> carried the {{barricade}} had they fought till morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Lions, my boy,' I said; 'they are {{hunting down}} by the river there; but I don't think that you need make {{yourself}} uneasy. We have been here three nights now, and {{if they were going to}} pay us a visit I <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done so before this. However, we will make up the fire.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a {{superior}} man there! Our funds are low, {{and we must}} not look for great attainments at present. It is easy to cram a man if he is intelligent; I only want a person who can keep up what is taught, and manage the reading-room on nights when we are not there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been nearly fifteen miles shorter. But if they pursued they would not come that way, because {{they would not be}} able to get across. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go round and ford the river some miles higher than you did. They could never swim across with their guns and {{ammunition}} to carry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a {{time when}} I could have warned them in San Roque, though I {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> listened to me. Now I do not know that I would do it if I had the opportunity." [...] His voice grew sterner. [...] "They have brought it upon themselves. There are iniquities which can not be borne." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{small town}} {{the movie is}} set in is prosperous and does not show any salient social or {{economic}} problems and the teacher practices a liberal lifestyle. Gansel {{is convinced that the}} plot gains a broader psychological validity by the choice of such a location. “Everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been Anne Franks and Sophie Scholls in Nazi Germany. In my opinion this is complete nonsense. I would say that biographies of resistance rather originate in coincidences,” claims Gansel. He then explains that, for example, Karo’s political awareness and opposition arise out of vanity: she does not like the white shirt. In the past Gansel had been sure that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been part of the resistance but while working on The Wave he realized how “non-politically” the conversion of people took place. He remarks that every human being has the need for belonging to a group.|$|R
5000|$|A December 1991 Toronto Star article {{remarked that}} twelve months earlier, the Barenaked Ladies [...] "were virtual unknowns. Today, they're one of Canada's most popular acts. <b>Think</b> how far <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone with songs like 'Be My Yoko Ono' if this indie {{cassette}} EP {{had been a}} real album, with big-money marketing behind it." ...|$|R
60|$|When the Boolooroo's {{people were}} armed with long, thin, lances of bluewood all {{sharpened}} to fine points at one end, they prepared to march once more against the invaders. Their sticks {{were twice as}} long as those of the Pinkies, and the Boolooroo chuckled with glee to <b>think</b> what fun <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> in punching holes in the round, fat bodies of his enemies.|$|R
6000|$|Allonby {{did not see}} the snare. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I am not {{an admirer}} of Clavering, but I'm willing to admit that he has done {{everything}} he could; in fact, I'm 'most astonished they have stood him so long, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done so, but for Larry. Anyway, it's comforting to know Larry is rapidly making himself unpopular among them." ...|$|E
60|$|I spoke calmly, but {{my heart}} was thumping with {{excitement}} and resentment. The apprehension of the untried is apt to be sharp at such moments, and I looked for them to turn their backs upon me for an impertinent provincial. Indeed, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> all save Comyn, {{had it not been}} for Fox himself. He lighted a pipe, smiled, and began easily, quite dispassionately, to address me.|$|E
6000|$|... "----and this {{incident}} did not damage his credit with her. However, after the little waif had been sufficiently petted and praised to gratify Master Marmaduke's paternal feelings, they came home, and, instead of holding their tongues, {{began to tell}} all our people what a dear little child Marmaduke had, and how they considered that it {{ought not to be}} made to suffer for his follies. In fact, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> adopted it, if I had allowed them." ...|$|E
60|$|Think I {{have many}} thoughts; I {{think there may}} be birdlime here for me; I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> fain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> me from the realm; I think the Queen may never bear a child; I think that I may be some time the Queen, Then, Queen indeed: no foreign prince or priest Should fill my throne, myself upon the steps. I think I will not marry anyone, Specially not this landless Philibert Of Savoy; but, if Philip menace me, I think that I will play with Philibert, As once the Holy Father did with mine, Before my father married my good mother,-- For fear of Spain.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Michael Stein," [...] {{said another}} old friend, named Gobelin, [...] "you wouldn't have your {{children}} disgraced, would you? <b>think</b> how sheepish <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked, hiding {{themselves in the}} smithy here, when all the other young men were parading round the green with the guns and swords they have taken from the rebels, and the women and girls all admiring them. Why, neighbour, not {{a girl in the}} parish <b>would</b> <b>have</b> spoken to them." ...|$|R
60|$|None of my {{servants}} {{had been}} left on the place, and the maid {{who came to the}} door informed me that Mr. Vincent had gone to New York that morning, and that Mrs. Vincent and her daughter were out driving. I ventured to ask if she thought <b>they</b> <b>would</b> soon return, and she answered that she did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gone to Rock Lake, which, from the way they talked about it, must be a long way off.|$|R
