In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games.

5|$|During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing {{more than}} half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the side. In county matches, Hutton {{averaged}} 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In {{the early part of the}} tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the impact}} was far greater <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications {{went far beyond}} New Guinea.

Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs.

Rolle also posted averages of 8.4 rebounds per game, third in the WAC (behind Luke Babbitt of Nevada and Chis Oakes of San Jose State), and 13.9 points per game, 12th in the WAC. His field goal percentage was 51.1, tied with Babbitt for third in conference and behind Tai Wesley of Utah State and Ike Okoye of Boise State.
