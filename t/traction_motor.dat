5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{technology}} transfer include Mitsubishi Electric’s MT205 <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and ATM9 transformer to CSR Zhuzhou Electric, Hitachi’s YJ92A <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and Alstom’s YJ87A <b>Traction</b> <b>motor</b> to CNR Yongji Electric, Siemens’ TSG series pantograph to Zhuzhou Gofront Electric. Most {{of the components}} of the CRH trains manufactured by Chinese companies were from local suppliers, with only a few parts imported.|$|E
50|$|Some were {{originally}} delivered with experimental Siemens <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{to test the}} <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> that would be later found in R160Bs. These cars were eventually refitted with the Bombardier MITRAC <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> found on all other R143s.|$|R

50|$|During rebuilding, all bogies and <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{underwent}} a complete refurbishment. <b>Traction</b> <b>motors</b> were tested back-to-back to ensure quality.|$|R
25|$|Most 567C {{locomotive}} models used D37B {{traction motors}} until mid 1959 when the D47B <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> {{was used in}} production locomotives. Very early 567C locomotives from 1953 used the D27B <b>traction</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{field winding}} of each <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> is {{connected}} across the main generator.|$|E
25|$|The {{prime mover}} RPM is {{increased}} {{and the main}} generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> fields.|$|E
50|$|Bird-nesting due to {{overspeed}} {{can occur}} either in operating <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> of powered locomotives or in <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> of dead-in-consist locomotives being transported within a train traveling too fast. Another cause is replacement of worn or damaged <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> with units incorrectly geared for the application.|$|R
50|$|By March 2015, {{all of the}} {{original}} Siemens-powered GTO-VVVF <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> were replaced with new IGBT-VVVF <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> manufactured by Toyo Denki.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} 3100's the {{traction}} for the locomotives is from six DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{comes from the}} 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a rectifier bridge {{for use by the}} <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{armature}} of each <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> {{is connected}} across a forced-air-cooled resistance grid (the dynamic braking grid) {{in the roof}} of the locomotive's hood.|$|E
25|$|Application of {{hydrostatic}} transmissions {{are generally}} limited to small shunting locomotives and rail maintenance equipment, {{as well as}} being used for non-tractive applications in diesel engines such as drives for <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> fans.|$|E
25|$|EMD's headquarters, {{engineering}} {{facilities and}} parts manufacturing operations {{are based in}} McCook, Illinois, while its final locomotive assembly line is located in Muncie, Indiana. EMD also operates a <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> maintenance, rebuild and overhaul facility in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} C40-9W <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> cannot {{fit in the}} narrower trucks. To {{achieve the}} same total power, more of the smaller <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> are needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} eight vehicles retained {{their old}} <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> and traffic numbers, but their power output {{was able to}} be increased by better ventilation to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traction for the {{locomotives}} is {{from six}} DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> Each motor is axle mounted. Power for the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> {{comes from the}} 25 kV overhead line via the roof mounted pantograph through a step down transformer and through the power control equipment to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> After the stepping down of the voltage the AC power is converted to DC by a bridge rectifier {{for use by the}} <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The power for each motor is rated at 500 kW whereas those of QR's most powerful diesel-electric locomotives were only rated at 275 kW.|$|R
25|$|The Prius Prime {{is powered}} by Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) powertrain, {{combining}} a 1.8L gasoline 4-cylinder port-injected inline-4 Atkinson cycle engine coupled with a dual motor generator drive system powered by an 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery. The second generator motor is allowed {{to play the role}} of a supplemental <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> while in all-electric mode.|$|E
25|$|The main {{alternator}} is a Brush BA1006A type, providing {{power for}} the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing {{power for the}} radiator fans, lubrication and fuel oil pumps, <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> cooling fans and air compressors amongst others. The main and auxiliary alternators are both driven by the main engine.|$|E
25|$|Trains draw current {{from two}} sets of 750-volt direct current guide bar/third rails {{on either side of}} each motor car. Nine-car trains draw large {{currents}} of up to 6,000 amperes, requiring that all models of rolling stock have calibrated <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> control systems to prevent power surges, arcing and breaker tripping. Both models have electrical braking (using motors) to assist primary friction braking, reducing the need to replace the brake pads.|$|E

50|$|The coupled wheels, {{rather than}} {{individual}} <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> encouraged resistance to wheelslip. This advantage was recognised and influenced future French designs, {{such as the}} typically French monomotor bogie rather than the axle-hung <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> used elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|A slug or drone {{locomotive}} is a non-powered unit {{attached to}} a diesel-electric locomotive to provide additional traction and braking capability. The slug has <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> but no engine. Power is supplied by the attached locomotive (known as a 'mother'). At slow speeds, a diesel-electric prime mover can produce more power than its own <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> can use; an installed slug increases the number of <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> available, thereby using the created power more effectively.|$|R
25|$|The Central {{line was}} shut between January and March 2003, after 32 {{passengers}} were injured when a train derailed at Chancery Lane {{due to a}} <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> falling on to the track. The line was not fully reopened until June. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Central line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007, and Transport for London took over its responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of interurbans {{in the late}} nineteenth century resulted from the convergence of two trends: improvements in electric traction, and an untapped demand for transportation in rural areas, particularly in the Midwestern United States. The 1880s saw the first successful deployments of electric traction in streetcar systems. Most of these built on the pioneering work of Frank J. Sprague, who developed an improved method for mounting an electric <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and using a trolley pole for pickup. Sprague's work led to widespread acceptance of electric traction for streetcar operations and end of horse-drawn trams.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} {{frame and body}} locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division technology in the prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall. The class {{was the first in}} the world to use the EMD D43 <b>traction</b> <b>motor,</b> similar to but smaller than that used in the C and G classes. Head end power is provided by a separate engine unit in a special compartment located at the number 1 end of the locomotive behind the electrical cabinet. The 240kW generator provides 415V 3-phase AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{three-phase}} {{electrical supply}} is rectified to DC to supply a pulse width modulator, {{which in turn}} generates a three-phase electrical supply to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> (which are of the induction type) - the four <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> are connected in parallel.|$|R
50|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an English Electric 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 6KT and the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> are two EE506 axle-hung, nose-suspended, force-ventilated <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> with 17.5:1 double {{reduction}} gear drive. The main generator is an EE type EE801/7D, flange-mounted single bearing rated at 490 kW.|$|R
50|$|At {{each end}} of the five-car set, there is a full-width cab. The cab cars are powered by four <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> each. The center car of each five-car set is an {{unpowered}} trailer, and the other two cars are powered by two <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> each.|$|R
25|$|In August 2014, MPI {{discovered}} that some <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> bearings had been shipped improperly to their factory, causing early failures. Locomotives already {{delivered to the}} MBTA were repaired on site, while half of the locomotives were redirected to Altoona Works during delivery for replacement bearings to be installed. The issues were not disclosed to the press until January 2015. While the repairs were performed under warranty {{at no cost to}} the MBTA, they constituted an additional delay that prevented some of the units from entering service prior to the end of 2015. The multiple delays and early mechanical issues have raised concern from industry commentators about the MBTA's procurement process and the overall quality of the locomotives.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency single-phase AC {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The number of poles on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E
500|$|The heating of the {{passenger}} cab is by a conventional [...] "wet" [...] automotive system. Heat {{is derived from the}} traction battery via a resistance element. Use of the heater significantly reduces range. The <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> cooling system runs at much lower temperatures than in a conventional car and is therefore separate from the cab heating system. While the car is charging, the interior can be preheated to alleviate the range reduction problem.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{of the two}} outer {{sections}} of each unit was fitted with a pantograph current collector. A total of eight <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> two {{for each of the}} four bogies, were installed in the chassis. The total continuous power rating of the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> was [...]|$|R
50|$|Upon {{starting}} {{and in the}} low notches, the {{major part of the}} voltage is dropped over the banks of resistors and all four <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> are in series. As the driver notches up, some of the resistor banks are cut out via the pneumatically operated switches and the voltage increases across the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The more resistors which are cut out as the driver notches higher, the more power is developed by the <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> At around 22 to 28 km/h the locomotive switches to a parallel combination, where the two <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> per bogie are in a series electrical circuit, while the two bogies are in parallel electrical circuit. Eventually, when all resistors are cut out, the locomotive is operating in full-field.|$|R
25|$|The {{closely related}} Class 318 units which were {{built for the}} Ayrshire Coast {{electrification}} in Scotland, are effectively a 3-car {{version of the same}} design, but with a lower speed capability of 90mph and are fitted with Brush <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> in place of GEC <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
