However, in many cases, the tower overhead {{is not easily}} condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his #13.

500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} a choral movement, [...] "" [...] (God the Lord is sun and shield). The {{instrumental}} ritornello introduces two themes: [...] "a festive, march-like theme for the horns and timpani, and a more lively counter-theme that develops from a note that is heard seven times." [...] The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the ritornello, structured in three parts, is among the longest among Bach's opening choruses. The horns are silent in the middle section, but the voices enter [...] "an imitative discussion of a simplified version of the string theme from the ritornello. Complex contrapuntal texture is used as the vehicle to convey the important and ultimately optimistic message ... The driving rhythms infusing the intricate swirling counterpoint produce an effect <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> infectious", as Mincham writes. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted during his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 the cantatas for Reformation at the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg where the Reformation began, describes the opening chorus as a ceremonial procession, and hears the [...] "insistent drum beat" [...] going along with the [...] "fanfares of the high horns" [...] as [...] "the hammering of Luther’s theses to the oak door {{at the back of}} the church".|$|E
500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] {{were all about}} these weird visuals", as well as [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder".|$|E

This was a reflection of my engagement in Zen." [...] While Mr. Cage's famous silent piece , or his Landscapes for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music, they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artist's power.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notorious}} police {{shooting}} in Montreal {{during this period}} was the 1991 shooting death of Marcellus François, an unarmed black man. In 1992, coroner Harvey Yarosky issued a report into François's death that condemned [...] "the existence of a racist attitude <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> unacceptable" [...] within Montreal's police force. Yeomans responded by agreeing that racism should be eradicated within the force, {{but he also said}} that Yarosky had [...] "exaggerated" [...] the extent of the problem by presenting the image of a generally dysfunctional department. In 1994, retired judge Albert Malouf released a review of the François shooting that was also strongly critical of police conduct; Yeomans acknowledged that the report was basically fair, though he added that Malouf's criticisms should not be regarded as applicable to the force as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsi Ali, {{a former}} devout Muslim who {{abandoned}} her faith {{and became an}} atheist, has been a vocal critic of Islam. In 2004, she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh, entitled Submission, a film depicting oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, critical of the Islamic canon itself. The film sparked controversy and death threats. Van Gogh was murdered later that year by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist. Hirsi Ali maintains that [...] "Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a political doctrine contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life." [...] Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform, in her latest book Heretic (2015) she calls for a reformation of Islam by defeating the Islamists and supporting reformist Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Gromyko {{had never}} been abroad before and, {{to get to the}} United States, he had to travel via {{airplane}} through Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to Genoa, Italy, where they boarded a ship to the United States. Italy became the first capitalist country in which Gromyko set foot. He later wrote in his Memoirs that New York City was a good example on how humans, by the [...] "means of wealth and technology are able to create something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>totally</b> alien to our nature". He further noticed the New York working districts which, in his own opinion, were proof of the inhumanity of capitalism and of the system's greed. Gromyko met and consulted with most of the senior officers of the United States government during his first days and succeeded Maxim Litvinov as ambassador to the United States in 1943. In his Memoirs Gromyko wrote fondly of President Franklin D. Roosevelt even though he believed him to be a representative of the bourgeoisie class. During his time as ambassador, Gromyko met prominent personalities such as British actor Charlie Chaplin, American actress Marilyn Monroe and British economist John Maynard Keynes.|$|E
