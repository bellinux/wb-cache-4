5000|$|Historically in Europe, rebar is {{composed}} of mild steel material with a yield strength of approximately 250 MPa (36 ksi). Modern rebar {{is composed}} of high-yield steel, with a yield strength more typically 500 MPa (72.5 ksi). Rebar can be supplied with various grades of ductility. The more ductile steel is capable of absorbing considerably more energy when deformed - a behavior that resists earthquake forces and is used in design. These high yield strength ductile steels are usually produced using the <b>TEMPCORE</b> process, a method of thermomechanical processing. The manufacture of reinforcing steel by re-rolling finished products (e.g. sheets or rails) is not allowed. In contrast to structural steel, rebar steel grades are not harmonized yet across Europe, each country having their own national standards. However some standardization of specification and testing methods exist under EN 10080 and EN ISO 15630: ...|$|E

Therefore,their mechanical properties study is important for the understanding of the rebar overall behaviour. In this paper it is presentedand discussed the results of hardness, strength and ductility obtained in tensile and hardness tests of several samples from <b>Tempcore</b> rebars (with high ductility) with various damage levels.

40|$|A "direct measurement" of {{the impact}} {{toughness}} of both <b>Tempcore</b> and microalloyed with vanadium reinforcing steel bars, of the same strength class (50 OMPa nominal yield stress), is undertaken. The term "direct measurement" means that V-notched specimens with the original round section of the bars (and not with the standard rectangular one) are used, mentioned here as direct V-notched (DVN) specimens. The major complications encountered with them are the use of non-standard geometry (Charpy V-notched, CVN), the variable size of the bars and the composite microstructure of the <b>Tempcore</b> reinforcing steel. It {{has been shown that}} the toughness characteristics of reinforcing steels may be estimated by the CVN impact test using direct (DVN) specimens. It is found that if the notch exceeds a critical depth, meaningful measurements may be obtained, regardless of the diameter of the reinforcing steel bar and that the transition temperature may be estimated from the residual fracture angle of direct (DVN) specimens. The microalloyed with vanadium reinforcing steel has a lower temperature-transition range from ductile-to-brittle fracture (- 10 degrees C), compared to the AISI 1020 steel, attributed to the vanadium micro-additions, but it is higher compared to the <b>Tempcore</b> steel (- 30 degrees C).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to discuss {{the influence of the}} mechanical characteristics of a "new" type of reinforcing steel presently used in Europe - grade #BETA# 500 <b>Tempcore</b> steel - on the ductility characteristics of seismic resistant reinforced concrete linear elements. The behaviour of these elements up to failure is also discussed, aiming at the collection of data for the calibration of analytical models. The characterization of the mechanical properties of <b>Tempcore</b> steel bars is {{made on the basis of}} a large number of test results. The influence of such properties on the ductility of linear elements is analytically discussed and its compatibility is checked against the rules of eurocode 8. An experimental research, consisting of the quasi-static test of 12 beam models, designed according to eurocode 8 and reinforced with grade #BETA# 500 <b>Tempcore</b> steel is also presented. Its results are discussed both to access the adequacy of such steel to be used in seismic resistant structures and also to study behaviour of the beams up to failure in order to obtain data for the calibration of hysteretic models.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{performance}} of four different sets of reinforcing steel rebars, S 220, S 400, S 500 s <b>Tempcore</b> and S 500 s Vanadus, exposed to the Greek atmosphere, before their installation into the concrete. The performance against atmospheric corrosion of the aforementioned steel rebars was evaluated by means of microscopy techniques and corrosion rate measurements. In particular, we studied the influence of corrosion products of a set of reinforcement steels on the bond strength between concrete and steel bars, during the hydration process of cement. Furthermore, microscopy techniques. and visual observation were used to identify the rust strains and the corrosion product morphology of steel reinforcements before their installation into the concrete. The experimental results shown that the steel type, which exhibits the higher resistance. as far as atmospheric corrosion concerns, was S 220 reinforcing steel. In contrary, S 500 s <b>Tempcore</b> has the least corrosion resistance. The bond strength between concrete and the steel rebars was found to decrease with increasing weathering from 45 to 122 days. due to the morphology and to the thickness of the rust layers formed on steel surface, as observed by the ESEM.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structures in}} seismic areas are designed {{according to the}} capacity design approach, aiming to achieve ductile global collapse mechanisms dissipating the seismic energy through high deformations in correspondence of the ends of beams and columns. The global dissipative capacity of the building {{is related to the}} rotational capacity of sections and to the ductile properties of reinforcing bars. <b>TempCore</b> steel is used for RC constructions, due to its optimal strength and ductility properties and to the satisfaction of Eurocode 8 requirements concerning Agt and Rm/Re. Several studies in the current scientific literature anyway highlighted durability problems of <b>TempCore</b> bars exposed to corrosion conditions, with loss of ductility and strength even below the standards requirements. Dual-Phase (DP) steels, characterized by excellent mechanical and durability properties due to their Ferrite-Martensite microstructure and commonly adopted in the automotive sector, can be a possible solution to the problem. The possibility to produce DP rebars for RC structures is deeply analyzed in the European research project NEWREBAR “New Dual-Phase steel reinforcing bars for enhancing capacity and durability of anti-seismic moment resisting frames”, actually ongoing. The elaboration of new technical models for the design of RC elements, to be implemented in design guidelines and standards, is needed. In the present paper, preliminary results are presented concerning the selection of DP steel bars and the definition of technical models for RC elements with DP reinforcements...|$|E
40|$|The {{load bearing}} {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete structures after fire can be assessed if the modified mechanical properties of the building materials, designated here as 'residual', are known. In this respect, the residual properties of reinforcing steels produced (a) by the <b>Tempcore</b> process; (b) microalloying with vanadium; and (c) work-hardening, all falling into grade FeB 500 S, were selected for investigation, aiming to represent {{a wide range of}} steels currently available for the construction industry in Europe. For both the microalloyed with vanadium and for the work-hardened reinforcing steels typical diameters were investigated. For the Tempcore-type reinforcing steels, due to their heterogeneous structure, the effect of size and composition have been also examined. Specimens of the above types of steel were heated at temperatures ranging from 200 degreesC to 800 degreesC for 1 h and then cooled in air to room temperature. Thereafter, their residual properties were assessed by hardness measurements, tensile and Charpy-V impact tests. Metallographic analysis was used to correlate mechanical properties to microstructural characteristics. From the above investigation it was concluded that the <b>Tempcore</b> steels presented the more stable behavior up to temperatures of 500 degreesC, while the microalloyed steel, although it presented very satisfactory tensile properties, displayed low impact toughness due to coarsening of vanadium carbides. The work-hardened steel showed a continuous drop of its properties from approximately 250 degreesC and suffered from brittleness in the vicinity of 200 degreesC due to strain aging phenomena.

In particular a comparison of the capacity, in terms of ductility, of r. c. structural elements reinforced using dual-phase (DP) steel bars with that of identical structures reinforced with the traditional <b>Tempcore</b> steel bars, currently used in practice, has been carried out.

40|$|The {{residual}} {{mechanical properties}} of two families of special concretes (self-compacting limestone concrete -SCC and shotcrete) exposed to high temperature are investigated {{in the first}} part of this chapter, since the spe-cific properties of these concretes may in principle affect their mechanical behavior at high temperature, more than in ordinary vibrated concrete. The results show that this is not the case, but in shotcrete the type of the accelerating agent may severely affect concrete strength in virgin conditions, with major consequences on the strength at high temperature. In the second part of the chapter, new information is provided on the residual properties of the reinforcement (carbon-steel bars, <b>tempcore</b> bars and stainless-steel bars), as well as some results concerning the residual be-havior of steel and polymeric fibers, and bar-concrete bond.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of DSC analysis of steel B 500 SP produced in the process of continuous casting, which is intended for the production reinforcement rods with high ductility. Studies were carried out in the temperature range below 1000 °C in a protective atmosphere of helium during samples heating program. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the temperature range of austenite structure formation during heating. As a result of performed experiments: Ac 1 s, Ac 1 f – temperatures of the beginning and finish of the eutectoid transformation, Ac 2 – Curie temperature of the ferrite magnetic transformation and the temperature Ac 3 of transformation of proeutectoid ferrite into austenite were elaborated. Experimental determination of phase transformations temperatures of steel B 500 SP has great importance for production technology of reinforcement rods, because good mechanical properties of rods are formed by the special thermal treatment in <b>Tempcore</b> process...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to evaluate the effect of manufacturing process upon the performance of reinforcing steel bars against atmospheric corrosion. Reinforcing steel bars produced by different manufacturing methods {{were exposed to the}} atmosphere in Athens for different periods of time. The progress of corrosion was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion layer formed {{on the surface of the}} bars. The morphology of the corroded layer was studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while X-ray diffraction analysis was used to identify the mineralogical composition of the corrosion products. Independently of the manufacturing process used, the main corrosion product formed was lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), followed closely by akaganeite (beta-FeOOH) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). Furthermore, it was found that the surface condition and the initial oxide layer on the steel bars, which is closely related to the manufacturing process, played a major role in the development of corrosion in atmosphere. Work-hardened reinforcing steel bars were found very sensitive to exhibition in the usual atmospheric conditions, followed by the <b>Tempcore</b> steel bars. The hot-rolled bars, either unalloyed or microalloyed with vanadium, presented the best corrosion behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{combined}} effects of Low-Cycle Fatigue (LCF) action and corrosion phenomena on steel reinforcing bars were accurately investigated, aiming at {{the definition of}} the effective seismic mechanical capacity of steel bars in comparison to what required by real earthquake events. The ability of corroded specimens to still sustain the ductile demand (in terms of strain and dissipated energy) of seismic events was accurately investigated. The thesis was developed inside the widest framework of an European Research project, (Effects of Corrosion on Low-Cycle Fatigue (Seismic) Behaviour of High Strength Steel Reinforcing Bars, 2009), funded by the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. The necessity to investigate the ductile behaviour of steel reinforcing bars lies in the absence of detailed studies about the effective behaviour of rebars under seismic action, that is reflected in the lack of codified standards and procedures for the production control of the seismic behaviour of steel bars. In this context in fact, the revision of European standard EN 10080 and in particular, Mandate M 115 aims at the individuation of common procedures for the harmonization of the standards about reinforcing and pre-stressed steels for concrete. A detailed investigation of the effective mechanical capacity under cyclic-seismic action was carried out on a set of steel reinforcing bars representative of the actual European production: in particular, a preliminary protocol for the execution of LCF tests was elaborated taking into account the information actually provided by scientific literature and standards. The ductile capacity of steel reinforcements so evaluated was then compared to the effective ductility demand required by real earthquake, leading finally to the elaboration of a proposal for the assessment of the LCF behaviour of steel bars during the production process. More in details, the demand in terms of strain and dissipated energy density on steel reinforcing bars was evaluated through an accurate numerical analysis of the structural behaviour of r. c. case studies designed according to actual standards for constructions (Eurocode 8, Italian Standard D. M. 14 / 01 / 2008). Moreover, since the current scientific literature (Apostolopoulos 2006, Apostolopoulos and Papadakis 2008) evidenced that, in presence of aggressive environmental conditions, <b>TempCore</b> steel reinforcing bars generally exhibit a progressive damaging and a rapid decrease of the mechanical properties (i. e. strain, strenght and dissipative capacity), the experimental test campaign on rebars was consequently repeated on corroded steel reinforcements. The effects of corrosion on rebars were opportunely reproduced through the execution of accelerated corrosion tests in salt spray chamber following a suitably defined protocol. The analysis of the ductile capacity of corroded steel reinforcing bars allowed the assessment of the ability of corroded bars to still sustain the ductile requirements due to real seismic events...|$|E
