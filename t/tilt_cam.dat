The present study was conducted to examine the association of knee joint anatomic parameters with osteoarthritis occurrence. Methods: In the present observational-comparative study, ninety-four patients with joint osteoarthritis as case group and 106 healthy individuals as control group were enrolled from Orthopedic Clinic of Shahrekord Hospital into the study for comparison. Anatomical parameters such as tibial plateau <b>tilt,</b> <b>Cam</b> effect, and tibial plateau coverage by femoral condyles were calculated by using radiographic findings and compared between two groups. The data were analyzed by SPSS software 16 using chi-square and Pearson correlation Results: Tibial plateau tilt values in patients with osteoarthritis of knee (11. 9 ± 3. 4 °) was significantly higher than the control group (10. 2 ± 1. 9 °) (p< 0. 001). Cam effect in patients with osteoarthritis (1. 8 ± 0. 1) was higher than control group (1. 7 ± 0. 1) (p< 0. 001). Index of tibial plateau articular surface occupied by condyles of femur in patients with osteoarthritis were 2 / 3 ± 9 / 51 % and 1 / 2 ± 1 / 50 % in the control group respectively (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Anatomic parameters under study could be used to predict osteoarthritis occurrence in healthy individuals...|$|E
50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically <b>tilting</b> delayed <b>camming</b> action. This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the slide recocks the hammer, and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the pistol’s frame. The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a safety notch. A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the pistol’s frame.|$|R
