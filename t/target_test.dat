40|$|Routine HIV {{testing is}} an {{essential}} approach to identifying undiagnosed infections, linking people to care and treatment, and preventing new infections. In Washington, DC, where HIV prevalence is 2. 4 %, a combination of routine and <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> approaches has been implemented since 2006. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health's routine and <b>targeted</b> HIV <b>testing</b> implementation strategies. We collected HIV testing data from 3 types of DC Department of Health-funded testing sites (clinics, hospitals, and community-based organizations); collected testing and labor costs; and calculated effectiveness measures including cost per new diagnosis and cost per averted transmission. Compared to routine <b>testing,</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> resulted in higher positivity rates (1. 33 % vs. 0. 44 %). Routine testing averted 34. 30 transmissions per year compared to <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> at 17. 78. The cost per new diagnosis was lower for <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> ($ 2, 467 vs. $ 7, 753 per new diagnosis) as was the cost per transmission averted ($ 33, 160 vs. $ 104, 205). When stratified by testing site, both testing approaches were most cost effective in averting new transmissions when conducted by community based organizations ($ 25, 037 routine; $ 33, 123 targeted) compared to hospitals or clinics. While routine testing identified more newly diagnosed infections and averted more infections than <b>targeted</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> is more cost effective per diagnosis and per transmission averted overall.

50|$|The Aries {{series is}} a type of American target missile. The Naval Research Laboratory {{contracted}} with Space Vector Corporation to develop a single-stage sounding rocket using surplus Minuteman I second stages. Informally called 'Fat Albert', the first was launched with a dummy payload on 17 October 1973.The Aries mated the Aerojet M56 solid-propellant rocket stage to four fixed tail fins and a nose cone. Four gimbaled nozzles provided steering, keyed by a new guidance and control system. Until the end of 2004, a total of more than 50 Aries rockets had been launched, and use as a ballistic missile target vehicle is continuing. Prime contractor for Aries-type target boosters was later Orbital Sciences Corporation, which renamed the rocket the TTV (<b>Target</b> <b>Test</b> Vehicle). The Aries was later used by NASA to launch X-ray and UV telescopes into space. Maximum payload capacity was 1590 kg / 3500 lb. USAF and NASA launched more than 20 Aries rockets on scientific missions until the early 1990s. The majority of tests were launched by the US military at targets for the U.S. Navy's RIM-156B SM-2 Block IV A and RIM-161 SM-3 interceptor missiles.|$|E

40|$|Background The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip is an array-based {{technology}} for analysing DNA methylation at approximately 475, 000 differentially methylated cytosines across the human genome. Hitherto, the array {{has been used}} for case-control studies, where sample numbers can be sufficient to yield statistically robust data on a genome-wide basis. We recently reported an informatic pipeline capable of yielding statistically and biologically significant results using only five cases, which expanded the use of this technology to rare disease studies. However, the clinical application of these technologies requires the ability to perform robust analysis of individual patients. Results Here we report a novel informatic approach for methylation array analysis of single samples, using the Crawford-Howell t-test. We tested our approach on patients with ultra-rare imprinting disorders with aberrant DNA methylation at multiple locations across the genome, which was previously detected by <b>targeted</b> <b>testing.</b> However, array analysis outperformed targeted assays in three ways: it detected loci not normally analysed by <b>targeted</b> <b>testing,</b> detected methylation changes too subtle to detect by the <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> and reported broad and consistent methylation changes across genetic loci not captured by point testing. Conclusions This method has potential clinical utility for human disorders where DNA methylation change may be a biomarker of disease. <br/...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} designing the sequences of multiple nucleic acid strands intended to hybridize in solution via a prescribed reaction pathway. Sequence design is formulated as a multistate optimization problem using a set of <b>target</b> <b>test</b> tubes to represent reactant, intermediate, and product states of the system, {{as well as to}} model crosstalk between components. Each <b>target</b> <b>test</b> tube contains a set of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Optimization of the equilibrium ensemble properties of the <b>target</b> <b>test</b> tubes implements both a positive design paradigm, explicitly designing for on-pathway elementary steps, and a negative design paradigm, explicitly designing against off-pathway crosstalk. Sequence design is performed subject to diverse user-specified sequence constraints including composition constraints, complementarity constraints, pattern prevention constraints, and biological constraints. Constrained multistate sequence design facilitates nucleic acid reaction pathway engineering for diverse applications in molecular programming and synthetic biology.

40|$|Testing of on-chip RF and {{microwave}} circuits {{has always been}} a challenge to test engineers and has been more so in the recent past due to the high signal frequencies involved and the dense levels of circuit integration.

Hence, instead of testing the devices specifically for complex performance metrics (this is difficult for embedded circuits), the outputs of the sensors are used to accurately estimate the <b>target</b> <b>test</b> specification values when the device-under-test is stimulated with sinusoidal stimulus. This significantly impacts the cost of manufacturing test and allows testing to be performed using low-cost external testers.

30|$|Given that a nonequivalent {{groups with}} anchor test design was used, the item {{selection}} was {{performed at the}} same time that test forms were linked. The fixed item parameter method was used to link the test forms. This procedure calibrates each test form separately and sequentially. A test form is selected as the reference test and the measure values of the anchor items obtained by its calibration are used to perform the calibration of a <b>target</b> <b>test</b> form (de Ayala, 2009). According to this procedure, the values of the common items are fixed to the values obtained by the calibration of the reference test and are not re-estimated in the <b>target</b> <b>test</b> calibration, thus placing the <b>target</b> <b>test</b> form on the measurement scale of the reference test form (Kolen & Brennan, 2010). Anchor items that are used in test scaling or linking should ideally be distributed along the difficulty range of the test, be representative of the test content and of reasonably stable difficulty across test forms (Dorans et al. 2011; Huynh & Meyer, 2010). To evaluate the stability of the common items’ difficulty between adjacent grades, displacement measures should be estimated for each anchor item to check discrepancies between the anchor value and the parameter that would have been estimated for the <b>target</b> <b>test</b> form if this parameter was unanchored (Linacre, 2011). The values of the anchor items’ displacement should be less than 0.50 logits, but they can assume values as large as 1.0 logits without causing much impact on measurement, as mentioned by Linacre (2011).|$|E

Other forms of hereditary neuropathy, including sensory predominant or motor predominant forms, are sometimes included in the general classification of CMT, but {{for the purpose of this}} review, we will focus primarily on the forms associated with both sensory and motor deficits. CMT has a great deal of genetic heterogeneity, leading to diagnostic considerations that are still rapidly evolving for this disorder. Clinical features, inheritance pattern, gene mutation frequencies, and electrodiagnostic features all are helpful in formulating <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> algorithms in practical clinical settings, but these still have shortcomings. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with multigene testing panels, is increasing the sensitivity and efficiency of genetic testing and is quickly overtaking <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> strategies. Currently, multigene panel testing and NGS can be considered first-line in many circumstances, although obtaining initial <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> for the PMP 22 duplication in CMT patients with demyelinating conduction velocities is still a reasonable strategy. As technology improves and cost continues to fall, <b>targeted</b> <b>testing</b> will be completely replaced by multigene NGS panels that can detect the full spectrum of CMT mutations. Nevertheless, clinical acumen is still necessary given the variants of uncertain significance encountered with NGS. Despite the current limitations, the genetic diagnosis of CMT is critical for accurate prognostication, genetic counseling, and in the future, specific targeted therapies. Although whole exome and whole genome sequencing strategies have the power to further elucidate the genetics of CMT, continued technological advances are needed.
