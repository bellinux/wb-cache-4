5|$|An early {{goal of the}} Dota 2 {{team was}} the {{adaptation}} of Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> aesthetic style for the Source engine. The Radiant and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod, respectively. Character names, abilities, items and map design from the mod were largely retained, with some changes due to trademarks owned by Blizzard. In the first Q session regarding Dota 2, IceFrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core. Valve contracted major contributors from the Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> community, including Eul and artist Kendrick Lim, {{to assist with the}} sequel. Additional contributions from sources outside of Valve were also sought regularly for Dota 2, as to continue Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> tradition of community-sourced development. One of the composers of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Jason Hayes, was hired to collaborate with Tim Larkin to write the original score for the game, which was conducted by Timothy Williams and performed and recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Bastyr University. Valve had Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw, science fiction author Ted Kosmatka, and Steam support employee Kris Katz write new dialog and background lore for the heroes. Notable voice actors for the English version include Nolan North, Dave Fennoy, Jon St. John, Ellen McLain, Fred Tatasciore, Merle Dandridge, Jen Taylor, and John Patrick Lowrie.|$|E
50|$|Mordo {{leaves the}} palace shortly {{afterwards}} and Stephen becomes <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's successor {{under the name}} Doctor Strange. <b>The</b> <b>Ancient</b> One often assists Strange. But when the extra-dimensional monster Shuma-Gorath tries to invade Earth through <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's mind while the latter is in the Crypts of Kaa-U, <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One prompts Strange to destroy the portion of <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's mind in which the ego, or sense of self, exists. While such action blocks the way for Shuma-Gorath, trapping him within <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's mind, <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's physical body is also destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's corporeal existence is over, but his soul subsequently achieves transcendence, becoming one with the universe and Eternity. Strange then inherits <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's title as Sorcerer Supreme.|$|R

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, {{and still not}} fully resolved. Known to <b>the</b> <b>ancients,</b> the genus name appears in Graeco-Roman literature, although their interest was as much medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species <b>the</b> <b>ancients</b> were familiar with. Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a family (Narcissi) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern placement within Amaryllidaceae, although {{for a while it}} was considered part of Liliaceae.|$|E

5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to <b>the</b> <b>ancients</b> and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> increased over time. The scenario was featured by Computer Gaming World {{in a review}} of new maps and mods in Warcraft III. DotA Allstars became an important tournament scenario, starting with its prominence at the debut of Blizzard's BlizzCon convention in 2005. DotA Allstars was also featured in the Malaysia and Singapore World Cyber Games starting in 2005, and the World Cyber Games Asian Championships beginning with the 2006 season. Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> was included in the game lineup for the internationally recognized Cyberathlete Amateur League and CyberEvolution leagues. Additionally, the scenario appeared in Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) 2008; Oliver Paradis, ESWC's competition manager, noted that the high level of community support behind the scenario, as well as its worldwide appeal, were among the reasons it was chosen.|$|E

Mordo began to plot against Strange, though <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One kept protecting him. Mordo soon left the palace and Stephen became <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's successor. <b>The</b> <b>Ancient</b> One would often assist Stephen, until Shuma-Gorath killed <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's physical body.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because <b>the</b> <b>ancients</b> noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and <b>the</b> <b>ancients)</b> to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of <b>the</b> <b>ancients.</b> The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ancient</b> Scythians were a {{semi-nomadic}} Iranian {{people that}} lived around the northern {{area of the}} Black Sea with territory that stretched up into the Ural and Altai Mountain region.

5|$|In Greece, copper {{was known}} by the name chalkos (χαλκός). It was an {{important}} resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to <b>the</b> <b>ancients</b> {{were associated with the}} seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. It has {{its place in}} mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. <b>The</b> <b>Ancients</b> personified it, believing it {{to be under the}} control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.|$|E
5|$|Valve's {{interest}} in the Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and producer Erik Johnson, became fans of the mod and {{wanted to build a}} modern sequel. The company corresponded with IceFrog by email about his long-term plans for the project, and he was subsequently hired to direct a sequel. IceFrog first announced his new position through his blog in October 2009, and Dota 2 was publicly announced by Game Informer in October 2010.|$|E

5|$|Defense of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> is {{maintained}} via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, {{some of which}} are added to the map. Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while the map loads, and suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version of the map was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for League of Legends as the reason for its end.|$|E
