5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, was never able <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game too short and felt it failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to its promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards.

Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E

5|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link {{and her father}} the king who have not returned from their quest. As with Faces of Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil, modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E
5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E

5|$|Itachi is {{a member}} of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, {{establishing}} milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to. His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{had been}} granted {{first-class}} status {{in advance of the}} 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883. The county failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club {{at the end of the}} 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to 20years.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of 30 Rock premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the {{previous}} season, it also consisted of 22 episodes. A recurring story arc {{early in the}} season revolved around Jack's request that Liz cast a new actor for TGS, and Liz's subsequent search for the perfect comedian, much to the dismay of Jenna and Tracy, who fear losing their spotlight. The latter half of the season focused on complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between his two girlfriends, Liz's inability to find a boyfriend <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to her expectations, and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as Julianne Moore, Jon Bon Jovi, Cheyenne Jackson, Sherri Shepherd, Will Forte, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Sheen, Matt Damon, and James Franco.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about {{the same amount of money}} as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E

5|$|The team's biggest {{success in}} 2009 was Contador's overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France. Elsewhere, their main successes in 2009 were in small stage races, with Contador winning the Volta ao Algarve and the Vuelta al País Vasco {{as well as two}} stages in Paris–Nice, and Leipheimer winning the Tour of California and the Vuelta a Castilla y León. The team also won the team {{classification}} at numerous events. The team failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to lofty expectations in the Giro d'Italia; Leipheimer was widely considered a favorite for victory, as was Armstrong before a collarbone injury sustained weeks before, but Leipheimer finished sixth overall and the team did not win any stage.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he was the}} team's second leading scorer, Tanguay {{continued}} {{to be the subject}} of trade talks throughout the season. Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to the team's expectations in the playoffs even though he {{continued to}} struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City {{were founded}} as Small Heath Alliance in 1875, and from 1877 played their home games at Muntz Street. The club turned {{professional}} in 1885, {{and three years}} later became the first football club to become a limited company with a board of directors, {{under the name of}} Small Heath F.C. Ltd. From the 1889–90 season they played in the Football Alliance, which ran alongside the Football League. In 1892, Small Heath, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed Football League Second Division. They finished as champions, but failed to win promotion via the test match system; the following season promotion to the First Division was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over Darwen. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and moved into their new home, St Andrew's Ground, the following year. Matters on the field failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> to their surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for re-election two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War.|$|E
