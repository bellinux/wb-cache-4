5000|$|Darryl F. Zanuck showed Fuller, who {{was then}} under {{contract}} to 20th Century Fox, a script by Dwight Taylor called Blaze of Glory about a woman lawyer {{falling in love with}} a criminal she was defending in a murder trial.

Fuller asked Zanuck if he could write a story of a lower criminal and his girlfriend that he originally titled Pickpocket but Zanuck thought the title too [...] "European". Fuller had memories of South Street from his days as a crime reporter and came up with his new title. Fuller met Detective Dan Campion of the New York Police Department to research the background material of his story to add realism, with Fuller basing the role of Tiger the police detective on Campion who had been suspended without salary for six months for manhandling a suspect.|$|E
50|$|Peck {{was hired}} as a deck boy in 1935, and he joined in a work strike on a boat for better food during his first voyage. In September 1935, Peck was on a boat that {{anchored}} in Pensacola, Florida, where Peck joined the longshoremen who were on strike. Peck claimed the union hall was fully integrated at the time by the striking longshoremen. Peck remained there for two weeks before police arrested him for distributing rank-and-file literature on a boat, marking his first arrest. In the labor movement in the 1930s he helped found what later became the National Maritime Union. Joseph Curran led a strike aboard a ship in March 1936, anchored in NYC. Peck picketed with the longshoremen {{for the first time on}} March 22, 1936. He then picketed again from November 1936 to January 1937. Curran led the fight against Joe Ryan. This led to the formation of the NMU, the strongest east coast longshoremen union. Peck would later criticize Joseph Curran's transformation once in power of the NMU. On May 11, 1936, Peck was arrested for the second time in his life. Police clashed with striking seamen that day, with Peck being beaten and arrested. This marked Peck's first mass arrest, as one of 221 strikers arrested that day. That night they were arraigned, making it the largest group every arraigned at the same time in <b>that</b> <b>courtroom.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Coherence, the {{relationships}} which link {{the meanings of}} utterances in a discourse or of the sentences in a text, is realized on two levels: linear or sequential coherence and global semantic structure. Taking the audio recording transcripts of two trials (one criminal and one civil) as data, this paper analyzes coherence of Chinese courtroom discourse. The findings indicate <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> discourse is coherent semantically (there are meaning relations between {{different parts of the}} discourse), topically (different parts of the discourse accord with its general topic), contextually (different parts of the discourse mix with the context and accomplish the communication together), and historically (the discourse refers back to its history, i. e. preceding trials, etc) ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{studies of}} {{courtroom}} decisionmaking emphasize contextual variation {{and the interaction}} {{of large numbers of}} variables In explaining decision outcomes. However, theory suggests <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> decisions may be dominated by simple "rules of thumb" that allow decisionmakers to cope with scarcity of time and resources. Following this approach, a parslmonious model of plea bargaining as a two-person game is developed and hypotheses are derived. Data on negotiated sentences for burglary and robbery in three California counties serve to test the hypotheses. The findings confirm that prior criminal history is the dominant factor in determining the severity of negotiated sentences and that defendents with more extensive prior records have less incentive to plea bargalh. Identlfication of this decision rule for negotiated sentences contradlcts arguments for limiting plea bargaining that assume negotiations result in sentencing leniency across the board.

40|$|In {{the case}} of many {{institutional}} buildings, such as courthouses, program and functional requirements present fixed precepts and unwritten demands that greatly affect the spatial layout {{of the building and}} ultimately its form. These requirements specify underlying functional structures in courtroom floors, which affect the form and layout of the courthouse building. It is the purpose of this research to identify these functional structures in order to discover commonalities between them and establish them as functional genotype. The research proceeded by selecting twenty-five courtroom floors in different courthouses, and through archival and architectural analysis, the research identified underlying functional structures. The research found that within the analyzed sample 16 courtroom floors adhered to a typical genotype while others followed slightly varied genotypes. It was concluded <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> floors adhere to a generic genotype with regard to accessibility and pattern of circulation. Future investigation can investigate how these genotypes can be realized in different geometrical arrangements and accordingly can be used in the design of future courthouses...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares some {{features}} of the interactional details of a Tenejapan (Mexico) court case with the {{features of}} social interaction characteristic of ordinary, casual encounters in this society. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> behaviour in Tenejapa {{is a very special}} form of interaction, in a context that uniquely allows for direct face-to-face confrontation in a society where a premium is placed on interactional restraint. Courtroom speech in Tenejapa directly contraverts norms and conventions that operate in other contexts, and women’s conventionalized polite ‘ways of putting things’ are here used sarcastically to be impolite. Thus, in this society, gender operates across contexts as a ‘master status’, but with gender meanings transformed in the different contexts: forms associated with superficial cooperation and agreement being used to emphasize lack of cooperation, disagreement, and hostility. The implications of this Tenejapan phenomenon for our {{understanding of the nature of}} relations between language and gender are explored...|$|E
40|$|Departing {{from the}} well-trodden path of {{traditional}} phraseology, this study adopts the distributional perspective {{to account for}} patterns with the progressive form of four common verbs of speaking (i. e. say, talk, tell and speak) in courtroom interaction. Drawing on data from a libel trial, it demonstrates that speakers rely on the progressive construction to convey evaluative meanings and to position themselves vis-à-vis other speakers and their utterances. More precisely, the analysis demonstrates that patterns with the progressive saying, which are most frequent in the data, tend to appear in negative contexts and display a negative discourse prosody resulting from the interplay of the collocational co-occurrences and the wider interactional context. At the same time, it is revealed that the evaluative leanings of patterns with the progressives talking, telling and speaking are not so manifest. Overall, the study indicates that verba dicendi perform pragmatic functions other than the transmission of information or the signalling of the speaking activity itself. It also shows <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> interactants use the “interpretive” or “explanatory” progressive which betrays the speaker’s attitude and perspective of the situation as well as conveys his or her evaluation at a particular moment of interaction...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental to all {{evidence}} rules is {{the division of}} responsibility between the judge, who determines the admissibility of evidence, and the jury, which gauges its weight. In most evidentiary contexts, such as those involving hearsay and character, threshold admissibility obligations are clear and relatively uncontroversial. The same is not true for scientific evidence. The complex nature of scientific inference, {{and in particular the}} challenges of reasoning from group data to individual cases, has bedeviled courts. As a result, courts vary considerably on how they define the judge’s gatekeeping task under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and its state equivalents. This Article seeks to reconceptualize gatekeeping analysis in scientific evidence cases based on the nature of science itself, specifically, the division between general and case-specific scientific findings. Because expert testimony describing basic science, “framework” science, and the scientific methods an expert uses to reach conclusions transcend the case at hand, the validity of these facts ought to be determined by the judge. In contrast, when an expert claims to have used a methodology approved by the judge, but a dispute arises as to whether the expert in fact did so, the question becomes one of credibility specific to the case, and is for the jury. This division between general and case-specific preliminary facts is simpler to administer than other admissibility–weight frameworks, which have relied primarily on problematic attempts to distinguish scientific methods from scientific conclusions. It is also fully consistent with, and helps implement, basic principles of both constitutional and evidentiary jurisprudence by ensuring that the trial judge—presumptively better attuned to matters of general import—decides reliability issues, while the jury—historically viewed as trier of the facts—is the ultimate arbiter of those case-specific matters requiring a credibility assessment. Because the general–specific divide likewise argues for a stiff standard of appellate review on scientific reliability issues, our alignment of evidence law with the nature of scientific research also provides the best court-monitored mechanism for ensuring <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> use of science is both sophisticated and consistent across cases...|$|E
