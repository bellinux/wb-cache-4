5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, but now found themselves in decline, mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; they decimated populations before battles were even fought. It is estimated that 90% of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b> The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. <b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> had been significantly reduced.|$|E

Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government.

Just 9% of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%.

5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|López de Salcedo {{was under}} orders to {{investigate}} the state of affairs in the troubled province, and take whatever actions were necessary to impose order. He and his immediate successors promoted their own personal ambitions over the good government of Honduras, sowing division amongst the colonists, and instituting harsh policies against <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b> In 1527 the natives rebelled against their brutal treatment. The punishment meted out to the rebellious Indians only served to incite further revolts. López de Salcedo arrested Saavedra and his supporters and shipped them to Santo Domingo to be tried by the Audiencia. The prisoners seized control {{of the ship and}} sailed for Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Spanish {{invasion}} in 1524, {{the population of}} Guatemala was almost exclusively Maya. The Spanish conquest created a system of wealthy European landowners overseeing a labor force composed of slaves and bonded laborers. However, the community lands of <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> remained in their control until the late 19th century. At this point, rising global demand for coffee made its export {{a significant source of}} income for the government. As a result, the state supported the coffee growers by passing legislation that took land away from the Indian population, as well as relaxing labor laws so that bonded labor could be used on the plantations.|$|E
5|$|The Chilembwe {{uprising}} was {{a rebellion}} against British colonial rule in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) in January 1915, led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister, whose radical evangelical views of racial injustice {{may also have}} been influenced by millenarian Christian. Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the black middle class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the new demands on <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> at {{the time}} of the first European {{settlements}} is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of European colonization, the population of Canada's indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> was {{originally}} animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E
