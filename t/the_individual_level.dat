Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism).

30|$|As {{regards the}} {{relation}} between personal (demographic and job-related) characteristics and overeducation, our dataset confirms the results most frequently highlighted by the literature. Our analysis shows, not surprisingly, that female workers {{are more likely to}} be overeducated. <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>individual’s</b> <b>level</b> of education, <b>the</b> more overeducation can be expected; and <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>individual’s</b> job <b>level,</b> <b>the</b> less overeducation can be expected. Controls for firm size and industry reveal that overeducation occurs more often in small firms compared to large firms and more often in trade, transport, and hospitality compared to the other commercial services or to primary and secondary economic activities. Thus, the characteristics of both workers and national labour markets influence the incidence of overeducation.|$|R
25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>level.</b> As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease. This resulted in the American government recommending that people adopt a low-fat diet in order to prevent heart disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} {{assessment of}} patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This {{means that the}} patients are asked to define their goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Functional deﬁcits can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>level</b> rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as dressing, grooming). It is useful to make a distinction between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E
25|$|Although {{statistically}} {{not significant}} enough sample size to be a nationwide projection, {{a study on}} 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA showed a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Another clustering analyses performed on data from autosomal ancestry-sensitive SNPs – providing somewhat approximate representation of the bi-parentally inherited part of the genome – demonstrated a major European component (overall 78.5%) in the pooled Argentinean sample, whereas the Native American component (overall 17.3%) was lower but considerable, and the African component was very small (overall 4.1%). Despite this general trend in the genetic variation, {{it should be noted}} that analyses revealed a considerable genetic heterogeneity at <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>level,</b> also noticed before in a smaller number of Argentinean samples. About 40% of the sampled individuals attained more than 90% of European ancestry, but the Native American proportion was as high as 80% (although this was observed only in a single individual). Such findings reflect the dynamics of the recent demographic history of the extant Argentinean population, indicating that individuals retaining a higher proportion of European ancestry could be descendants from the recent newcomers to the Argentinean population, whereas those with a higher amount of Native American admixture could be descendants from the first contact between the European and Amerindian populations, starting approximately 500 years ago.|$|E

500|$|These {{physical}} variations {{create a}} distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire {{a reputation as}} a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude— above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball [...] into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>level,</b> a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.|$|E
