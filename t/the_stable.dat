5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into <b>the</b> <b>stable,</b> tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>stables</b> are {{connected}} to an adjoining two-storey house. They provided accommodation for ten horses and included four loose boxes, a harness room and a coachman's house; six bedrooms above were for servants. Two coach houses were later used as garages. <b>The</b> <b>stables</b> building was marketed in 1997 for approximately £70,000. Charles McKean describes <b>the</b> <b>stables</b> as [...] "straddling the skyline like a palace". <b>The</b> <b>stables</b> are listed by Historic Scotland as being at very high risk, and were described in 1997 sale literature as unused and dilapidated.|$|R

5|$|The New Breed {{instantly}} began feuding {{with the}} ECW Originals. They faced off in several matches throughout the year, including at WrestleMania 23. After this, both groups began recruiting CM Punk, who elected {{to join the}} New Breed. Two weeks later however, he turned on Burke during a match. Thorn and Ariel left <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> shortly afterward as well. The New Breed continued to feud with the Originals and Punk, and also with The Major Brothers, a new tag team who had defeated Striker and Cor Von in their debut match. By June 2007, <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> had dissolved, with the three remaining members quietly separating.|$|E
5|$|The {{only member}} of <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> who is still {{currently}} employed by the WWE is Randy Orton.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, when he {{returned}} to Japan from Germany, he had to work in <b>the</b> <b>stables</b> to make a living. He had to wake up at 5am every morning to clean up <b>the</b> <b>stables.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stables</b> have slab {{walls to}} plate height and {{comprise}} a rectangular core with a gabled roof and a verandah roof to the west, north and east. There {{is also a}} lean to extension to <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> <b>stables</b> have a weatherboard hayloft added across the original gabled section. Openings along the southern side have large doors with forged pins, catches and hinges. To the north of <b>the</b> <b>stables</b> are yards.|$|R

50|$|The main {{duties of}} <b>the</b> Royal <b>Stables</b> are {{to provide the}} Royal Family with transport.

50|$|The {{residence}} and <b>the</b> <b>stables,</b> with associated grounds including the gardens, paddocks and driveway, {{provide a good}} example of a mid-nineteenth century pastoral run. <b>The</b> <b>stables</b> are an excellent and intact example of a building of this type.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stable</b> {{originally}} had stalls for 116 healthy and 12 ill horses. <b>The</b> <b>stable</b> was insured for 12,000 Norwegian speciedaler, twice the amount {{for the head}} office building. The wagon depot had space for 28 trams and 16 sleds. The 16 sleds were purchased between 1875 and 1879, and replaced the horsecars during the winter. The forge had space for two smiths and featured a small room where the horses were shoed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stable</b> was {{designed}} by McKim, Mead & White and built in the late 19th century using the same yellow brick used for the main residence. <b>The</b> <b>stable</b> is {{two and a half}} stories high, 29 bays wide, and 5bays deep, and it has a gable roof covered with asbestos shingles that replaced its original ceramic tile. On the roof's ridge sits a shallow monitor, flanked by two taller octangular monitors with louvered ventilating elements and bell-cast copper roofs.|$|E

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> lead isotope 208Pb. Another actinium isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E
