5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (IT) region of S.thailandica showed that the species {{was part of the}} Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of the two—a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Jordan's {{description}} was published, several scientists noted <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> Mitsukurina and the extinct Mesozoic shark Scapanorhynchus. For a time, {{the prevailing}} view was to treat Mitsukurina {{as a junior}} synonym of Scapanorhynchus. Eventually, more complete fossils revealed many anatomical differences between Scapanorhynchus and Mitsukurina, leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera. Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This taxonomic confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat dander. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens may account for anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E
5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, he bought the rights and co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked on her body language and her voice to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological sign and one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|In his 1707 work Archaeologia Britannica Edward Lhuyd, {{keeper of}} the Ashmolean Museum, noted <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the two Celtic {{language}} families: Brythonic or P–Celtic (Breton, Cornish and Welsh); and Goidelic or Q–Celtic (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic). He argued that the Brythonic languages originated in Gaul (France), and that the Goidelic languages originated in the Iberian Peninsula. Lhuyd concluded that as the languages had been of Celtic origin, the people who spoke those languages were Celts. (According to a more recent hypothesis, also widely embraced today, Goidelic and Brythonic languages, collectively known as Insular Celtic languages, evolved together for some time separately from Continental Celtic languages such as Gaulish and Celtiberian.) From the 18th century, the peoples of Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts, and they are regarded as the modern Celtic nations today.|$|E

5|$|The {{three species}} of the {{subgenus}} Zanda have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the short-billed and the southern race xanthanotus of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. However, an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be {{more closely related to}} each other than to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} migration between the Nordic countries, but owing to <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> the cultures and languages (with {{the exception of}} Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group.

Similarly, there were 16,915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census. Although there are no certain numbers, some 40,000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom. Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.|$|E

5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{memory was}} revived {{in the art}} of late {{eighteenth-century}} French painters. His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E
