5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
5|$|Appearances {{and goals}} are {{composed}} of FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship, and FIFA Confederations Cup matches and each competition's required qualification matches, as well as numerous international friendly tournaments and matches.

Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out {{as shown in the}} diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E

5|$|Joule navigates {{the open}} world of Far Eden either on foot {{equipped}} with rocket boosters on {{her shoes and}} her back, across platforms with the grappling hook or via fast travel. The scenery may be altered by sandstorms, unveiling new areas to explore. Corebots can speak their own language called DigiMode, which <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> permitted to translate. Dungeons leading to progression in the story and containing resources {{that can be used}} for crafting are scattered throughout the world for Joule to unlock by way of collecting cores.|$|E
5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will know that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5000|$|The game first {{begins when}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> on a mountain. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> struck by {{lightning}} causing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to fall down the mountain.

5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (<b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
5|$|The list below {{includes}} all NK Maribor {{players who have}} made at least 100 official appearances for the club or who have been capped at full international level by their countries.

5|$|The {{rebirth of}} {{professional}} box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with {{the formation of}} the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz. The league originated with four teams: the Philadelphia Wings, New Jersey Saints, Washington Wave, and Baltimore Thunder, and unlike box lacrosse generally, was played during the winter. The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) immediately after its second season, and in 1998 renamed itself again, this time to the NLL. In 1998, the NLL entered into the Canadian market {{for the first time with}} the Ontario Raiders. Although 5 of the league's 9 teams are based in American cities, more than two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> Canadian.|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} meant to assist a {{basketball}} player in their practicing. The project hangs directly on the basketball rim and automatically rotates to find <b>the</b> <b>player</b> on <b>the</b> court. Once <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> detected, <b>the</b> automated basketball return system (ABRS) stays focused {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> so that any baskets successfully made will be funneled back to <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>player</b> moves from center, IR motion detectors find which direction you moved to and rotates accordingly, until <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> focused in front of the funnel again. If at any time <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> absent from <b>the</b> court or cannot be located, the rotation continues in a 180 degree sweeping motion until <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> picked up again...|$|R
5000|$|Peek: <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> shown their classmate's {{answer and}} may choose {{whether to go}} along with it or not. There is no {{obligation}} and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> free to lock in an alternative answer.|$|R
50|$|Before getting far, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{informed}} that shredded portions {{of a secret}} document containing Magma Ltd.'s plans for world domination have <b>been</b> stolen. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> instructed to retrieve the document by bargaining with the spies who stole it, who are located at various locations throughout <b>the</b> globe. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> warned {{that it must be}} retrieved in order to prevent the US government from thwarting their plans. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> objective <b>is</b> clear: retrieve the strips of the stolen document, then deliver them to Washington DC.|$|R
5|$|Tomb of Horrors {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a D {{campaign}} setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Rink - A game of Hockey will {{be played}} at the Victoria Skating Rink this evening, between two nines chose from among the members. Good fun may be expected, as some of <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> reputed to be {{exceedingly}} expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed {{on the part of}} intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> a {{high school}} boy on the fictional island of Yumegashima (夢ヶ島), Japan. They will find people on the island that will give <b>the</b> <b>player</b> quests, mostly to take {{pictures}} of schoolgirls' panties for a journalism club. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> caught doing so, they will either be reported to the police and taken into custody or be taken into the school counsellor's office (if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> caught taking pictures inside the school).|$|R
5000|$|During a fight, each boxer has a healthmeter that {{decreases}} whenever <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> hit.

25|$|John Brack's 1953 {{painting}} Three of the Players depicts three Collingwood players. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> {{thought by}} some to be Lou Richards, Jack Regan and Phonse Kyne.|$|E
25|$|However, in Total Football tactics, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> only loosely defined into a position. This tactic {{required}} {{players who}} were extremely versatile, such as Johan Cruyff, who could play every position on the pitch apart from goalkeeper.|$|E
50|$|The game plays {{similar to}} a board game, where <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a {{predetermined}} dice roll that moves <b>the</b> <b>player</b> up to six spaces on the board; however, if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> so given <b>the</b> choice, he can move to a space of his choosing {{if there is a}} fork in the road. After landing on a space, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a series of questions (The amount of questions needed to be answered increase as the game progresses) in order to proceed back to the board for another dice roll. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given a time limit to answer the question, with points given that vary based on how fast <b>the</b> <b>player</b> answered <b>the</b> question correctly. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> successful in answering a question, one of the gems above the enemy's picture will light up, indicating a correct answer. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> answers a question incorrectly, he will lose a life point. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> loses all life points, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must continue within the time limit or else the game is over.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{begins with}} a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player; “What do you {{remember}} about that day?” <b>The</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of [...] "that day", though at this time, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> {{not aware of the}} event's importance. Before the game actually begins, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core drawing mechanics.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the aids}} that the game {{provides}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> that past dialogue is accessible. Also, it contains a notebook which keeps track of what <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> searching for at any given point in the plot.|$|R
25|$|Multiplayer: Rampages {{have been}} {{modified}} to allow two players to complete them. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> both shown simultaneously on the screen, meaning they must stay within close proximity of each other. The multiplayer rampages provide such functionality.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of time-outs, clock {{stoppages}} requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> <b>are</b> allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>players</b> <b>are</b> {{able to use}} {{the inner}} camera to capture the {{expression}} of the player during multiplayer mode.

50|$|In any {{circumstance}} {{in which}} a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> forced to capture only the single card. For example, if the {{cards on the table}} are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or Fante in Italian), and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> plays another Knave, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> <b>is</b> only allowed to capture the Knave.|$|R
