25|$|It is {{impossible}} for me <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{an idea of the}} surprise and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail.

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about movies is how conventional they are, and then you have people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a sense {{of what it was like}} to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|The Book of est {{includes}} a one-page foreword by Werner Erhard. Erhard {{writes in the}} foreword that Rhinehart's book [...] "brilliantly ... communicates clearly to the reader both {{a sense of being}} in the training room and the spirit of what takes place there." [...] Erhard's foreword notes: [...] "although this book dramatizes the highlights of the training and attempts <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the vicarious experience of being at a training, this is a book, and the est experience cannot result from reading any book".|$|E
