5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. <b>The</b> <b>witches</b> encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|Charles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a {{streamlined}} {{version of}} the play which requires only eleven actors. The production strongly suggests that Lady Macbeth is in league with <b>the</b> <b>witches.</b> One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugène Ionesco's satirical {{version of the}} play Macbett (1972), one of <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> removes a costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing {{that she was not}} Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> gingerbread men instead. <b>The</b> <b>witches</b> like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
5|$|In {{modern times}} <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> {{have become the}} {{inspiration}} for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, {{and there is a}} Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates the landscape of the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>witch</b> {{takes out}} her wand and calls out, [...] "Stop!" [...] Hansel and Gretel are frozen {{to the spot}} where they stand. Using <b>the</b> wand, <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> leads Hansel to <b>the</b> cage. <b>The</b> <b>witch</b> leaves him stiff and slow of movement. She tells Gretel to be reasonable, and then <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> goes inside to fetch raisins and almonds with which to fatten Hansel. Hansel whispers to Gretel to pretend to obey <b>the</b> <b>witch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>witch</b> returns, and waving her wand, says, [...] "Hocus pocus, holderbush! Loosen, rigid muscles, hush!" [...] Using <b>the</b> wand, <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> forces Gretel to dance, then tells her to go into the house and set the table. Hansel pretends to be asleep, and <b>the</b> <b>witch,</b> {{overcome}} with excitement, describes how she plans to cook and eat Gretel.|$|R
50|$|Ozma and Dorothy {{try to come}} up with a plan to {{go against}} <b>the</b> <b>witch,</b> but all <b>the</b> magic in Oz is gone except for the belt, which <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> is now wearing. When Ozma tries to cast a spell on <b>the</b> <b>witch,</b> <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> turns Ozma into a stone statue, much to Dorothy's dismay. Bortag looks down on the scene as <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> tries to figure out what to do with Dorothy.|$|R
25|$|Edmund sneaks off {{to visit}} <b>the</b> <b>Witch.</b> When {{he arrives at}} her castle, she is angry {{that he did not}} deliver his siblings. <b>The</b> <b>Witch</b> sends wolves to hunt down the {{children}} and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in <b>the</b> <b>Witch's</b> dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. <b>The</b> <b>Witch</b> demands that Edmund reveal where his siblings are. After Tumnus claims that Edmund does not know anything, <b>The</b> <b>Witch</b> tells Mr. Tumnus that Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.|$|R
5|$|Justin Kurzel's hyperrealist 2015 Macbeth portrays <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> as {{poor women}} dabbling in {{witchcraft}} {{living off the}} countryside of Scotland with their children. While they appear amidst battles and make strangely accurate prophecies, they do not manifest anything supernatural otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Wicked: The Untold Story of <b>the</b> <b>Witches</b> of Oz is a Broadway musical {{with music}} and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It {{is based on the}} 1995 Gregory Maguire novel , an {{alternative}} telling of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is told from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.|$|E
5|$|A {{petition}} {{was presented}} to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw in 1998 asking for <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> to be pardoned, but {{it was decided that}} their convictions should stand. Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike. It followed the Swiss government's pardon earlier that year of Anna Göldi, beheaded in 1782, thought to be the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch.|$|E

5000|$|In the TV series Emerald City, <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> of <b>the</b> East (portrayed by Florence Kasumba) {{appears as}} guest star. In this version {{she was one}} of <b>the</b> last {{cardinal}} <b>witches</b> of Oz, known as <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> of <b>the</b> East [...] "the Mistress of the Eastern Wood, the Most Merciful and Stern". When Dorothy (Adria Arjona) arrives in Oz, she initially believes that she has killed <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> of <b>the</b> East when the police car she was in during the initial tornado hit <b>the</b> <b>Witch,</b> but it is later revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> survived this incident. She goes on to confront Dorothy and her new companion Lucas, refusing to accept Dorothy's explanation that her appearance was an accident. Faced with the prospect of torture until she gives <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> <b>the</b> answer she wants {{despite the fact that she}} is already telling the truth, Dorothy uses <b>the</b> <b>Witch's</b> current examination of a gun taken from the police car to trick her into pointing the gun at herself and pulling the trigger, blowing a hole through her head. After <b>the</b> <b>witch's</b> death, Dorothy 'inherits' her ruby-encrusted golden 'gloves', giving her potential access to <b>the</b> <b>Witch's</b> raw magical power even if she lacks control of it. The season finale states that only witches can kill <b>witches,</b> as <b>the</b> Wizard creates new guns to kill <b>the</b> remaining <b>witches</b> and they simply come back to life, but it appears likely that <b>the</b> <b>Witch</b> of <b>the</b> East remains dead as she technically killed herself.|$|R

5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of <b>the</b> <b>Witches</b> {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential {{in the development of the}} contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name of a character in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli created {{two other}} works {{depicting}} the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes {{had been done}} on horizontal canvases, giving the viewer {{a picture of the}} scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> are confidently perched atop a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren, open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.|$|E
5|$|One of the accused, Demdike, {{had been}} {{regarded}} {{in the area}} as a witch for fifty years, {{and some of the}} deaths <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event that seems to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.|$|E

Disappointed that he is so thin, <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> calls for Gretel to bring out raisins and almonds. As <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> tries to feed Hansel, Gretel steals the wand from <b>the</b> <b>witch's</b> pocket. Waving it towards Hansel, Gretel whispers, [...] "Hocus pocus, holderbush! Loosen rigid muscles, hush!" [...] As <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> turns around and wonders at the noise, Hansel discovers that he can move freely again.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>witch</b> tells Gretel to peek {{inside the}} oven {{to see if the}} {{gingerbread}} is done. Hansel softly calls out to her to be careful. Gretel pretends that she does not know what <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> means. <b>The</b> <b>witch</b> tells her to lift herself a little bit and bend her head forward. Gretel says that she is [...] "a goose" [...] and doesn't understand, then asks <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> to demonstrate. <b>The</b> <b>witch,</b> frustrated, opens <b>the</b> oven and leans forward. Hansel springs out of the cage, and he and Gretel shove <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> into <b>the</b> oven. They dance. The oven begins to crackle and the flames burn fiercely, and with a loud crash it explodes.|$|R
5|$|The Three Witches of Macbeth have {{inspired}} several painters {{over the years}} who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth's encounters with them. For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things {{were thought to be}} the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, {{as one of the first}} artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767–68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their heads together and their bodies unshown. Runciman's brother created another drawing of <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> called <b>The</b> <b>Witches</b> show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771–1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction to the power of the witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Witches,</b> 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then {{one of them will}} win.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use}} a subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E

5|$|Back in Sweden, Smetana {{found among}} his new pupils a young housewife, Fröjda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana {{transcribed}} two songs from Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin cycle, and transformed {{one of his}} own early piano pieces into a polka entitled Vision at the Ball. He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem Richard III, his first major orchestral composition since the Triumphal Symphony. He followed this with Wallenstein's Camp, inspired by Friedrich Schiller's Wallenstein drama trilogy, and began a third symphonic poem Hakon Jarl, based on the tragic drama by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger. Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: Macbeth and <b>the</b> <b>Witches,</b> and an Étude in C in the style of Liszt.|$|E

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} <b>the</b> <b>witches</b> {{later in the}} play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
