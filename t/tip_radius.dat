40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of poly (ethylene terephthalate) modified glycol (PETG) has been evaluated using notch sharpening techniques {{which could be}} grouped into contact and non-contact procedures. Razor blade tapping, razor blade sliding, razor pressing and broaching {{are part of the}} first group, while the femtolaser technique belongs to the second one. Not all the contact procedures generated valid sharp cracks for fracture parameter assessment; indeed none of the samples sharpened via razor sliding generated acceptable sharp cracks. The results revealed that the non-contact femtolaser technique produced the sharpest cracks in this polymer, with crack <b>tip</b> <b>radii</b> of only 0. 5 μm, leading to the lowest {{fracture toughness}} values. On the contrary, the traditional notch sharpening technique based on razor tapping, recommended in ISO, ESIS and ASTM protocols and standards, generated larger crack <b>tip</b> <b>radii</b> than those introduced via femtolaser and, consequently, resulted in higher fracture toughness values.

50|$|Application of FIM, like FEM, {{is limited}} by the {{materials}} which can be fabricated {{in the shape of a}} sharp tip, can be used in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) environment, and can tolerate the high electrostatic fields. For these reasons, refractory metals with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FIM experiments. Metal tips for FEM and FIM are prepared by electropolishing (electrochemical polishing) of thin wires. However, these tips usually contain many asperities. The final preparation procedure involves the in situ removal of these asperities by field evaporation just by raising the tip voltage. Field evaporation is a field induced process which involves the removal of atoms from the surface itself at very high field strengths and typically occurs in the range 2-5 V/Å. The effect of the field in this case is to reduce the effective binding energy of the atom to the surface and to give, in effect, a greatly increased evaporation rate relative to that expected at that temperature at zero fields. This process is self-regulating since the atoms that are at positions of high local curvature, such as adatoms or ledge atoms, are removed preferentially. The tips used in FIM is sharper (<b>tip</b> <b>radius</b> is 100~300 Å) compared to those used in FEM experiments (<b>tip</b> <b>radius</b> ~1000 Å).|$|E

50|$|There are {{considerations}} {{which need}} {{to be taken into account}} when determining which mode is optimal for sampling for a given application. It has been shown that sampling in contact mode with very soft samples can damage the sample and render it useless for further studies. Sampling in non-contact mode is less destructive to the sample, but the tip is more likely to drift out of contact with the surface and thus it may not record data. Drifting of the tip is also seen due to piezo hysteresis, which causes displacement due to molecular friction and polarization effects due to the applied electric field.It is important to note the correlation between resolution and curvature of <b>tip</b> <b>radius.</b> Early STM tips used by Binning and Rohrer were fairly large, anywhere between some hundred nm to 1 µm in radius. In more recent work, the <b>tip</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature was mentioned as 10-40 nm. By reducing the radius of curvature of the tip, it allows for the enhanced detection of deviations within the OPVs surface morphology. Tips often {{need to be}} replaced due to tip rounding, which leads to a decrease in the resolution. Tip rounding occurs due to the loss of outermost atoms present at the apex of the tip which can be a result of excessive force applied or character of the sample.|$|E
50|$|At higher temperatures, {{the yield}} {{strength}} decreases, {{and leads to}} the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack <b>tip</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature results in a higher toughness.|$|E
