5|$|Cowell {{stated in}} an {{interview}} during the broadcast week of the first series that he hoped a second series would go ahead, {{and that he had}} received three separate approaches from the United States to create an American version.

5|$|On 8 September 2017, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> Dwarf XII would begin broadcasting on Dave on 12 October 2017, and on 15 September 2017 it was further announced that each episode would preview a week earlier via the UKTV Play video on demand service, effectively meaning that Series 12 would be starting on 5 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Brooks is paroled {{after serving}} 50 years, but he cannot {{adjust to the}} outside world, and he commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy {{receives}} a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, earning a spell in solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias Randall Stephens.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultures}} {{that did not}} recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, {{and other parts of}} the world. Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England. Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing <b>that</b> <b>red</b> light reduced scarring, this belief persisted even until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{the core}} of <b>that</b> <b>Reds</b> team {{actually}} had {{the best record in}} the Major Leagues in 1981, but did not make the postseason that year because of Bowie Kuhn's split-season playoff format due to the player's strike.|$|R

5|$|One {{field study}} found <b>that</b> <b>red</b> wattlebirds foraged {{for longer periods}} when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, {{this could have been}} because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} <b>that</b> <b>red</b> ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is <b>that</b> <b>red</b> represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E

5|$|The regimental colours of green, red and yellow, {{which appear}} on the regimental tie and Stable belt, were decided on in the late 19th century. One officer (who was also a Conservative MP) {{suggested}} green with a red stripe, but this was objected to because it {{was similar to the}} Rifle Brigade. Another officer (a Liberal MP) suggested adding yellow, which was agreed. The joke was <b>that</b> <b>red</b> and yellow were Liberal colours, and the Liberal MP got away with this under his rival's nose.|$|E
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter.

Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping {{to get to the bottom}} of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered <b>that</b> <b>red</b> and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E

5|$|Before modern times, {{buildings}} were usually constructed of local materials, including wood, thatch etc. The Nook in Oulton (dated 1611) {{is a rare}} example of an original half-timbered house. Of the more durable materials, there are three rocks which have been substantially used. These are gritstone (a sort of sandstone) found {{to the north and}} west (e.g. Kirstall Abbey, Leeds Town Hall or Harewood House), different sandstones in the Yorkshire Coal Measures, and limestone to the north and east, as is shown in older villages (now suburbs) in these directions. To the south of the city are substantial clay deposits, so <b>that</b> <b>red</b> brick has been the predominant building material for the extensive nineteenth century housing. The particularly fine clay found in Burmantofts led to a decorative covering of terracotta or glazed Architectural Faience being used on both interior and exterior walls of important buildings.|$|E
5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India {{about the need for}} an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating <b>that</b> <b>red</b> stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.|$|E
5|$|Ngwat-Mahop {{played in}} Red Bull Salzburg's opening {{match for the}} 2010–11 Bundesliga season, on 17 July 2010, coming in as a {{substitute}} in the 57th minute, in what was a 0–0 away draw against SV Kapfenberg. Three days later he once again played {{as a substitute for}} Jakob Jantscher, in his team's second leg match, against Faroese champions HB Torshavn for the second Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. He scored his first goal of the season in a match for the 1st round of the ÖFB-Cup against St. Pölten II, <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> Bull Salzburg won by 1–4. On 24 August, he made the cross that resulted in Red BullSalzburg's goal, in his team's second leg match for the third Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League against Hapoel Tel Aviv. Ngwat-Mahop was substituted in the 65th minute of a match that ended an 1–1 draw, resulting in Red Bull Salzburg's elimination. Later it was made known that he was again injured, and due to this he made his come back with Red Bull Salzburg almost three months later, in a 2–0 home win against Sturm Graz. That was meant to be Ngwat-Mahop's last game with the Red Bull Salzburg shirt, as in January he was sold to Greek Superleague outfit Iraklis Thessaloniki for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} <b>that</b> <b>Red</b> Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a coupon rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a coupon rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook page <b>that</b> <b>Red,</b> {{the main}} protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes colonised the North American {{continent}} in two waves: {{during or}} before the Illinoian glaciation, {{and during the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>red</b> foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and that the previous binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, red fox fossils {{have been found in}} Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) refugium occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.v.alascensis, V.v.abietorum, V.v.regalis, and V.v.rubricosa. The southern (or montane) refugium occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.v.macroura, V.v.cascadensis, and V.v.necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations.|$|E
