25|$|Between 1937 and 1939, {{a number}} of {{military}} vehicles numbered from 151 to 162 were introduced. These were painted army green and consisted of a medium and a light tank, an Austin 7 military car, a six-wheeled truck, a reconnaissance car, a searchlight lorry, an anti aircraft gun, a light Dragon tractor with limber and 19 pdr gun. Most interesting were several fairly detailed trailers, including: amler, cooker trailer and water <b>tank</b> <b>trailer.</b> The military offerings were produced through 1941 though a few select models – the clever 161b Anti-Aircraft Gun, the 151a medium tank {{and some of the}} trailers – were also made again in 1946–1955 after the war (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E

50|$|The {{dancing at}} Shelly’s Leg {{came to an}} abrupt end at around 1am on December 4, 1975. A fuel truck {{carrying}} an attached <b>tank</b> <b>trailer</b> struck a guardrail and jackknifed on the slick asphalt of the lower deck of the nearby Highway 99 viaduct near South Washington and South Main streets. The trailer detached from the truck, hit a roadway column, overturned and split open, spilling a river of flaming fuel onto the cars of a Burlington Northern Railway train, some parked vehicles and the building housing Shelly’s Leg. The wall of fire was so hot, it shattered the disco’s windows. Everyone made it out safely through a rear door.|$|E

This paper dis-cusses a study on the use of glass fiber reinforced composite leaf springs for commercial vehicles, particularly for heavy <b>tank</b> <b>trailer</b> suspension systems. A general discussion on the analysis and design of constant width, variable thickness composite springs is pre-sented. An example is given for the design of a composite spring for one of a <b>tank</b> <b>trailer</b> fleet. This spring is three inches wide with a maximum thickness of about two inches. Several dozen springs were fabricated according to the design and road tested on tank trailers. In general, the road test results demonstrated the applicability of glass fiber rein-forced composite springs for trailer suspensions.

50|$|Methylamine is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with a formula of CH3NH2. This colorless gas is a derivative of ammonia, but with one hydrogen atom {{being replaced by}} a methyl group. It is the simplest primary amine. It is sold as a solution in methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, or water, or as the anhydrous gas in pressurized metal containers. Industrially, methylamine is transported in its anhydrous form in pressurized railcars and <b>tank</b> <b>trailers.</b> It has a strong odor similar to fish.

50|$|Tank {{container}} chassis, {{also referred}} to as tank chassis, drop frame chassis or <b>tank</b> <b>trailers,</b> are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid containers or ISO tank containers. They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the tank container revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop frame chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|R

40|$|It is {{expected}} {{in the near future}} that more and more fresh nuclear fuel will be transported in a variety of transport packages to cope with increasing demand from nuclear fuel cycle facilities. Accordingly, safety demonstration analyses are planned and conducted at JAERI under contract with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan. These analyses are conducted for the purpose of gaining public acceptance of such nuclear fuel activities in a four-year plan from fiscal 2001 to 2004 year to verify integrity of packaging against leakage of radioactive material {{in the case of a}} severe accident postulated to occur during transportation. In order to create the accident scenarios, actual transportation routes were surveyed, accident or incident records were tracked, international radioactive material transport regulations such as IAEA rules were investigated and thus, accident conditions leading to mechanical damages and thermal failure to a cask were identified to characterize the scenarios. As a result, the worst-case conditions of run-off-the-road accidents were set up to define the impact against a concrete or asphalt surface. For fire accident scenarios to be set up, collisions were assumed to occur with an oil <b>tank</b> <b>trailer</b> carrying lots of inflammable material in open air, or with a commonly used two-ton-truck inside a tunnel without ventilation.

40|$|LNG is the {{abbreviation}} for liquefied natural gas, which {{is recognized as}} one of the world’s clean energies. LNG is one product at natural gas that through purification and ultra-low temperature is liquefied. The liquefied natural gas is very suitable for LNG transportation by a truck. China is a big country rich in natural resources. The use of natural gas is in favor of Chinese energy structure adjustment. It has important strategic significance to improve the ecological environment and the quality of people’s lives. A LNG carrier vehicle is a cryogenic liquid tanker truck used to transport liquefied natural gas in an ultra-low temperature environment. Because LNG is flammable, explosive, and cryogenic and so on, it is very important the safety design of LNG carrier vehicle demanded in the road transport safety. LNG carrier vehicles usually consist of LNG cryogenic liquid storage <b>tanks,</b> <b>trailer</b> running gears, piping systems, a control box and other components. Among them prone to accidents are mainly LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks and safety accessories. This paper dealt with the safety design research to these two systems.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} to model, evaluate and verify the safety benefits of an improved {{version of the}} Roll Advisor and Controller (RA&C) on-board safety system. A U. S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Vehicle Initiative (IVI) Field Operational Test (FOT) led by Freightliner evaluated an RA&C on-board safety system. The RA&C system assists commercial vehicle drivers, especially drivers of tanker trucks, to avoid rollover crashes. The RA&C is comprised of two components that perform two distinct functions: to inform drivers when they have performed a maneuver with {{a high risk of}} rollover (the roll stability advisor [RSA] component), and to initiate autonomous braking to prevent a rollover (the roll stability control [RSC] component). All of the data analyzed in this report came from the Freightliner IVI FOT. Data were collected on six Freightliner tractors pulling <b>tank</b> <b>trailers</b> of liquid nitrogen in revenue service during late 2000 through 2001. The methods for estimating the benefits of a safety system were developed by Battelle as part of the independent evaluation of the FOT.

40|$|Four broad {{approaches}} to decreasing {{the number of}} cargo tank rollovers were evaluated: driver training, electronic stability aids, improvements in design of the vehicle itself, and highway design. A study of rollover crash statistics confirmed many expectations, {{but a few of}} the factors were not as strong as might have been expected. The portion of rollovers that occur on freeways is 15 to 20. A driver error of one kind or another (e. g., decision or performance error) figures in about three-fourths of cargo tank rollovers. Inattention and distraction account for about 15. Evasive maneuvers were a factor in 5 to 10 of rollovers. Drivers must be trained to appreciate the diverse causes for rollovers and to anticipate the situations that lead to them. Adherence to viable work and rest schedules is crucial. Electronic stability aids automatically slow the truck when it rounds a curve too fast. They can be remarkably effective in preventing this scenario. However, crash statistics and anecdotal accounts consistently show many other factors that can lead to rollovers. Significant reductions in rollover rates can be achieved with modest changes in vehicle stability. Cargo <b>tank</b> <b>trailers</b> of improved stability are currently available for some cargoes. When mountainous terrain or other factors dictate highway designs that can contribute to rollovers, drivers need to be made aware through signage or dispatch instructions. A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis, conducted from a societal point of view during a 20 -year window, projected that the improvements will be cost beneficial...|$|R
