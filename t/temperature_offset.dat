40|$|In {{this paper}} two tunable {{two-dimensional}} gas chromatography setups are compared and described {{in which the}} secondary dimension consists of two different capillary columns coupled in series. In the first setup the selectivity of the second dimension can be tuned by adjusting the effective column length of the first secondary dimension column, simply by sliding it stepwise back or forward through the GC x GC modulator. In the second setup, in which the first secondary dimension column is installed in a separate GC-oven (oven- 2), the overall selectivity of the second dimension can be tuned by adjusting the oven- 2 <b>temperature</b> <b>offset</b> {{with respect to the}} main oven. The contribution of the first secondary dimension column to the overall secondary dimension separation can be decreased by applying a higher <b>temperature</b> <b>offset.</b> A real-life sample, the headspace of a coffee powder, was used to demonstrate the added value of tunable GC x GC by solving coelutions of some specific aroma compounds. Besides optimizing the overall GC x GC separation, by altering the second dimension column selectivity, these set-ups also offer enhanced possibilities for qualitative analysis. By stepwise altering the selectivity of the second dimension, classes of compounds showing similar retention behavior could be discriminated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Automatic fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) {{can help enhance}} building energy efficiency by facilitating early detection of occurrence of system faults, especially those of air-conditioning systems, thus enabling rectification of the faults before much energy is wasted due to such faults. However, building owners may not invest in FDD unless they are convinced of the energy cost savings that can be achieved. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> stuck VAV box damper, supply air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking cooling coil valve. The simulation results indicate that some faults may significantly increase energy use in buildings, for example, negative room air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> stuck open VAV box damper, negative supply air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> stuck open outdoor air damper and stuck open and leaking cooling coil valve. Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available. Some other faults, e. g. positive supply air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> positive room air <b>temperature</b> sensor <b>offset,</b> stuck closed cooling coil valve and stuck closed VAV box damper, may allow less energy to be used but will lead to unbearable indoor environmental conditions, such as high indoor temperature. Such faults, therefore, can easily be detected even without a FDD system, as there will be feedback from the building occupants. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|PosterThe steep rockwalls of the Mont Blanc massif {{have been}} {{affected}} by an increase in rockfall activity in the last decades. Permafrost degradation is suggested as the most likely triggering factor. To better understand geomorphic processes we investigate permafrost distribution and address questions on its pattern in steep alpine bedrock. We use GIS-modeling to simulate Mean Annual Rock Surface Temperature (MARST) distribution. Rock temperature measurements including three 10 -m-deep borehole monitoring at the Aiguille du Midi (AdM, 3842 m a. s. l) serve to estimate the <b>temperature</b> <b>offset</b> (i. e. temperature difference between rock surface and depth of negligible inter-annual temperature varibility). The estimation of the lower extent of permafrost distribution is derived from a combination of both approaches and hypotheses on permafrost occurrence are evaluated with Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements. The MARST model indicates that the 0 °C isotherm extends down to 2600 m a. s. l in the most shaded faces and rises up to 3800 m in the most sun-exposed areas. According to recent literature and the AdM borehole thermal profiles, we postulate that permafrost could extends down below MARST reaching up to 3 °C due to <b>temperature</b> <b>offset</b> processes. ERT measurements performed along 160 -m-long profiles at six different sites which the top are located from 3360 m a. s. l to 2760 m a. s. l and the MARST range from 3 °C are the first of this kind. Five of sites are located in the granite area making them directly comparable. They all show high resistivity values at depth (> 200 k) interpreted as permafrost bodies. Lower resistivity values (< 90 k) are found either above the high resistivity bodies and interpreted as thawed active layer, or below MARST warmer than 2 - 3 °C and interpreted as non-perenially frozen rock. Two sites were measured in autumn 2012 and autumn 2013 allowing for time-lapse investigation which demonstrates the change in resistivity in repeated measurements. These preliminary results could confirm that steep alpine bedrock permafrost exists below surface tempera- ture reaching up to 3 °C. A temperature-resistivity calibration will be performed in a freezing laboratory at the Technical University of Munich to better assess ERT results and their interpretation in terms of permafrost occurrence and interannual change...|$|E

The first two make up Martinson’s salt deficit and are the salt input needed to increase {{the density of the}} mixed layer and the pycnocline layer to that of the deep water (the mixed layer stability and pycnocline layer stability, respectively).

Five filter samples and two sucrose solutions were analysed with both the EUSAAR 2 and NIOSH 870 thermal protocols. z scores were calculated for total carbon (TC); nine outliers and three stragglers were identified. Three outliers and eight stragglers were found for EC. Overall, the participants provided results between the warning levels with the exception of two laboratories that showed poor performance, the causes of which were identified and corrected through the course of the comparison exercise. The TC repeatability and reproducibility (expressed as relative standard deviations) were 11 and 15 % for EUSAAR 2 and 9. 2 and 12 % for NIOSH 870; the standard deviations for EC were 15 and 20 % for EUSAAR 2 and 20 and 26 % for NIOSH 870. TC was in good agreement between the two protocols, TC NIOSH 870 = 0. 98 × TC EUSAAR 2 (R 2 = 1. 00, robust means). Transmittance (TOT) calculated EC for NIOSH 870 was found to be 20 % lower than for EUSAAR 2, EC NIOSH 870 = 0. 80 × EC EUSAAR 2 (R 2 = 0. 96, robust means). The thermograms and laser signal values were compared and similar peak patterns were observed per sample and protocol for most participants. Notable deviations from the typical patterns indicated either the absence or inaccurate application of the temperature calibration procedure and/or pre-oxidation during the inert phase of the analysis. Low or zero pyrolytic organic carbon (POC), as reported by a few participants, is suggested as an indicator of an instrument-specific pre-oxidation. A sample-specific pre-oxidation effect was observed for filter G, for all participants and both thermal protocols, indicating the presence of oxygen donors on the suspended particulate matter.
