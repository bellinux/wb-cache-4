40|$|In this paper, 1997 {{atmospheric}} visibility data {{as an indicator}} for the presence and density of fog at our ecosystem research site in the Fichtelgebirge mountains, Central Europe, are presented. At this location (about 800 m a. s. l.), fog occurred on 50 % of the days and added up to a <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> duration of 1158 h in 1997. Using the visibility as a determining parameter, an automatic system for the collection of fog water was developed, including an automatic sampler, and sampling on an event basis. The data from the summer 1997 season exhibit a large variability in the chemical composition of fog. Easterly winds were associated with fog with higher concentrations of the major ions (NH`...|$|E
40|$|Fog {{frequency}} at Kushiro, Hokkaido Island, Japan, during midsummer depends strongly on the advection of sea fog {{from the}} ocean onto the land, which itself depends {{on the behavior of}} the North Pacific High (NPH). This study investigates the relationship between unusually high fog frequency at Kushiro during early autumn in 2012 and the NPH extension. The <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> frequency during mid-August through mid-September in 2012 was the highest over the past 32 years. A northwestward expansion of the NPH caused anomalous southerly winds, that transported warm moist air onto the southeast coast of Hokkaido Island. This warm moist southerly flow favors the onshore advection of sea fog, as it does during midsummer. During early autumn in 2012, the warm advection also results in a large temperature difference between atmosphere and sea over the cold Oyashio current, which suggests that an increase in sea fog generation is another important factor for the high fog frequency at Kushiro...|$|E
40|$|The fog water {{chemistry}} and deposition in northern Japan were investigated by fog water and throughfall measurements in 2010. Fog water was sampled week-ly by an active-string fog sampler at Lake Mashu from May to November. Throughfall measurements were conducted using rain gauges under three deciduous {{trees along the}} somma of the lake from August to October. The mean fog deposition rate (flux) was cal-culated using throughfall data to estimate the <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> water deposition amount for the entire sampling period. NH 4 + and SO 42 - were the most abundant ca-tion and anion, respectively, in the fog water samples. A mean pH of 5. 08 in the fog water, which is higher than those in rural areas in Japan, was observed. The [NH 4 +]/[SO 42 -] equivalent ratio in fog water was larger than 1. 0 throughout the study period, indicat-ing that NH 3 gas was the primary neutralizing agent for fog water acidity. The mean rate and total amount of fog water deposition were estimated as 0. 15 mm h- 1 and 164 mm, respectively. The amounts of nitro-gen and sulfate deposition via fog water deposition were corresponded to those reported values of the annual deposition amounts via rainfall...|$|E
40|$|The occult {{deposition}} of nutrients and pollutants, such as ammonium (NH 4), nitrate (NO 3), and sulfate (SO 4), {{and other major}} ions, {{has not yet been}} quantified at the "Waldstein" research site in a montane forest ecosystem in Central Europe. An eddy covariance measuring system, consisting of an ultrasonic anemometer and a fast ground based fog droplet spectrometer, was used to determine turbulent fogwater deposition fluxes. For the additional quantification of deposition fluxes of ions, fog water was collected on a single event basis for chemical analysis. First results from a field campaign from late June through early December 2000 show a contribution of 4. 5 % of fog water to the total water input. For NH 4, and SO 4, the contribution of fogwater deposition in <b>total</b> (rain + <b>fog)</b> deposition is estimated as 44 %, 51 %, and 52 %, respectively...|$|R
50|$|After an {{ineffective}} {{attack by}} L 10 on Tyneside on 15-16 June the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months, {{and the remaining}} Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August. On 9-10 August, four Zeppelins were directed against London; none reached its target and one, L 12, was damaged by ground fire near Dover and came down in the sea off Zeebrugge. Despite eight attacks by RNAS aircraft the airship was towed into Ostend where it was later dismantled. The four-Zeppelin raid was repeated on 12-13 August; again only one airship, L 10, made landfall, dropping its bombs on Harwich. A third four-Zeppelin raid tried to reach London on 17-18 August; two turned back with mechanical problems, one bombed Ashford, Kent in the belief it was Woolwich, but L 10 became the first Navy airship to reach London. L 10 was also misnavigated, mistaking the reservoirs of the Lea Valley for the Thames, and consequently dropped its bombs on Walthamstow and Leytonstone. 10 people were killed, 48 injured and property damage was estimated at £30,750. Guns were fired at L 10 and a few aircraft took off in pursuit, but the Zeppelin suffered no damage. L 10 was destroyed {{a little over two}} weeks later: it was struck by lightning and caught fire off Cuxhaven, and the entire crew was killed.Two Army Zeppelins successfully bombed London on 7-8 September: SL 2 dropped bombs on the Isle of Dogs, Deptford, Greenwich and Woolwich, and LZ 74 was forced to drop weight on its approach and scattered 39 bombs over Cheshunt, before heading on to London and dropping bombs on Bermondsey, Rotherhithe and New Cross. Eighteen people were killed and 28 injured; property damage <b>totalled</b> £9,616. <b>Fog</b> and mist prevented any aircraft taking off, but anti-aircraft guns fired at LZ 74 with no effect.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the variability of poor visibility events occurring hourly in the UAE and their relationship to climate dynamics. Hourly visibility observation data spanning more than three decades from ten stations across the country were used. Four intervals of low visibility, between 0. 10 km and 5. 0 km, were considered. Poor visibility records were analyzed under wet and dry weather conditions. The Mann–Kendall test was used to assess the inferred trends of low visibility records. The relationships between poor visibility measurements and associated meteorological variables and climate oscillations were also investigated. Results show that Fujairah city has the highest average visibility values under wet weather conditions, while Abu Dhabi city has the lowest average visibility values under both wet and dry conditions. Wet weather conditions had a greater impact than dry weather conditions on visibility deterioration in seven out of the ten stations. Results confirm that fog and dust contribute significantly to the deterioration of visibility in the UAE and that Abu Dhabi has been more impacted by those events than Dubai. Furthermore, the numbers of fog and dust events show steep increasing trends for both cities. A change point in poor visibility records triggered by fog and dust events was detected around the year 1999 at Abu Dhabi and Dubai stations after the application of the cumulative sum method. Increasing shifts in the means and the variances were noticed in the <b>total</b> annual <b>fog</b> events when Student’s t-test and Levene’s test were applied. In Abu Dhabi, the mean annual number of dust events was approximately 112. 5 before 1999, increasing to 337 dust events after 1999. In Dubai, the number of dust events increased from around 85. 5 to 315. 6 events. The inferred fog and dust trends were compared to four climate indices. Results showed a significant correlation (positive and negative) between four climate indices and the occurrence of fog and dust events in the UAE...|$|R
40|$|Fog {{is thought}} to {{influence}} ecological function in coastal forests worldwide, yet few data are available that illuminate the mechanisms underlying this influence. In a California redwood forest we measured water and nitrogen (N) fluxes from horizontally moving fog and vertically delivered rain as well as redwood tree function. The spatial heterogeneity of water and N fluxes, water availability, tree water use, and canopy N processing varied greatly across seasons. Water and N fluxes to soil (annual average of 98 % and 89 %, respectively) across the whole forest occurred primarily in the rain season and was relatively even across the whole forest. In contrast, below-canopy flux of fog water and N declined exponentially from the windward edge to the forest interior. Following large fog events, soil moisture was greater at the windward edge {{than anywhere else in}} the forest. Physiological activity in redwoods reflected these differences in inputs across seasons: tree physiological responses did not vary spatially in the rain season, but in the fog season, water use was greater, yet water stress was less, in trees at the windward edge of the forest versus the interior. In both seasons, vertical passage through the forest changed the amount of water and form and concentration of N, revealing the role of the tree canopy in processing atmospheric inputs. Although <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> water inputs were comparatively small, they may have important ecosystem functions, including relief of canopy water stress and, where there is fog drip, functional coupling of above- and belowground processes...|$|E
40|$|Breakup of sea ice causes {{advection}} {{and steam}} fog, {{which can be}} persistent over oceans and coasts but diminishes inland. Arctic warming has increased summer sea ice decline and open water exposure, affecting heat and moisture fluxes and therefore cloud formation. Cloudiness has generally increased over the Arctic, but trends differ with cloud vertical distribution as well as seasonally and spatially, with disparate patterns over broken sea ice, open ocean and land. The few studies that separate fog from other clouds report {{a slight increase in}} sea fog and slight decrease in land fog over the past decades, but regional and pan-Arctic patterns are equivocal. No studies have focussed on the coast-to-inland transition zone, where many ice sheet outlets and glaciers terminate and where it is suggested that fog and related temperature inversions suppress glacier melt. In this study, we investigate whether melt season fog frequency and timing has changed in coastal regions around the Greenland Sea over the past 50 - 70 years. Fog occurrence and characteristics were analysed using synoptic weather data from East Greenland, Jan Mayen, Svalbard and Iceland national and research stations, supplemented with Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive and International Arctic Buoy Programme data. A multivariate fog detection model was developed on the basis weather stations with direct (visibility) and indirect (temperature, relative humidity, wind) fog data. This fog detection model was then applied to stations without direct fog observations, after which daily to seasonal trends in peak frequencies, <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> occurrence, and spatiotemporal patterns could be analysed for all Greenland Sea coastal regions. Occurrence of Arctic sea fog coincides with the glacier ablation season and peaks in July/August. Using fog layer height and fog properties from radiosonde data we calculated fog penetration onto glaciers and determined effects on the radiation budget...|$|E
40|$|Dryland {{ecosystems}} cover 40 % of {{the total}} land surface on Earth and are defined broadly as zones where precipitation is considerably less than the potential evapotranspiration. Nonrainfall waters (for example, fog and dew) are the least-studied and least-characterized components of the hydrological cycle, although they supply critical amounts of water for dryland ecosystems. The sources of nonrainfall waters are largely unknown for most systems. In addition, most field and modeling studies tend to consider all nonrainfall inputs as a single category because of technical constraints, which hinders prediction of dryland responses to future warming conditions. This study uses multiple stable isotopes (2 H, 18 O, and 17 O) to show that fog and dew have multiple origins and that groundwater in drylands can be recycled via evapotranspiration and redistributed to the upper soil profile as nonrainfall water. Surprisingly, the non–ocean-derived (locally generated) fog {{accounts for more than}} half of the <b>total</b> <b>fog</b> events, suggesting a potential shift from advection-dominated fog to radiation-dominated fog in the fog zone of the Namib Desert. This shift will have implications on the flora and fauna distribution in this fog-dependent system. We also demonstrate that fog and dew can be differentiated on the basis of the dominant fractionation (equilibrium and kinetic) processes during their formation using the 17 O- 18 O relationship. Our results are of great significance in an era of global climate change where the importance of nonrainfall water increases because rainfall is predicted to decline in many dryland ecosystems. Fog and dew in the Namib Desert have multiple origins and their formation can be differentiated using stable isotopes.

40|$|Fogwater, fog drip and {{rainwater}} chemistry {{were examined}} at a tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, southwest China between November 2001 and October 2002. During {{the period of}} observation, 204 days with the occurrence of radiation fog were observed and the <b>total</b> duration of <b>fog</b> was 1949 h, of which 1618 h occurred in the dry season (November to April), accounting for 37. 0 % of the time during the season. The mean pH of fogwater, fog drip and rainwater were 6. 78, 7. 30, and 6. 13, respectively. The ion with the highest concentration for fog- and rainwater was HCO 3 -, which amounted to 85. 2 and 37. 3 mu eq l(- 1), followed by Ca 2 +, Mg- 2 + and NH 4 +. Concentrations of NO 3 -, HCO 3 -, NH 4 +, Ca 2 +, and K+ in fogwater samples collected in the dry season were significantly greater when compared to those collected in the rainy season. It {{was found that the}} ionic concentrations in fog drip were higher than those in fogwater, except for NH 4 + and H+, which was attributed to the washout of the soil- and ash-oriented ions deposited on the leaves and the alkaline ionic emissions by the leaves, since biomass burns are very common in the region and nearby road was widening...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{that use}} fog as an {{important}} water-source frequently have a rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the "narrow-leaf syndrome" should increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The <b>total</b> amount of <b>fog</b> intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can {{only have a few}} blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave {{as a result of their}} dependence on fog...|$|R
40|$|External cueing is a {{potentially}} effective strategy to reduce freezing of gait (FOG) in persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Case reports suggest that three-dimensional (3 D) cues {{might be more}} effective in reducing FOG than two-dimensional cues. We investigate the usability of 3 D augmented reality visual cues delivered by smart glasses in comparison to conventional 3 D transverse bars on the floor and auditory cueing via a metronome in reducing FOG and improving gait parameters. In laboratory experiments, 25 persons with PD and FOG performed walking tasks while wearing custom-made smart glasses under five conditions, at the end-of-dose. For two conditions, augmented visual cues (bars/staircase) were displayed via the smart glasses. The control conditions involved conventional 3 D transverse bars on the floor, auditory cueing via a metronome, and no cueing. The number of FOG episodes and percentage of time spent on FOG were rated from video recordings. The stride length and its variability, cycle time and its variability, cadence, and speed were calculated from motion data collected with a motion capture suit equipped with 17 inertial measurement units. A <b>total</b> of 300 <b>FOG</b> episodes occurred in 19 out of 25 participants. There were no statistically significant differences in number of FOG episodes and percentage of time spent on FOG across the five conditions. The conventional bars increased stride length, cycle time, and stride length variability, while decreasing cadence and speed. No effects for the other conditions were found. Participants preferred the metronome most, and the augmented staircase least. They suggested to improve the comfort, esthetics, usability, field of view, and stability of the smart glasses on the head and to reduce their weight and size. In their current form, augmented visual cues delivered by smart glasses are not beneficial for persons with PD and FOG. This could be attributable to distraction, blockage of visual feedback, insufficient familiarization with the smart glasses, or display of the visual cues in the central rather than peripheral visual field. Future smart glasses are required to be more lightweight, comfortable, and user friendly to avoid distraction and blockage of sensory feedback, thus increasing usability...|$|R
