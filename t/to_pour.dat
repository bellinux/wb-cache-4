In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> banana baby food on his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely harm the young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a primal covenant in Jewish studies.|$|E
5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square.

5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we quantitatively studied the {{opportunities}} to improve the compaction of dried wastewater treatment sludges from tanneries, possibly combining with pelletization. Measurements of bulk density {{have been carried out}} at the industrial and laboratory scale, using different packing procedures, amenable to industrial processes. Waste as powder, pellets and their mixtures have been considered. Mixtures of powder and pellets is the best packing policy. The best compaction results was achieved by controlled vibration of a 30 / 70 %wt mixture of powders and pellets, leading to a final bulk density of 1 t/m 3, i. e. an improvement of compaction by more than 54 % with respect <b>to</b> <b>poured</b> powders, but also larger than 35 % compared <b>to</b> <b>poured</b> pellets. That means increasing the mass storage capacity by a factor of 1. 56...|$|R

From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war.

Construction on the west entrance and its {{cut and cover tunnel}} under Broadway began in November 2013 and required lane shifts on Broadway throughout 2014.

5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties.

5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns and began <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> cannon fire {{into the rear}} of the 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years.|$|E

5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were {{suspended}} with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University.

At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and a textbook, Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain {{fell on the}} Sacramento region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of the}} most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood in studies conducted after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E

After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting <b>to</b> <b>pour</b> into Sam.

When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
