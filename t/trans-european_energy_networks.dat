40|$|The Russian-Ukrainian gas {{crisis of}} January 2009, {{occurring}} {{three years after}} a similar dispute between Moscow and Kyiv had disrupted Russian natural gas supplies to Europe, led many European commentators to question the continued reliability of Russia as a supplier of natural gas. The role of Ukraine as an energy transit state was also put under the spotlight. The January 2009 crisis followed the conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008. This brief war had compelled governments in member states of the European Union (EU) to reconsider the wisdom of being dependent for over 40 percent of their gas imports from an increasingly emboldened and aggressive Russia. Attention has focussed more on developing projects which would supply natural gas to Europe from sources other than Russia along routes which would bypass Russian territory. The so-called “fourth” or “southern” gas corridor connecting the Caspian and Gulf regions and the Middle East to Europe (the other three corridors running to EU member states from Russia, Norway and north Africa), has been identified by the European Commission as Natural Gas (NG) Route Number 3 {{in the framework of}} the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>energy</b> <b>networks</b> (TEN-E) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theory of}} <b>energy</b> <b>networks</b> in different <b>energy</b> forms is established following an in-depth {{analysis of the}} nature of energy for comprehensive energy utilization. The definition of an <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> is given. Combining the generalized balance equation of energy in space and the Pfaffian equation, the generalized transfer equations of energy in lines (pipes) are proposed. The energy variation laws in the transfer processes are investigated. To establish the equations of <b>energy</b> <b>networks,</b> the Kirchhoff's Law in electric networks is extended to <b>energy</b> <b>networks,</b> which is called the Generalized Kirchhoff"s Law. According to the linear phenomenological law, the generalized equivalent energy transfer equations with lumped parameters are derived in terms of the characteristic equations of energy transfer in lines(pipes). The equations are finally unified into a complete <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> equation system and its solvability is further discussed. Experiments are carried out on a combined cooling, heating and power(CCHP) system in engineering, the <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> theory proposed in this paper is used to model and analyze this system.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} Hannah Kruimer analyses {{the application}} of the legal principle of non-discrimination in the context of <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> operation. Since the early 1990 s the duty not to discriminate has applied to <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> operators, in order to achieve a liberalised European energy market, in which European consumers have a free and real choice of energy supplier. This book provides guidance to those working {{in the context of the}} non-discrimination obligation, such as <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> operators, regulatory authorities, national courts and other energy market players, as well as those studying the rules for (academic) research purposes. The book?s conclusions serve as a tool for critical consideration and offer suggestions for improvements to the legal framework and its application on a European as well as a national level. It is thus of practical as well as academic relevance. Several questions are answered in this book, including why <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> operators have a non-discrimination obligation in the context of energy market liberalisation, how European law has tried to remove and control the discrimination problem since the early 1990 s and when different treatment of <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> users amounts to ?forbidden? discrimination? The book?s conclusions are underpinned by legal comparisons with competition, public procurement and telecommunications, as well as a case-study on how <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> operators and regulators in several Member States currently interpret and apply the non-discrimination obligation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> with {{polygeneration}} {{system and}} CCS suitable for China was proposed {{in our previous}} work in consideration of low-cost CCS and energy providing safety. In this paper, based on life-cycle analysis, {{the role of the}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> has been investigated at the national level. Results show that with the import dependency of oil controlled in the range of 40 %– 60 % during 2020 to 2030, up to 22 % of the total capacity of coal fired supercritical power plants may be replaced by hundreds of new polygeneration plants for electricity and alternative fuels. When the oil import dependency will be kept from 40 % to 60 %, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> can save 20 %– 30 % of energy and cut down 30 %– 40 % of total costs every year compared to the present method with coal fired supercritical power plants and traditional alternative fuel plants with CO 2 capture. And the <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> can capture more than 0. 1 billion tons of CO 2 with high concentration over 98 % each year. Moreover, from the aspect of CCS, this <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> can realize as low as 15 $/t of total CCS cost due to the quite low energy penalties of CO 2 capture in the polygeneration systems and the combination of CO 2 sources and storage sites. The new <b>Energy</b> <b>Network</b> has realized the proper combination of energy utilization and CO 2 capture and storage according to the unique state of China. It is suitable for China and may {{play an important role in}} CCS in the future...|$|R

40|$|As energy {{issues are}} {{emerging}} around the world, {{a variety of}} smart home technologies aimed at realizing zero energy houses are being introduced. Energy storage system (ESS) for smart home energy independence is increasingly gaining interest. However, limitations exist in {{that most of them}} are controlled according to time schedules or used in conjunction with photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. In consideration of load usage patterns and PV generation of smart home, this study proposes an ESS control algorithm that uses constant <b>energy</b> of <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> while making maximum use of ESS. Constant energy means that the load consumes a certain amount of power under all conditions, which translates to low variability. The proposed algorithm makes a smart home a load of <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> with low uncertainty and complexity. The simulation results show that the optimal ESS operating target power not only makes the smart home use power constantly from the <b>energy</b> <b>network,</b> but also maximizes utilization of the ESS. In addition, since the smart home is a load that uses constant energy, it has the advantage of being able to operate an efficient <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> from the viewpoint of energy providers...|$|R
