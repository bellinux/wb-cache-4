25|$|Another {{effective}} and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study {{funded by the}} US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> circulation. In this process, called adsorption, arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lynching advocates such as Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter Francis White {{campaigned for}} presidential {{candidate}} Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. They {{hoped he would}} lend public support to their efforts against lynching. Senators Robert F. Wagner and Edward P. Costigan drafted the Costigan-Wagner bill in 1934 to require local authorities to protect prisoners from lynch mobs. Like the Dyer bill, it made lynching a Federal crime in order to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state administration.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{expansion}} was {{explored in}} 2009.

On March 30, the DFWP agreed {{to take over the}} leases for a year. The ANPA and Hamlett suggested that the additional lands be used to house a small group of buffalo, or to provide camp sites for visitors. But no action had been taken as of April 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{explicit}} {{shots in the}} final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis {{was used for the}} scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. [...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even want it in there.

2500|$|As {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for animal rights, Linda lent her support to many organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and Friends of the Earth. She was also a patron of the League Against Cruel Sports. She narrated a TV advertisement for PETA, in which she said: [...] "Have {{you ever seen a}} fish gasping for breath when you <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water?

2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E

2500|$|Representatives {{from the}} Palestinian Authority {{paid a visit}} to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in June 2013, {{following}} the second conference of recruits Christians IDF and national service and ordered him to fire Naddaf immediately, providing letters from a number of Arab MKs, including Haneen Zoabi, Muhammad Barakeh and Basel Ghattas. According to MK Ghattas: [...] "Patriarch should explain Nadaf that it's not his job. Please take off his cape and join the Likud or Yisrael Beiteinu. He wants to bring the Christian community to the status of the Druze community, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its national affiliation". In addition patriarch was sent letters on the matter from [...] leaders of the Arab sector councils.|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, Michelle Obama {{attracted}} criticism when {{during a}} campaign speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin she said, [...] "Let me tell you, {{for the first}} time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country. Not just because Barack is doing well, but I think people are hungry for change." [...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said. [...] "Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a little bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E
