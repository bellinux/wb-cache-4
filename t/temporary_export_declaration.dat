40|$|The {{application}} of program transformations and refactorings involves {{the risk of}} capturing variables, which may break the intended semantics of the transformed code. One way to resolve variable capture is by renaming of the involved identifiers. However, in a modular context, the renaming of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations</b> is undesirable (affecting a module’s clients), and the renaming of imported declarations is impos-sible (requiring changes to third-party modules). We present an algorithm name-fix that detects and elimi-nates variable capture modularly. We extend a previous non-modular version of name-fix in order to (i) minimize re-namings of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations,</b> (ii) propagate necessary renamings of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations</b> to clients, and (iii) avoid renamings of imported declarations altogether. Together with support for transitive name bindings and conflicting declara-tions, our extensions to name-fix enable the application to real-world languages that feature separate compilation. To demonstrate the applicability of name-fix, we use it to mod-ularly resolve variable capture for optimizations, refactorings, and desugarings of Lightweight Java...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper uses {{data from}} the U. S. Census Bureau Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) {{to examine the effects}} that a growth of low-valued {{transactions}} likely has on the quality of export estimates provided in the U. S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT- 990) series. These transactions, valued at less than $ 2, 500, do not legally require the filing of <b>export</b> <b>declarations.</b> As a result, they are often not captured in the administrative records data used to construct FT- 990 estimates. By comparing industry-level estimates created from the ASM to related FT- 990 estimates, this paper estimates that the undercounting of low-valued transactions in the FT- 990 export series increases by roughly $ 30 billion over the period of 1994 - 1997. It also finds that regression analysis provides little insight into the undercounting issue as results are primarily driven by industries whose contributions to total manufacturing exports are small.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{countries}} are adopting e-government to deliver greater operational efficiency, cost savings and transparency. The current wave of globalization and {{the integration of the}} world economy have intensified international trade volumes. Thus, the prospect of development through trade has driven some countries sub-Saharan Africa to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly electronic data interchange (EDI) to facilitate international trade. This paper applies Amartya Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) as a framework to examine the effect of an e-government initiative intended to modernise customs operational procedures and facilitate trade. E-trade facilitation has given individuals and businesses the opportunity to lodge import and <b>exports</b> <b>declarations</b> electronically with a single document, resulting in time and cost savings as declarations can be made electronically from any location and at any time. The paper makes a contribution by offering a useful example of the affordances of the CA for examining e-government initiatives particularly in developing countries focusing on what people can actually do with the opportunities provided by e-government, rather than using income-based measures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of export {{controls}} in Russia and Ukraine on wheat world market price transmission during the 2007 / 2008 global food crisis. Russia and Ukraine aimed to reduce wheat exports induced by extraordinarily high world market prices to secure sufficient wheat supply on the domestic markets.

Although instability increased on the world markets itself, we have shown that the increase in the market instability was particularly pronounced in Russia and Ukraine. Also, the export restrictions dampened price transmission to the farmers’ prices, which pushed the growers’ prices below their long-run equilibrium level. Thus, investment incentives in wheat production which could result from high world market prices were foregone.

40|$|Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (RUK) {{are major}} {{players on the}} {{international}} grain markets and their exports help to improve global grain availability and hence food security. However, {{during the last decade}} the availability of RUK grain exports was repeatedly diminished by harvest failures and further reduced by the introduction of export restrictions. By simulating a reoccurrence of the 2010 RUK harvest situation this paper assesses the impact of grain harvest failures and subsequent <b>temporary</b> <b>export</b> restrictions (bans, quotas, taxes) on national and international food security, specifically quantifying the effects on agricultural market prices and quantities. For the analysis AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model, has been employed. Simulation results highlight the importance of RUK’s grain production for world markets and global food security, indicating substantial price increases due to limited grain exports from RUK. Moreover, scenario results illustrate that <b>temporary</b> RUK <b>export</b> restrictions can considerably aggravate the situation on world grain markets, with particularly adverse effects for grain net importing countries. At the same time results show that for a country like Ukraine, i. e. a country usually exporting large shares of its total grains production, the introduction of export restrictions could potentially result in decreases of domestic consumer prices to a level even below a situation with normal weather conditions. The results put international trade policy into focus and underline the necessity of greater cooperation on the part of exporting countries in order to avoid importing countries being denied necessary grain supplies.
