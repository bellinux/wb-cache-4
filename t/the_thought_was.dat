2500|$|In 1951, Jones began {{attending}} {{gatherings of}} the Communist Party USA in Indianapolis. He became flustered with harassment he received during the McCarthy Hearings, particularly regarding an event he attended {{with his mother}} focusing on Paul Robeson, after which she was harassed by the FBI {{in front of her}} co-workers for attending. He also became frustrated with ostracism of open communists in the United States, especially during the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. This frustration, among other things, provoked a seminal moment for Jones in which he asked himself, [...] "How can I demonstrate my Marxism? <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was,</b> infiltrate the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{retainer}} sacrifices was [...] "to enable the wealthy noble {{to enjoy the}} same kind of life-style after death as [...] had during [...] lifetime. <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> that the next life without that kind of luxury and ease was unthinkable. They also wanted to maintain the same social status they had enjoyed on earth; a social hierarchy that was based upon being served by others. Pharaohs used retainer sacrifices to reinforce the power of the position of the pharaoh, by showing the control they had over their subjects. Pharaohs also used retainer sacrifices to help communicate the idea that the state was literally worth dying for.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the works}} {{recorded}} by Capitol Records, [...] "Incident in Jazz" [...] {{is probably the}} most compositionally unified of Graettinger's and shows his full capabilities as an orchestral writer in progressive jazz or as a Third stream music composer (the work was originally entitled [...] "Incident in Sound"). [...] This is part of the new [...] "Innovations" [...] orchestra that Stan Kenton had marshalled into the studio to record these groundbreaking sides. Kenton comments on the unprecedented conditions this orchestra operated under, [...] "The Capitol people were with me all the way. There were tremendous sums of money involved in recording this orchestra and selling the music that was of such an unusual nature. I remember hour upon hour in the studio while we were recording, and there was no thought of how much it would cost: <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> only to make the finest recordings that we knew how." [...] The largesse of Capitol Records and Kenton himself would only last (roughly) six months until a more conventional, financially solvent Kenton 'dance' orchestra would be reformed to cut sides with the popular Capitol artist Nat King Cole. Graettinger's [...] "House of Strings" [...] (Aug 24, 1950) is recorded on a split session with popular Les Baxter sides; the Kenton 'Innovations Orchestra' as a regular touring and studio unit had come and gone quickly due to financial failure.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the nurse}} moaned like a snow wind. [...] "Alas!" [...] said she, [...] "that this thing should be; but <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> gone into your marrow, {{nor is there}} any cure against <b>the</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>Be</b> it so, then, even as you will; though power is less than weakness, power shall you have; and though <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> colder than winter, yet shall you think it to an end." ...|$|R

50|$|To analyse {{whether a}} {{relative}} clause is restrictive or non-restrictive a simple test can be applied: If the basic meaning of <b>the</b> sentence (<b>the</b> <b>thought)</b> <b>is</b> not changed {{by removing the}} relative clause, the relative clause is not essential to <b>the</b> basic <b>thought</b> and <b>is</b> non-restrictive. But if the essential meaning of <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> disturbed, <b>the</b> relative clause is restrictive.|$|R

50|$|Frege (1919) {{argued that}} an {{indicative}} sentence {{in which we}} communicate or state something, contains both a thought and an assertion, it expresses <b>the</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sense of the sentence.|$|R
60|$|Could {{it be that}} he was {{behaving}} badly toward Claire? <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> unpleasant, but {{he could}} not get rid of it. He extracted Claire's photograph from his suit-case and gazed solemnly upon it.|$|E

50|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{have two}} essential components: audibility and alienation. While people who experience thought insertion do share {{the experience of}} alienation (they cannot recognize that <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> they <b>are</b> having are self-generated) with auditory hallucinations, they lack the sense of audibility (experiencing <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> as occurring outside of their mind or spoken to them). <b>The</b> person experiencing <b>thought</b> insertion recognizes that <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> being <b>thought</b> of inside their mind, but they fail to recognize they are the one thinking it.|$|R
