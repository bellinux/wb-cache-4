5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E

25|$|May Fourth radicalism, {{combined}} {{with changes in}} the education system, made possible {{the emergence of a}} large group of women writers. While there had been women writers in the late imperial period and the late Qing, they had been few in number. These writers generally tackled domestic issues, such as relations between the sexes, family, and friendship, but they were revolutionary in giving direct expression to female subjectivity. Ding Ling's story Miss Sophia's Diary exposes <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings of its female diarist in all their complexity.|$|E

Dutta, a student of Hindu College himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Aside from {{residing}} {{with his}} father as he strove to find his own voice and work out his philosophical ideas, Hazlitt also stayed over with his older brother John, who had studied under Joshua Reynolds and was following {{a career as a}} portrait painter. He also spent evenings with delight in London's theatrical world, an aesthetic experience that would prove, somewhat later, of seminal importance to his mature critical work. In large part, however, Hazlitt was then living a decidedly contemplative existence, one somewhat frustrated by his failure to express on paper <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings that were churning within him. It was at this juncture that Hazlitt met Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This encounter, a life-changing event, was subsequently to exercise a profound influence on his writing career that, in retrospect, Hazlitt regarded as greater than any other.|$|E
25|$|Although {{written in}} the 19th century, The Brothers Karamazov {{displays}} a number of modern elements. Dostoyevsky composed the book {{with a variety of}} literary techniques. Though privy to many of <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings of the protagonists, the narrator is a self-proclaimed writer; he discusses his own mannerisms and personal perceptions so often in the novel that he becomes a character. Through his descriptions, the narrator's voice merges imperceptibly into the tone of the people he is describing, often extending into the characters' most personal thoughts. There is no voice of authority in the story (see Mikhail Bakhtin's Problems of Dostoyevsky's Poetics for more on the relationship between Dostoyevsky and his characters). In addition to the principal narrator there are several sections narrated by other characters entirely, such as the story of the Grand Inquisitor and Zosima's confessions. This technique enhances the theme of truth, making many aspects of the tale completely subjective.|$|E
25|$|Betjeman became Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1972, {{the first}} Knight Bachelor to be {{appointed}} (the only other, Sir William Davenant, had been knighted after his appointment). This role, combined with his popularity as a television performer, ensured that his poetry reached an audience enormous {{by the standards of}} the time. Similarly to Tennyson, he appealed to a wide public and managed to voice <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> aspirations of many ordinary people while retaining the respect of many of his fellow poets. This is partly because of the apparently simple traditional metrical structures and rhymes he uses. In the early 1970s, he began a recording career of four albums on Charisma Records which included Betjeman's Banana Blush (1974) and Late Flowering Love (1974), where his poetry reading is set to music with overdubbing by leading musicians of the time. His recording catalogue extends to nine albums, four singles and two compilations.|$|E

25|$|Schizophrenic patients' {{deficit in}} theory of mind impairs their daily {{interactions}} with others. An {{example of a}} disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who must understand <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> behaviors {{of their children and}} react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts. Compared with healthy mothers, mothers with schizophrenia are found to be more remote, quiet, self-absorbed, insensitive, unresponsive, and to have fewer satisfying interactions with their children. They also tend to misinterpret their children's emotional cues, and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative. Activities such as role-playing and individual or group-based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective-taking and theory of mind. Although there is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental role dysfunction, future studies could strengthen the relationship by possibly establishing a causal role of theory of mind on parenting abilities.|$|E
25|$|Lucario is a canid-like Pokémon {{that is a}} bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws, {{while its}} chest and the {{exterior}} of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, thighs shaped like baggy shorts, and four small appendages {{on the back of}} its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur that is slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. Lucario has the ability to sense and manipulate , a form of energy emitted by all living things, and is able to understand human speech. As a result, Lucario can read <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, {{to the point that it}} can even see otherwise invisible foes. When properly trained, it can identify the feelings of others even if they are over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, a baby Pokémon that is also able to sense Aura. Compared to Lucario, Riolu is a pure Fighting-type Pokémon, rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon, and it cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} in Paris that Acharya's {{thoughts}} were first turned towards socialism. This {{was similar to the}} lines of thought that appeared in the Indian revolutionary circles in Europe, especially in France, at this time. He was introduced to the Socialist circle in Paris in 1910, and enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> ideas that he shared. It was also {{with the help of the}} Paris Socialist circle, notably Jean Longuet, that the Paris Indian Society- which included Acharya, Har Dayal, Madam Cama and other notable names- brought pressure on the French Government when Savarkar was rearrested at Marseilles after escaping from a ship that was deporting him to India. Acharya made the most of the available press freedom and the socialist platform to press for the re-extradition of his erstwhile leader to France and build French public opinion in support of such moves. Under public pressure at home, the French Government conceded to make such a request to Britain. The matter was ultimately settled in the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, which ruled in favour of Britain. Acharya became extensively involved in the socialist movement. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910, where Shyamji Krishna Varma and V.V.S. Iyer succeeded in having a resolution passed demanding Savarkar's release and his extradition to France. It also succeeded in bringing to the attention of the organisation the state of affairs in India.|$|E

500|$|Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois's second autobiography, was {{published}} in 1940. The title refers to Du Bois's hope that African Americans were passing {{out of the darkness}} of racism into an era of greater equality. The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise. Du Bois described the book as [...] "the autobiography of a concept of race elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> deeds which were mine Thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{science fiction}} novel {{is about the}} ultimate inadequacy of communication between humans and other species.

In loyalty to the novel's complex and slow-paced narrative, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, viewing most of western science fiction as shallow. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker (1979).|$|E
