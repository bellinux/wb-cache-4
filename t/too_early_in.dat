5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the season or not damaging enough to dedicate {{a significant portion of}} disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Erwin Panofsky {{established}} that Schöne's dating {{was at least}} twenty years <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> <b>In</b> his view, the girl's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid-1470s. He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c. 1470 portrait by Hans Memling, and her gown to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse of Bruges. Sterling, placing the work as c. 1465, remarks that the hennin in the Berlin panel is of a different type {{to that of the}} New York painting. The New York headdress is far more extended, and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after, and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil. Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus' earlier works. On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist's career.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

25|$|Energy {{investment}} by workers {{required to produce}} reproductives is considerable.

Workers must maintain food stores and defend the nest, and colonies whose work force diminishes <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the colony’s life cycle will suffer a greater overall total loss in reproductives.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the 2DS using one physical display divided to emulate two, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica believed that Nintendo had missed an opportunity to produce a full-screen gaming tablet using the 2DS's form factor; which would have enabled future games and apps to use the entire screen area (which he estimated to be around the 5-inch range used by phablets), still allow backwards compatibility with games designed for the folding 3DS and DS, and enhance the ability to port existing smartphone games to the platform. However, Orland also noted that introducing such a product could fragment Nintendo's portable gaming ecosystem for existing 3DS users—and that it was <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the 3DS's life for Nintendo to introduce a successor.|$|E

25|$|Green, swing {{promoting}} {{and humid}} conditions {{sums up the}} construction of English pitches but everything depends on weather e.g. in summer it may behave like Indian pitches <b>too.</b> <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> the season, most batsmen {{have to be on}} their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country's weather. Later in the summer, the pitches tend to get harder and lose their green. This makes the task easier for batsmen and only genuine fast bowlers like those bowling in range of (135–150km/h) and spinners can contain. Spinners prove less effective {{in the first half of}} the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The humid conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practice reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. Of all grounds, The Oval is the most dangerous as the ball reverse swings most there. Another reason for this is traditionally it hosts the last international test match of a touring side in a summer.|$|E
25|$|Throughout production, CBS {{executives}} {{objected to}} the violent nature of the episode. They asked Guggenheim to make it less violent, but Guggenheim refused when possible. The executives also {{expressed concern about the}} overall plot of the episode. They felt that it would be <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the series to show Charlie's emotional reaction to the violence. The executives expressed concern about Charlie's emotional state during a scene set in the Eppes family garage where Charlie recalled the violence. Heuton and Falacci agreed to remove the scene as they felt that the scene did not suit the plot. Citing the convention that the protagonist in a crime drama does not lose his or her gun, the network executives also felt that the loss of Don's gun was inappropriate for the series. Heuton and Falacci insisted on keeping it in the script, and series regular Rob Morrow also liked the idea of Don losing his gun. Heuton and Falacci assured the executives that Don would have an emotional reward {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{composed}} of two related parts. In the first, we present a dynamic programming procedure for finding optimal policies for a class of sequential search problems that includes the well-known “secretary problem. ” In the second, we propose a stochastic model of choice behavior for this class of problems and test the model with two extant data sets. We conclude that the previously reported bias for decision makers to terminate their search <b>too</b> <b>early</b> can, <b>in</b> part, be accounted for by a stochastic component of their search policies...|$|R

The publication noted that when its release widened to over 200 theatres the previous weekend its per-theatre average was so low that its distributor decided to cut its screens in the succeeding weeks. Based on answers from film experts and executives for Fox Searchlight, there were five factors to why the film commercially disappointed: its timing, airing <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the year when lighter summer fare is still popular; a novel that is particularly difficult to adapt; mixed reviews from critics; its depressing tone; and its lack of appeal to male viewers.

500|$|Cancellara's pedigree, 2011 successes, {{and status}} as {{defending}} champion {{made him a}} major favorite for the second monument race, the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara put in a seemingly decisive move {{from the head of}} the main field on the Leberg, the fourteenth cobbled climb on the day's parcours. He quickly opened up a time gap of over a minute, and the race seemed to be decided. He cracked on the Muur van Geraardsbergen, however, and was swept up by an elite leading group of favorites and contenders. He put in a second acceleration on the last climb, the Bosberg, and was followed by Sylvain Chavanel and Nick Nuyens. Having perhaps spent himself <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the race by attacking solo and not working with other riders to gain a large time gap, Cancellara could only manage third of the three. After the race, Cancellara blasted Nuyens and the other riders in the race, saying they only rode to keep him from winning. He referred to himself as a [...] "gladiator" [...] and said that the manner in which Nuyens won, staying in Cancellara's slipstream and then outsprinting him with the line in view, had no value in his eyes.|$|E
