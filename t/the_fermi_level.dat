5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E
25|$|Metals have non-zero {{density of}} states at <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.</b> Metals with free-electron-like band {{structures}} (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low {{density of states}} at <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition metals, wherein the flat d-bands lie close to <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like metals.|$|E
25|$|Oxides have {{particularly}} {{flat band}} structures {{and thus can}} exhibit large , if <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> intersects these bands. As most oxides are insulators, this is generally not the case. However, when oxides are metallic (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> lies within an unfilled, flat set of bands), oxides exhibit {{some of the largest}} electronic entropies of any material.|$|E
50|$|When two metals are {{electrically}} isolated from each other, an arbitrary potential difference may exist between them. However, when two different neutral metal surfaces are brought into electrical contact (even indirectly, say, {{through a long}} wire), electrons will flow from the metal with a higher <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> to <b>the</b> metal with <b>the</b> lower <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> until <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> both phases are equal.Once this has occurred, the metals are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other (the actual number of electrons that passes between the two phases is usually small).Just because <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> are equal, however, {{does not mean that}} the electric potentials are equal. The electric potential outside each material is controlled by its work function, and so dissimilar metals can show an electric potential difference even at equilibrium.|$|R

50|$|When {{there is}} no {{external}} voltage(bias) applied to a PN junction, <b>the</b> quasi <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> for electron and holes overlap with one another.

40|$|Abstract:- The maximum {{theoretical}} {{open circuit}} voltage of a solar cell is set by its builtin voltage. For amorphous silicon p-i-n cells, the position of <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> p-and n- contact regions are {{on the order of}} 0. 4 eV and 0. 2 eV from their respective band edges, limiting the built-in voltage to Eg- 0. 6 eV. We propose replacing the p- and n- regions by superlattices, in which <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> wide gap barrier regions are, on an absolute scale, closer to the valence band or conduction band edges of the low gap material (a-Si:H), than the values indicated above. In order for the p- and n-superlattices to yield a larger build-in voltage, the density of states in the doped wide band materials must be much greater at <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> than that of the undoped low band gap quantum wells. To accomplish this, the wide gap material must be heavily doped and have effective tails much wider than that of the undoped low band gap material. For the n-region superlattice the barrier must be in the conduction band, hence we propose a-Si 1 –xCx: H and a-Si:H: For the p-region superlattice the barrier must be in the valence band, and we propose a-Si 1 –yNy: H and a-Si:H...|$|R

25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by the position of <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect {{is to increase the}} gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure. This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the 'body effect'.|$|E
25|$|The N-V0 centers can be {{converted}} into N-V− by changing <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> position. This {{can be achieved by}} applying external voltage to a p-n junction made from doped diamond, e.g., in a Schottky diode.|$|E
25|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The thermoelectric effect relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as {{the driving force}} to establish a gradient in electrical potential {{is driven by the}} entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the thermoelectric literature, the term band structure engineering refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.</b> More specifically, thermoelectric {{materials are}} intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in high electronic entropies. Instead of engineering band filling, one may also engineer the shape of the band structure itself via introduction of nanostructures or quantum wells to the materials.|$|E

40|$|We present {{measurements}} on the Kondo effect {{in a small}} quantum dot connected strongly to one lead and weakly to the other. The conductance of the dot reveals an offset of the Kondo resonance at zero magnetic field. While the resonance persists in the negative bias regime, it is suppressed in the opposite direction.

25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> must be {{identical}} for both bands, {{this means that}} there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as Pauli paramagnetism.|$|E
25|$|The Fermi energy {{can only}} be defined for non-interacting fermions (where the {{potential}} energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> (the electrochemical potential of an electron) remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} of charge neutrality means that N/V must match {{the density of}} protons in the material.

50|$|In {{semiconductors}} and semimetals {{the position}} of µ relative to the band structure can usually be controlled to a significant degree by doping or gating. These controls do not change µ which is fixed by the electrodes, but rather they cause the entire band structure to shift up and down (sometimes also changing the band structure's shape).

25|$|Cold field {{electron}} emission (CFE) {{is the name}} given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level. (By contrast, in the Schottky emission regime, most electrons escape {{over the top of}} a field-reduced barrier, from states well above <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.)</b> Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} of transition temperature with the unit-cell volume had been {{believed to be}} evidence for the BCS mechanism of C60 solid superconductivity, because inter C60 separation {{can be related to}} an increase in the density of states on <b>the</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> N(εF). Therefore, there have been many efforts to increase the interfullerene separation, in particular, intercalating neutral molecules into the A3C60 lattice to increase the interfullerene spacing while the valence of C60 is kept unchanged. However, this ammoniation technique has revealed a new aspect of fullerene intercalation compounds: the Mott transition and the correlation between the orientation/orbital order of C60 molecules and the magnetic structure.|$|E
