40|$|The {{control of}} tissue {{homeostasis}} is extremely complex and many {{factors contribute to}} the growth and development of tumours. Although the immune system has been regarded as an essential intermediary between putative psychological factors and the development or restraint of malignant tumours, this review indicates that many other possible mechanisms also exist. Current aspects of <b>tumour</b> biology, <b>immunology</b> and hormonal control systems are reviewed, and detailed psychobiological mediating mechanisms are considered at each stage of tumour development. An approach to the future investigation of this difficult field is proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation phenomena are key issues in <b>immunology,</b> <b>tumour</b> growth and cell biology. We study the kinetics of cell {{growth in the}} immune system using mathematical models formulated in terms of ordinary and delay differential equations. We study how the suitability of the mathematical models depends {{on the nature of}} the cell growth data and the types of differential equations by minimizing an objective function to give a best-fit parameterized solution. We show that mathematical models that incorporate a time-lag in the cell division phase are more consistent with certain reported data. They also allow various cell proliferation characteristics to be estimated directly, such as the average cell-doubling time and the rate of commitment of cells to cell division. Specifically, we study the Interleukin- 2 -dependent cell division of phytohemagglutinin stimulated T-cells [...] the model of which can be considered to be a general model of cell growth. We also review the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBladder {{cancer is}} one of the most {{frequent}} tumours of the urinary tract and the treatment of this malignancy requires close co-operation between urologists and oncologists. The superficial disease is treated with good results with transurethral resections and local immunotherapy or chemotherapy. However, there is a considerable fraction of BCG-refractory tumours (30 %) and progression to muscle-invasive cancer. New approaches such as BCG combined with low-dose interferon or recombinant BCG strains are promising but need to be explored in prospective trials. Better understanding of the <b>tumour</b> biology and <b>immunology</b> will probably make it possible select patients with a high risk of progressive disease and to tailor further therapy options. The cornerstone of muscle invasive tumours treatment is radical cystectomy. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising option, especially in tumours invading deeply into the bladder wall or infiltrating the surrounding organs, but it require furthers confirmation of the results in phase III trials before introducing it as a standard treatment. However some leading centers have already implemented neoadjuvant chemotherapy in some selected groups of patients (eg. M. D. Anderson). Combined chemotherapy and modern 3 -D conformal radiotherapy enable us to preserve the organ and the function of the bladder (bladder conserving therapy) and they are intensively studied in current trials. In the near future molecular characterisation of individual tumours might help to choose a bladder conserving therapy or cystectomy adopted to a for particular patient. So far, four-drug regimen – MVAC has been widely used in metastatic and locally advanced disease. Recently, it was shown that a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) is equally effective but less toxic. New chemotherapies tested in clinical trials include gemcitabine, taxanes and new-class drugs interfering with signal transduction. Individualization of established and experimental treatment options based on molecular tumour characteristics, such as p 53 status will probably be the future of bladder cancer pharmacotherapy...|$|R

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that regulation of MHC antigen expression by viruses and oncogenes, leading to either immune evasion or autoimmunity, is widespread and important in disease.

40|$|AbstractTumours are {{immunogenic}} and {{are commonly}} infiltrated by anti-cancer effector cells. Why, then, {{are they not}} completely rejected by the host? Unfortunately, tumours are Darwinian paragons, winning the battle {{against the forces of}} natural immune selection. Some of the latter can even act as double-edged swords, actually being subverted to become pro-tumorigenic. Prevention or reversal of tumour escape from the immune response therefore offers the possibility of reconstituting effective anti-tumour immunity and remains the major challenge for 21 st century <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology...</b>|$|E

40|$|Active {{specific}} immunotherapy holds {{great potential}} {{in the search for}} new therapeutic approaches for patients with cancer. Much preclinical and clinical evidence has shown that the immune system can be polarised against malignant cells by several vaccination strategies. Although no anticancer vaccine can be recommended outside clinical trials at present, tumour response and immunological findings in animals and humans should prompt researchers to investigate further the potential of this biotherapy. We summarise strategies for cancer vaccines so far implemented in the clinical setting, report the results of more than 200 clinical trials published over the past two decades, and discuss insights into preclinical <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> that might aid the design of the next generation of cancer vaccines...|$|E
40|$|An 'alien' MHC antigen {{has been}} {{previously}} described in the AKR tumour K 36. 16. We have attempted to establish {{the nature of this}} antigen by immunochemical techniques. Sequential immunoprecipitation and affinity purification of the 'alien' and regular antigens show that the same molecular entity is involved, the H- 2 Kd molecule being precipitated by anti H- 2 Dd sera. Absorption of the sera used to define this 'alien' antigen suggests that an interaction between endogenous viral antigens and H- 2 is responsible. Genetic rearrangement within the MHC may well be a facet of <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> but the AKR tumour K 36. 16 {{does not appear to be}} a suitable example for further study...|$|E
40|$|Lambert-Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) is a neuromuscular {{autoimmune disease}} that {{has served as}} a model for autoimmunity and <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology.</b> In LEMS, the characteristic muscle weakness is thought to be caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) present on the presynaptic nerve terminal. Half of patients with LEMS have an associated tumour, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which also expresses functional VGCC. Knowledge of this association led to the discovery {{of a wide range of}} paraneoplastic and non-tumour-related neurological disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems.

40|$|This review set out {{to answer}} several {{questions}} related to <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> and the gut. It is evident that in patients with gastrointestinal cancer {{there is a general}} depression of the immune response and this seems to be correlated with the stage of the disease. Paradoxically a specific immune response against definable tumour antigens can be demonstrated, both cellular and humoral mechanisms being involved although the complexities of this paradox require further analysis. Immunotherapy has been employed in gastrointestinal tumours in a sporadic way. The results suggest that gastrointestinal neoplasms may respond at least as well as other tumours. A firm conclusion awaits the results of controlled trials in which the bulk of the tumour has been effectively dealt with by other means or where combined immunochemotherapy is being used...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Attempts {{were made}} to induce {{immunity}} to 5 spontaneous rat sarcomas transplanted into syngeneic recipients. Rats were immunized by surgical removal of growing tumour transplants or by treatment with attenuated tumour, followed by challenge with tumour cells in suspension. Two tumours were apparently not immunogenic, but {{a low level of}} immunity was induced against 2, and weak evidence of immunity was observed with another. Induced immunity was individually specific rather than cross-reactive. It is concluded that, contrary to some reports, some spontaneous animal tumours are immunogenic in the strain of origin.

40|$|A {{proportion}} of peritoneal leukocytes from CBA mice adhered to glass haemacytometer surfaces and withstood a gentle washing. This proportion was reduced with cells taken from mice sensitized to a methylcholanthrene‐induced tumour, when the specific tumour antigen was {{added in the}} form of a soluble extract. The reaction of leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI) may have an immunological basis similar to that of macrophage migration inhibition, but LAI is a much simpler procedure. Leukocytes were active in LAI when taken from animals bearing tumours and after tumour removal. When serum from mice bearing a particular tumour was added to sensitized leukocytes in the presence of the specific tumour antigen, the inhibition of adherence was substantially relieved or blocked. LAI could thus be used to demonstrate both cellmediated immunity to tumours and blocking factors in serum by a brief, simple procedure. A potential application to human <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> is indicated. Copyrigh...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a rapid {{expansion}} in the field of <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology.</b> There is now convincing evidence that both the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system are capable of interacting with tumour cells. The most significant advances have been in our understanding of cellular responses and the complex events that lead to T-lymphocyte activation, {{as well as in the}} identification of tumour antigens recognised by T-lymphocytes. This knowledge has led to the development of anticancer immunotherapies designed to produce tumour antigenspecific T-cell responses, adding to the earlier antibody or whole-cell vaccine approaches. In addition, new methods have been developed to quantify antigenspecific T-cell responses, and the emergent field of recombinant gene technology has led to an increasing number of novel methods for vaccine delivery. This review will explore these advances, as well as possible future directions, with an emphasis on colorectal cancer. Anti-tumour immune responses Correspondence to...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> remains the identification of strongly immunogenic tumour antigens for vaccination. Reverse immunology, that is, the procedure to predict and identify immunogenic peptides from the {{sequence of a gene}} product of interest, has been postulated to be a particularly efficient, high-throughput approach for tumour antigen discovery. Over one decade after this concept was born, we discuss the reverse immunology approach in terms of costs and efficacy: data mining with bioinformatic algorithms, molecular methods to identify tumour-specific transcripts, prediction and determination of proteasomal cleavage sites, peptide-binding prediction to HLA molecules and experimental validation, assessment of the in vitro and in vivo immunogenic potential of selected peptide antigens, isolation of specific cytolytic T lymphocyte clones and final validation in functional assays of tumour cell recognition. We conclude that the overall low sensitivity and yield of every prediction step often requires a compensatory up-scaling of the initial number of candidate sequences to be screened, rendering reverse immunology an unexpectedly complex approach...|$|E
40|$|Immune {{checkpoint}} inhibitors (ICIs) targeting Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA- 4) or Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD- 1) receptors {{have demonstrated}} remarkable efficacy in subsets {{of patients with}} malignant disease. This emerging treatment modality holds great promise for future cancer treatment and has engaged pharmaceutical research interests in <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology.</b> While ICIs can induce rapid and durable responses in some patients, identifying predictive factors for effective clinical responses has proven challenging. This review summarises the mechanisms of action of ICIs and outlines important pre-clinical work that contributed to their development. We explore clinical data {{that has led to}} disease-specific drug licensing, and highlight key clinical trials that have revealed ICI efficacy across a range of malignancies. We describe how ICIs have been used as part of combination therapies, and explore their future prospects in this area.

40|$|Surgical {{resection}} of {{a primary}} tumour is often not sufficient to cure a patient. Even when no residual cancer can be detected at time of surgery, metastases may appear in the following years, which indicates that the primary tumour had apparently spread before surgery. Following surgery, systemic chemotherapy {{may be used to}} eradicate micro-metastatic disease. Here we present two unconventional strategies that implement new insights into tumour biology and <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> in the treatment of patients with cancer. Both experimental strategies use the individual characteristics of the patient's primary tumour to optimise the control of life-threatening micro-metastases. We aim to modulate the patient's adaptive immune system, targeting it towards the patient's own tumour cells to eradicate residual disease following local treatment. In one approach, this is done by autologous tumour cell vaccinations as adjuvant treatment for colon cancer patients and, in a second approach, by giving chemo-immunotherapy before local treatment to women with locally advanced breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) for {{the generation}} of anti-tumour immunity {{has been the focus}} of a vast array of scientific and clinical studies. The ability of DCs to present protein tumour antigens (T-Ags) to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells is pivotal to the success of therapeutic cancer vaccines. DC's specialised capacity to cross-present exogenous Ags onto major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules for {{the generation of}} T-Ag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has made these cells the focal point of vaccine-based immunotherapy of cancer. However, although DC-based strategies can induce T cell responses in cancer patients, recent reviews of clinical studies demonstrate that DC-based approaches have essentially failed to meet their clinical end points. These findings highlight the need to re-evaluate the DC-based vaccine strategies and incorporate recent advancements in DC biology and <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology.</b> The current review considers the issues related to how best to target the Ag-processing pathway of DCs, the role of adjuvants, the appropriate conditioning of the DCs and strategies to overcome tumour-mediated immune escape...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years {{significant}} advances {{have been made in the}} fields of gene therapy and <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology,</b> such that there now exists a considerable body of evidence validating the proof in the principle of gene therapy based cancer vaccines. While clinical benefit has so far been marginal, data from preclinical and early clinical trials of gene therapy combined with standard therapies are strongly suggestive of additional benefit. Many reasons have been proposed to explain the paucity of clinical responses to single agent vaccination strategies including the poor antigenicity of tumour cells and the development of tolerance through down-regulation of MHC, costimulatory, signal transduction, and other molecules essential for the generation of strong immune responses. In addition, there is now evidence from animal models that the growing tumour may actively inhibit the host immune response. Removal of the primary tumour prior to T cell transfer from the spleen of cancer bearing animals, led to effective tumour cell line specific immunity in the recipient mouse suggesting that there is an ongoing tumour-host interaction. This model also illustrates the potential difficulties of clinical vaccine trials in patients with advanced stage disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite mankind's many achievements, we {{are yet to}} find a {{cure for}} cancer. We are now {{approaching}} a new era which recognises the promise of harnessing the immune system for anti-cancer therapy. Pathogens have been implicated for decades as potential anti-cancer agents, but implementation into clinical therapy has been plagued with significant drawbacks. Newer 'designer' agents have addressed some of these concerns, in particular, a new breed of oncolytic virus: JX- 594, a genetically engineered pox virus, is showing promise. Objective: To review the current literature on the use of oncolytic viruses in the treatment of cancer; both by direct oncolysis and stimulation of the immune system. The review will provide a background and historical progression for the surgeon on <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology,</b> and the interplay between oncolytic viruses, immune cells, inflammation on tumourigenesis. Methods: A literature review was performed using the Medline database. Conclusions: Viral therapeutics hold promise as a novel treatment modality for the treatment of disseminated malignancy. It provides a multi-pronged attack against tumour burden; direct tumour cell lysis, exposure of tumour-associated antigens (TAA), induction of immune danger signals, and recognition by immune effector cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Genes {{expressed}} both {{in normal}} testis and in malignancies (Cancer/ Testis associated genes – CTA) {{have become the}} most extensively studied antigen group {{in the field of}} <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology.</b> Despite this, many fundamentally important questions remain unanswered: what is the connection between germ-cell specific genes and tumours? Is the expression of these genes yet another proof for the importance of genome destabilisation in the process of tumorigenesis?, or maybe activation of these genes is not quite random but instead related to some programme giving tumours a survival advantage? This review collates most of the recent information available about CTAs expression, function, and regulation. The data suggests a programme related to ontogenesis, mostly to gametogenesis. In the "brain-storming" part, facts in conflict with the hypothesis of random CTA gene activation are discussed. We propose a programme borrowed from organisms phylogenetically much older than humans, which existed before the differentiation of sexes. It is a programme that has served as a life cycle with prominent ploidy changes, and from which, as we know, the germ-cell ploidy cycle – meiosis – has evolved. Further work may show whether this hypothesis can lead to a novel anti-tumour strategy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> there is no therapy of proven survival benefit for advanced melanoma. Nevertheless, disease progression is slow in a small proportion of patients with metastatic melanoma, suggesting a contribution to outcome from host factors. Recent data have indicated the importance of the heat shock protein receptor CD 91 in immune responses to, and progression of, infectious disease. Here we investigate the relationship between CD 91 expression and outcome in malignancy. Rare melanoma patients were recruited with advanced disease that was progressing unusually slowly. CD 91 expression on their monocytes was compared with control patients with more typical rapidly advancing metastatic disease. Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines, as well as innate and adaptive immune subsets, were also measured in the two groups. A significant increase in median CD 91 expression levels was observed in slow progressors (P = 0 · 006). There were no differences in other immune subset markers or inflammatory cytokines. The ability of CD 91 to internalize and cross-present tumour antigens through the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway may maintain CD 8 -positive cytotoxic T cell responses and contribute to slow progression of advanced melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Immune {{responses}} {{influence the}} development and progression of amalignancy. The tumourcan alsomanipulate the immune systemtoitsown ends,oftenresulting in an ineffective or transient antitumour response. An appreciation {{of the complexity of}} these host-tumour interactions is therefore important for the development of more-effective cancer therapies. This article highlights some prominent mechanisms whereby tumours escape recognition and destruction by the host immune system, thus facilitating disease progression. One important consequence of tumour escape is that an antitumour immune response may unintentionally lead to the outgrowth of less immunogenic or more apoptosisresistant tumour escape variants, which possess enhanced tumourigenic potential. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer evasion and the complexity of the ever-changing interactions between host and tumour will enable a more rational design of antitumour therapies and may help not only explain disease recurrence, but also identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions. This article also offers a brief review of preclinical animal models, which are essential tools in the study of <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> and cancer biology, particularly those that recapitulate the chronic nature of host-tumour interactions and help guide {{the development and}} testing of new therapies.

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{therapeutic}} approaches to haematological malignant disease involves exploitation of the antitumour potential of adaptive immunity-the most specific killing system against cancer currently known. Here, we summarise immunological strategies behind active specific immunotherapy, and describe the clinical and immunological results from trials published to date. Available data in humans {{support the hypothesis that}} various vaccination regimens can polarise adaptive immunity towards effective control of cancer-cell growth. However, the exploratory nature of clinical studies done thus far does not allow any cancer vaccine to be used as standard treatment for haematological malignant disorders. Because the cause of disease recurrence is the presence of minimal residual disease after conventional treatments, the adjuvant setting might be the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for active specific immunotherapy, when the immunosuppressive effects of bulky disease are virtually absent and when the effector-target ratio is favourable. In the near future, completion of randomised phase III trials as well as clinical implementation of the most recent insights into <b>tumour</b> <b>immunology</b> that aim to overcome immune tolerance towards malignant cells should allow investigators to define the actual role of vaccines in the management of haematological tumours...|$|E
