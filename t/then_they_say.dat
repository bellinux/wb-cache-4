2500|$|Prior to the accident, CMSE {{had ignored}} {{warnings}} over unsafe working conditions in its mines. According to Javier Castillo, {{secretary of the}} trade union that represents San José's miners, the company's management operates [...] "without listening {{to the voice of}} the workers when they say that there is danger or risk". [...] "Nobody listens to us. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> we're right. If they would have believed the workers, we would not be lamenting this now", said Gerardo Núñez, head of the union at a nearby Candelaria Norte mine.|$|E

They say we gamble too much.” The way these lines are written reflect their meaning and {{make you feel like}} you’re being told: “they blame… they say… they say… etc.” This idea of {{shifting}} the blame for what happened to the Indians on the Indians is common and despicable. It reflects the idea of the colonizers giving (“gifting”) land to the Indians as though they weren’t theirs in the first place. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that the Indians are so privileged, but what privileges do they have when they are constantly pre-judged for things like drinking and gambling? ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the next}} nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko {{returned}} to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other. [...] Largo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fiancé. [...] Kimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on Sight, which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom. [...] Ping {{is concerned about the}} whereabouts of Miho, who hasn't been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance. [...] Ping and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho. [...] Yuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this. [...] That night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and Endgames, which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there. [...] This leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her. [...] Kimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for Sight and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> goodnight and leave. [...] He returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning. [...] Once at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko. [...] During all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho. [...] His current location is unknown.|$|E

[...] So it must have originally belonged to Mr. Jones' father; and I wondered whether he had ever read it; or, indeed, whether any body had ever read it, even the author himself; but <b>then</b> authors, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> never read their own books; writing them, being enough in all conscience.|$|R

5000|$|Object {{transference}} was {{the most}} frequently used of their special powers. This ability enabled the brothers to instantaneously teleport any inanimate object across the room.
