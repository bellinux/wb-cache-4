5|$|In 1951, {{his novel}} The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> was an {{immediate}} popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially among adolescent readers.

50|$|<b>The</b> River <b>Rye</b> or Ryewater (Abhainn na Rí) is a {{tributary}} of the River Liffey. It rises in County Kildare, flowing south-east for 12 miles. Although the river has been drained it is generally fast flowing over a stoney bottom. <b>The</b> <b>Rye's</b> major tributary is the Lyreen.|$|R

Further changes to shops were made in 2015, with the closure of Wimbledon and Birmingham New Street, the opening of <b>The</b> <b>Rye</b> Bookshop {{and a return to}} Welwyn Garden City. The company reported an operating income of £5.4 million and a further narrowing of losses to £4.5 million from £18.8 million the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The novel The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> by J. D. Salinger plays a {{major part}} in the episode, as the South Park boys are {{inspired}} to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does {{not live up to}} its controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> House Plot of 1683, {{an attempt}} to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and {{gathered}} supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E
50|$|Understanding {{wild plant}} species is {{becoming}} {{important in the}} development of new crops. <b>The</b> wild perennial <b>rye</b> (Secale montanum) is the ancestor of <b>the</b> cultivated <b>rye</b> (Secale cereale). Many forms of perennial rye are found in Turkey including Secale monatum Guss var. anatolicum Boiss and Secale montanum Guss var. vavilovi Grossh. These perennial species usually have large stature, high frost resistance, strong tillering ability, and tolerance to poor soils and drought. Faults of <b>the</b> <b>ryes</b> that need to be overcome include small and sparse leaves and breaking peduncles.|$|R

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye,</b> {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Department of National Heritage {{bought the}} castle from its owners. The {{government}} agency English Heritage {{took control of}} the castle in 1984 and a scheme to reopen the property to visitors was put forward in 1993. This included a final assessment of the archaeological work of the previous decades, and the castle finally opened to the public again in 1994. As of 2015, the castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye.</b> In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E

5|$|Plans were {{discussed}} for several different actions {{to overthrow the}} monarch, following the failure of <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> House Plot to assassinate Charles II and James, in 1683, while Monmouth was in self-imposed exile in the Dutch Republic. The Monmouth rebellion was coordinated with a rebellion in Scotland, where Archibald Campbell, the Earl of Argyll, landed with a small force. The Duke of Monmouth had been popular in the South West of England, so he planned to recruit troops locally and {{take control of the}} area before marching on London.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouth {{rebellion}} {{was planned}} in Holland and coordinated with another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, the Earl of Argyll. Several areas of England were considered as potential locations for rebellion, including Cheshire and Lancashire {{along with the}} South West, as these were seen as having {{the highest number of}} opponents of the monarchy. Argyll and Monmouth both began their expeditions from Holland, where James's nephew and son-in-law, stadtholder William III of Orange, had not detained them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts. Argyll sailed to Scotland and, on arriving there, raised recruits mainly from his own clan, the Campbells, as part of the Scottish revolt. He had previously been involved in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> House Plot of 1683.|$|E
5|$|Anthony {{passed on}} both the castle and a {{considerable}} fortune to his son, yet another Sir Edward Hungerford, in 1657. After his marriage, Edward enjoyed an income of around £8,000 (£1,110,000) a year, making him a very wealthy man. Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed to the throne on Charles's death, and after the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might {{be used in a}} possible revolt.|$|E

5|$|Charles's {{opposition}} to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> House Plot, a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced {{him to leave the}} races early, thus, inadvertently, avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked. Protestant politicians such as Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Algernon Sydney, Lord William Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Lord Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court. Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.|$|E
5|$|The river {{has been}} managed {{by a number}} of bodies, {{including}} the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> Harbour Commissioners, and the Board of Conservators for the River Rother. After the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, it was managed by the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board, the Kent River Board, the Kent and Sussex River Authorities, the National Rivers Authority and finally the Environment Agency. It is unusual, in that while it is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Environment Agency, it has been a free river since 1826, and so no licence is required to use it. Management of the levels adjacent to the river is undertaken by the Romney Marshes Area Internal Drainage Board. The Rother passes by or near the villages of Etchingham, Robertsbridge, Bodiam, Northiam, and Wittersham.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While the board had overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as Internal Drainage Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

50|$|Because some {{municipalities}} {{have the}} same name, it is often necessary to indicate whether one is referring to the city, town, village, or hamlet. For example, <b>the</b> town of <b>Rye</b> is completely separate from <b>the</b> city of <b>Rye.</b> Pelham is <b>the</b> name of a town and also of a village in the town. The village of Mamaroneck is located partially {{in the town of}} Mamaroneck and partially in <b>the</b> town of <b>Rye,</b> but {{has nothing to do with}} <b>the</b> city of <b>Rye.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> has had {{significant}} cultural influence, and works {{inspired by the}} novel have been said to form their own genre. Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> to include the novels Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, Ordinary People by Judith Guest, and the film Igby Goes Down by Burr Steers.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{influence}} on the play is the novel The Catcher in <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on The Catcher in <b>The</b> <b>Rye</b> to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.|$|E
