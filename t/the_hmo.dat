25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from <b>the</b> <b>HMO,</b> except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem {{for people who want to}} use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve this dilemma, because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan will pay for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E

Generally the physicians are compensated either via fee for service (FFS) or capitated arrangements. This paper investigates whether the means by which the physicians are compensated influences the quality of care received by enrollees. Using data for all Medicaid HMO enrollees in a large state, we find that enrollees in HMOs that pay their Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) exclusively via FFS arrangements are more likely to receive services for which <b>the</b> <b>HMO’s</b> PCPs receive additional compensation. Further, these enrollees are less likely to receive services for which <b>the</b> <b>HMO’s</b> PCPs do not receive additional compensation.

2500|$|They are {{licensed}} at {{the state}} level, under a license that {{is known as a}} certificate of authority (COA), rather than under an insurance license. In 1972, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted <b>the</b> <b>HMO</b> Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operations. In practice, an HMO is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and the delivery of health care for enrollees. In the design of the plan, each member is assigned a [...] "gatekeeper", a primary care physician (PCP) responsible for the overall care of members assigned. Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also require specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by <b>the</b> <b>HMO</b> unless it defines the situation to be an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Just as {{the more}} loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs {{themselves}} have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were [...] "staff-model" [...] HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors {{and other health care}} professionals who staffed them. The name health maintenance organization stems from the idea that <b>the</b> <b>HMO</b> would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, <b>the</b> <b>HMO</b> can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.|$|E

40|$|Background: The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), {{operated}} majorly in Nigeria {{by health}} maintenance organisations (HMOs), took off formally in June 2005. In {{view of the}} inherent risks {{in the operation of}} any social health insurance, it is necessary to efficiently manage these risks for sustainability of the scheme. Consequently the risk-management strategies deployed by HMOs need regular assessment. This study assessed the risk management in the Nigeria social health insurance scheme among HMOs. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 33 <b>HMOs</b> participating in <b>the</b> NHIS. Results: Utilisation of standard risk-management strategies by <b>the</b> <b>HMOs</b> was 11 (52. 6 %). The other risk-management strategies not utilised in the NHIS 10 (47. 4 %) were risk equalisation and reinsurance. As high as 11 (52. 4 %) of participating HMOs had a weak enrollee base (less than 30, 000 and poor monthly premium and these impacted negatively on <b>the</b> <b>HMOs</b> such that a large percentage 12 (54. 1 %) were unable to meet up with their financial obligations. Most of <b>the</b> <b>HMOs</b> 15 (71. 4 %) participated in the Millennium development goal (MDG) maternal and child health insurance programme. Conclusions: Weak enrollee base and poor monthly premium predisposed <b>the</b> <b>HMOs</b> to financial risk which impacted negatively on the overall performance in service delivery in the NHIS, further worsened by the non-utilisation of risk equalisation and reinsurance as risk-management strategies in the NHIS. There is need to make the scheme compulsory and introduce risk equalisation and reinsurance...|$|R

The MS spectrum is shown in Figure S 9 in which less HMOs' characteristic peaks were detected, the peaks were ascribed to Lactose (2 [Hex]), [Hex][NeuAc], 2 [Hex][Fuc], 3 [Hex][HexNAc][Fuc], and 3 [Hex][HexNAc] 2 [Fuc], and <b>the</b> other <b>HMOs</b> in low abundance cannot be detected efficiently. When we further reduced the human milk concentration to 0.01 μL (Figure S 10), just the lactose (m/z 381.1) and [Hex][NeuAc] (m/z 453.1) characteristic peaks were detected, and the MS signal appeared in a very low intensity.
