50|$|Some TMGs are {{equipped}} with folding wings {{to allow them to}} fit in standard small airplane T-hangars. <b>Tow</b> <b>hooks</b> are unnecessary, since aircraft with self-launch ability do not require access to winch or tow plane for launching like a conventional glider.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} body {{consisted of}} a frame built up with 25 mm thick steel plates. On this frame the body was mounted with a cab at each end. The <b>towing</b> <b>hook</b> and the buffers were fixed to an abutment beam which was mounted to the frame.|$|E

They have air-conditioned accommodation for a crew of 5 officers and 29 enlisted sailors.|$|E
50|$|See Figure 2 for an {{illustration}} of error influences in a practical bollard pull trial. Note the difference in elevation of {{the ends of the}} line (the port bollard is higher than the ship's <b>towing</b> <b>hook).</b> Furthermore, there is the partial short circuit in propeller discharge current, the uneven trim of the ship and the short length of the tow line. All of these factors contribute to measurement error.|$|E
50|$|A recent Dutch {{innovation}} is the Carousel Tug, {{winner of the}} Maritime Innovation Award at the Dutch Maritime Innovation Awards Gala in 2006. The Carousel Tug adds a pair of interlocking rings {{to the body of}} the tug, the inner ring attached to the boat, with the outer ring attached to the towed ship by winch or <b>towing</b> <b>hook.</b> Since the towing point rotates freely, the tug is very difficult to capsize.|$|E

40|$|Requirements for the {{creation}} of a new technological process of manufacturing of <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> were cost savings by optimizing the initial blank and by creating semi automatic workplace. Selecting longitudinal rolling technology for manufacturing preform piece occurs to shorten production times and substantial material savings. By rolling of blank are secured always the exact dimensions of the preform piece and through a chain conveyors is facilitated handling with material for workers and reduced production time of forging line. By introduction of the proposed manufacturing method of <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> depending on the size of the series 30000 hooks per year will be achieved annually savings of over 4. 000. 000 CZK. Return of investments for the acquisition and adjustment of forging rolls and conveyors is 2, 2 years...|$|R
5000|$|The 1991 {{facelift}} included revised grill, headlights, turn signals, badges, and hubcaps - {{as well as}} {{reduction of}} <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> to two from four.

50|$|Service use {{primarily}} {{revolved around}} (Pilot) Advanced Flying Units, while several hundred Miles Master IIs were converted, or delivered new, for the glider-towing role, {{with the bottom}} of the rudder cut away to allow fitting of a <b>towing</b> <b>hook.</b> Miles Masters were extensively used from 1942 as tugs for General Aircraft Hotspur gliders at Glider Training Schools. Examples were also operated by the RAFs Anti-aircraft Co-operation units for liaison with army units.|$|E
50|$|Constructed {{almost entirely}} from Galssfibre using epoxy resin, the SZD-49 had a welded steel tube centre section truss {{to accept the}} loads from the wings, {{undercarriage}} and <b>towing</b> <b>hook.</b> A one piece forward opening canopy with integral glare-shield gave access to the cockpit for entry/egress and maintenance. The wings are fitted with full span flaps with drooping ailerons as well as single leaf airbrakes extending from {{top and bottom surfaces}} of the wing. Ailerons are driven through a patented linkage entirely enclosed inside the wing.|$|E
5000|$|The first conversion, test {{registration}} G-25-9, flew on 5 July 1960 and {{was produced}} by Air Tows Ltd at Lasham and was fitted with an electrically-driven winch but the next was converted by Auster at Rearsby with a conventional Auster-designed <b>towing</b> <b>hook.</b> [...] Other conversions were carried out {{by a number of}} organisations including one by British European Airways employees at London Heathrow Airport for their own gliding club. Some surplus Royal Canadian Air Force Auster AOP.6 aircraft were also converted in Canada for glider towing.|$|E
50|$|The NM-3 was {{the last}} model to have an {{enclosed}} cab. It {{was similar to the}} NM-1 and NM-2 except for:front pintle for positioning artillery pieces, arched bumper (front pintle under the arche), smaller brush guard, side lights on mudguards, <b>towing</b> <b>hooks</b> on bumper deleted, radiator shell with Mack nameplate.|$|R
50|$|The glider was {{designed}} to fly at low airspeeds. It could maintain flight at 20 mph with a 15 to 1 glide ratio. The fuselage is made of welded steel tubing. The wings use spruce spars, are wire supported and fabric covered. A releasable <b>tow</b> <b>hook</b> was mounted on the front.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 Dawydoff {{obtained}} the plans {{and the rights}} to produce the Slingsby Cadet under licence from Fred Slingsby. Dawydoff had the plans redrawn to US measurements, the structural strength increased, plus a new <b>tow</b> <b>hook</b> and wing rigging design. The wing is assembled using just one 4 ft long pin per wing.|$|R
