40|$|The problem studied {{was whether}} {{supervisors}} evaluated <b>telecommuters</b> differently than their on-site co-workers and, if they did, was this difference explainable by the models on performance ratings by Landy and Farr (1980, 1983, 1989) ? For this study, telecommuting referred to {{employees who are}} full-time employees, but work off-site using electronic communication devices and telecommuted {{at least one day}} per week. Twenty organizations nation-wide were surveyed. Hypotheses stated that {{there was no difference in}} supervisory performance appraisal criteria, supervisory performance ratings whether the supervisor selected employees to telecommute or the supervisor telecommuted or not, and the frequency between formal performance appraisals for <b>telecommuters</b> and non-telecommuters. Performance appraisal criteria and other questions concerning the evaluation process were analyzed. The data supported the first hypothesis of no difference in performance appraisal criteria used to evaluate <b>telecommuters</b> and non-telecommuters. The second hypothesis was not supported by the data. The three groups disagreed that <b>telecommuters</b> were generally better performers than their on-site co-workers. Supervisors and <b>telecommuters</b> disagreed on their perceptions of <b>telecommuters</b> as rated as better employees. It was assumed in the third hypothesis that supervisors who themselves telecommuted would not rate <b>telecommuters</b> as better employees than their co-workers. Due to the small sample size, the results were inconclusive. In the fourth hypothesis, it was assumed that supervisors who had the final say about who would be eligible to telecommute would not perceive <b>telecommuters</b> as better employees. Based on the analysis, the hypothesis could not be supported or refuted due to the small sample size. Finally, the fifth hypothesis relied on measuring the number of months between formal reviews to determine if <b>telecommuters</b> were evaluated more frequently than their onsi te co-workers. The analysis verified that there was no difference between the two groups. Because no prior research has been conducted about differences in evaluating telecommuting and nontelecommuting employees, there is no data available for comparison purposes to discover any trends or changes. Future research on this subject should include a review of actual performance appraisal records to determine if differences in ratings for <b>telecommuters</b> and nontelecommuters exists...|$|R

While {{he was not a}} <b>telecommuter,</b> this incident brought attention to the risks inherent in working off-site. Ninety percent of executives charged with security in large organizations feel that telework is not a security concern. They are more concerned with the occasional work that's taken out of the office by non-teleworkers because they lack the training, tools, and technologies that teleworkers receive. In other studies regarding Job Characteristics Theory, job feedback seemed to have the strongest relationship with overall job satisfaction compared to other job characteristics. While teleworking, communication is not as immediate or rich as face-to-face interactions. Less feedback when teleworking is associated with lower job engagement. Thus, when perceived supervisor support and relationship quality between leaders and teleworkers decreases, job satisfaction of the teleworker decreases. [...] The importance of manager communication with teleworkers is made clear in a study that found that individuals have lower job satisfaction when their managers telework.|$|E
50|$|According to {{an article}} from New York Times, {{telecommuting}} now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency. The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked {{to be back in}} the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers’ flexibility. America has an increasing trend of using teleworking due to its strong economics and multimedia services. Among the top 10 <b>telecommuter</b> countries, U.S is ranked number one; however, developing countries like China is also catching up to the trend.An article from money.163.com states that the number of telecommuters in the Asia pacific region exceeds region like America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific region has about 37% telecommuters while the others have about 23-4%. Chinese citizens also favor the combination of telecommuting and office work due to reason like disturbance at work and increase in flexibility. Not all workers have the chance to telecommute. One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.|$|E

We compare estimates of the total commute person-miles traveled by <b>telecommuters</b> with those of nontelecommuters, on a quarterly basis. Key findings include the following. One-way commute distances were higher for <b>telecommuters</b> than for nontelecommuters, consistent with prior empirical evidence and with expectation. Average telecommuting frequency declined over time; several explanations are proposed, but cannot be properly tested with these data. The first two findings notwithstanding, the average quarterly per capita total commute distances were generally lower for <b>telecommuters</b> than for nontelecommuters, indicating that they telecommute often enough to more than compensate for their longer one-way commutes. We cannot say from these results whether the ability to telecommute is itself prompting individuals to move farther away, or whether telecommuting is simply more attractive to people who already live farther from work for other reasons. Even if the first is true, however, and telecommuting is the 'problem', it {{also appears to be}} the solution: that is, it enables people to achieve a desired but more distant residential location without a net increase in commute travel. ...|$|R

The present study asks to what extent does the opportunity to engage in paid work while commuting to and from the workplace result in a shift in commuter modal choice away from automobile travel toward public transit.

We find that <b>telecommuters</b> consistently live farther from work (in terms of time and distance) compared to former and future <b>telecommuters.</b> These longer one-way distances are ameliorated, however, by <b>telecommuters</b> traveling at higher speeds and commuting less frequently than their counterparts, with an end result of <b>telecommuters</b> commuting fewer person-miles and person-minutes, on average.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews and}} {{utilizes}} the current body of telecommuting related research {{to study the}} costs and benefits of home-based telecommuting. Monte Carlo simulation methods were utilized to help account for costs or benefits that remain highly variable or have not been well documented by past research. This study illustrates the conditions under which the business case for telecommuting is supported or weakened. Conditions for the employee �the <b>telecommuter</b> � are generally most favorable when: � 1 � the employer bears the equipment cost; � 2 � commute distances are above average; � 3 � the commute vehicle has below-average fuel economy; � 4 � travel time is highly valued; and � 5 � telecommuting is frequent, while conditions for the employer are most favorable when: � 1 � the <b>telecommuter</b> bears the equipment cost; � 2 � there is low <b>telecommuter</b> attrition; � 3 � the employee is highly productive on telecommuting days; � 4 � the employee’s time is highly valued; and � 5 � telecommuting is frequent. For the employer, telecommuting is also favorable if parking and office space savings are realized. While public sector benefits are conceivable, they remain insignificant in most situations because the impacts on the transportation network are probably not concentrated enough over a specific transportation corridor to realize infrastructure benefits and not quantified or valued enough within a regional air district to realize significant air quality benefits. Further, the public sector loses fuel tax revenue. Altogether, this paper provides insight into the potential public sector impacts of telecommuting, as well as the federal, state, regional, and local public policy implications that arise when telecommuting is considered among other transportation demand management alternatives...|$|E

The question can be raised, however, whether <b>telecommuters</b> can be regarded as a homogeneous group with respect to their valuation of commute distance and residential preferences.
