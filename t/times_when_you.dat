[...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale." [...] Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this [...] "iconic" [...] scene: [...] "It {{was one of the few}} <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw Pauline really, really let rip... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did." [...] This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in [...] and is described by Wendy Richard as [...] "Pauline's crowning moment." ...|$|E

[...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." [...] She continued, [...] "Everything is worth it – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career.

500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

With Fenella Fielding he recorded Edith Sitwell's Façade poems with Walton's music {{played by the}} Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Neville Marriner (1972). Flanders had long been fascinated by Façade: [...] "It is an extraordinarily difficult work – even an impossible one. There are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are just forced to babble, others when you are completely swamped by the orchestra. It really pushes you to the limits".|$|E
2500|$|The dispute {{ended in}} 2010, when the pair reunited {{for a full}} tour. Paul Wall stated [...] "It {{took a long time}} and us growing. You know, we started off as a group and a lot of <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go your {{separates}} ways, a lot of people say, [...] "Oh you can't do it without him" [...] and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could make it on my own." [...] Chamillionaire replied; [...] "We had been bumping into each other a lot. It's kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It's not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing along time ago, but nobody believed us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how I felt when I read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
