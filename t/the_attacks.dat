On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe.

5|$|On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, {{acting on}} Nhu's orders, raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda, Saigon's main Buddhist temple. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> were {{replicated}} across the nation, leaving a death toll {{estimated to be}} in the hundreds. The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 monks and nuns were arrested. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare martial law. He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country. Following <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless they were used to fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrest of}} Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza in June 2012 {{provided}} further clarity {{on how the}} plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47's and RDX, which were {{to be used for}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to the dismantling of the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but couldn't complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures, that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning and execution of the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attack</b> is spoofed, that is random fake Internet source {{addresses}} {{are used}} {{which makes it}} difficult to identify the attacker.

5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> as a diversion. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal.
