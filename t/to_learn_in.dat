5|$|The School of Music {{presents}} an annual series of concerts that showcase talent {{in a variety}} of genres. School of Music at FIU offers a dynamic learning environment for informed, creative musicians. Students are fully involved in their chosen fields, where they can recognize clearly what they need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> order to become contributors to those fields. FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{went into}} {{quarters}} at Morristown {{during the winter}} of 1779–1780, which represented the worst suffering for the army during the war. The temperatures fell to 16 below zero, the New York Harbor was frozen over, and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge. In late 1779, Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln. After his success there, Clinton returned victorious to New York, leaving Cornwallis in the south. Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates, despite Washington's recommendation of Greene. Gates failed in South Carolina and was then replaced by Greene. The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp. Despite this news, Washington was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E
25|$|A second {{language}} reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes are easier <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> <b>In</b> 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 simplified characters most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier, although some people (especially in Hong Kong {{which is still}} using traditional Chinese) taught only in simplified characters were {{cut off from the}} wealth of Chinese literature written in traditional characters. Any idea of replacing ideographic script with romanized script was soon abandoned, however by government and education leaders.|$|E
30|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between engagement and attitude <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> disaffected 14 - 16 -year-olds. Vocational <b>learning</b> is seen <b>to</b> be highly engaging and promotes an overall improvement <b>in</b> general attitude <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>In</b> relation <b>to</b> school, however, there is strong evidence of reinforced negative attitudes and further disaffection when students are fully removed from this environment. Thus, the most potent recipe for dealing with disaffection in this research is {{shown to be a}} mixture of environments where a connection with school is retained.|$|R

25|$|The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was {{initially}} liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became Daugavpils), it also allowed Russian and German languages {{to be used}} in Parliament along Latvian, acknowledged minorities' rights <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> schools in their mother tongues and, despite switching public tertiary education to Latvian, did not forbid private post-secondary education in minority languages. State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian. After the 1934 Ulmanis coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed. Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson {{discusses}} an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential {{to address the needs of}} children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.|$|E
25|$|Technology is {{essential}} to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, Rashi {{was first}} brought to learn Torah {{by his father}} on Shavuot day {{at the age of}} five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> the yeshiva of Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar in Worms, {{returning}} to his wife three times yearly, for the Days of Awe, Passover and Shavuot. When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to Mainz, where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the Lorraine region straddling France and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Wasserman {{was married}} in 1899 to Michla, the {{daughter}} of Rabbi Meir Atlas, rabbi of Salantai (Salant). Wasserman lived in his father-in-law's house {{for many years and}} rejected offers of rabbinical posts (including a prestigious rabbinate in Moscow) being afforded the opportunity to learn Torah at home. He did however decide to teach, and together with Rabbi Yoel Baranchik, he started a mesivta in Amtshilov, Russia in 1903 and earned himself a reputation as an outstanding teacher. Prior to 1907, Wasserman heard that another local rabbi wanted to head the mesivta in Amtshilov and he left to avoid an argument, returning <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> his father-in-law's house. From 1907 to 1910, he studied in the Kollel Kodshim in the Raduń Yeshiva in Radun' (Radin), headed by The Chofetz Chaim. While at the kollel, Wasserman studied with Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, who would later become the rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva, for eighteen hours a day.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with attitudes <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> inter-organizational collaboration. Basic attitudes <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> evident <b>in</b> extant research -"selfish", "sharing" and "sidelined"- are compared with those observed through research-oriented action research. A conceptualization based on a characterization of the attitudes observed in the research situations is produced. It models attitudes <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> collaboration as bundles of varied stances relating to taking and giving knowledge from or to a partner, or excluding learning from the agenda altogether. The observations suggest that actual attitudes - which are evident at individual, community or organizational level - are much more varied than the basic attitudes and that they often include elements of all three -"sidelined", "selfish "and "sharing"- motivations. The model acknowledges differences in perceptions of attitudes, differences of attitudes within partner organizations {{as well as between}} them, and differences in partners' attitudes to each other over time.
