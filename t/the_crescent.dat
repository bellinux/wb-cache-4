5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that <b>the</b> <b>Crescent</b> Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires <b>the</b> <b>Crescent</b> Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and <b>the</b> <b>Crescent</b> Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. <b>The</b> <b>Crescent</b> Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E
5|$|A further terrace to {{the south}} of the Masonic Hall is split from the hall by St George's Place. It is formed of numbers 21 to 23 <b>The</b> <b>Crescent,</b> and number 42 Upper High Street. The terrace forms two listed {{building}} designations, both Grade II. Numbers 21 and 22 <b>The</b> <b>Crescent</b> are two-storey roughcast houses, each spanning three windows. The doorways are round-headed, and are flanked by ground floor bay windows. Number 23 forms the back of 42 Upper High Street, and is a two-storey red brick building.|$|E
5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. <b>The</b> <b>crescent</b> is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red is a symbol of resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that <b>the</b> <b>crescent</b> was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with <b>the</b> <b>crescent</b> on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E

The group was influenced by The Diamonds, Danny & the Juniors, The Ames Brothers, and The Mills Brothers among others. Several more appearances on [...] "Six O'Clock Rock", and more live performances created a fan base which promoter Lee Gordon couldn't ignore, signing <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> to his Leedon recording label.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> {{were not}} heated by {{radiators}} - but by advanced underfloor heating {{which was in}} {{an early stage of}} development during the 1970s. The architects proposed underfloor heating in the proposal stages in the late 1960s and <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> were completed by 1972. However the architects did not envisage the 1973 oil crisis and consequently many tenants could not afford the heating costs.|$|R

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. <b>The</b> <b>crescent</b> and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign <b>the</b> <b>crescent</b> appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E

5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. <b>The</b> <b>Crescent</b> City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as <b>the</b> <b>Crescent</b> City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing {{back and forth between the}} states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.|$|E
5000|$|Flaws in the {{construction}} process, inadequate heating and unsafe design were {{among some of the}} problems occupants faced. <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> were described by the Architects Journal as [...] "Europe's worst housing stock... hideous system-built deck-access block which gave Hulme its unsavoury reputation." [...] <b>The</b> Hulme <b>Crescents</b> had implications for new housing in Manchester and were believed to have signalled the death knell for the 'Streets in the sky' idea that had been proposed throughout the 1960s and 1970s in the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> were demolished around 1994.|$|R

In 1975, just three years after opening, a survey was conducted which found 96.3% of residents wanted to leave <b>the</b> <b>Crescents</b> and be re-housed elsewhere. In 1978, the Granada Television investigative programme World in Action questioned the suitability of Hulme <b>Crescent.</b> <b>The</b> Guardian described the development as [...] "a morass in which design faults and tenants revulsion at their environment have combined to produce a staggering number of maintenance demands and angry howls of neglect".|$|R

5000|$|By 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Crescents</b> {{had become}} so {{undesired}} by prospective residents that Manchester City Council, which lacked sufficient funds to demolish the housing scheme, stopped charging rents entirely from tenants. However the council did still provide electricity to the building to those who needed it. <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> became an eclectic place for various subculture groups such as bohemians, criminals and squatters. Unwanted by the council, occupants resorted to altering <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> themselves. <b>The</b> Kitchen was an illegal nightclub which was created from three knocked-through flats and {{was described as a}} [...] "much wilder alternative" [...] to the nearby Haçienda club. Creative residents proceeded to put their own stamp on the building and covered the dreary grey concrete surfaces in graffiti.|$|R

Following a poll of Sydney viewers of Six O'Clock Rock rating the most popular artists of 1960, <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> placed a respectable fifth behind the top solo singers of the day.

Activities included partying, and standing around the piano singing. This piano also was employed by <b>The</b> <b>Crescents</b> for practising their songs.|$|R
