What it's about is, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> called Alfred Marks, he had the Alfred Marks Bureau - he had the same name as a comedian on the radio when I was growing up. So it was just the funny paradox of seeing adverts for the Alfred Marks Bureau, the idea of some comedian having a bureau was just funny. It said 'Temporary Secretary', and I thought, that's a kind of funky thought. Then there was the secretary thing: take a letter Miss Smith, sit on my lap... all that kind of stuff.

5000|$|... “Ferry Play {{creates a}} dynamic {{relationship}} between the recording (which never changes) and <b>a</b> site that <b>is</b> constantly changing.

If your ferry has a snack bar—and if the snack bar is open—you can smell popcorn and hotdogs; if it isn’t, you can’t. Most significantly, {{the characters in the}} play change based on who is riding the ferry with the audience and what they are talking about. At the beginning of the play, a teenager looks around and says to her family: “look at that creepy guy over there.” Every time an audience member actually looks, <b>there</b> will <b>be</b> someone different to see: if the audience member sees someone they perceive as creepy, then they share the same perception; if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who doesn’t seem creepy to the listener, then the listener might decide the teen <b>is</b> judgmental; if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no one at all, we begin to wonder if she is imagining things, or if this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> game she plays with her family.” ...|$|R
