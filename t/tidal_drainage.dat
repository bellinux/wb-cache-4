40|$|The {{long-term}} (10 – 100 years) {{evolution of}} tidal channels {{is generally considered}} {{to interact with the}} bio-geomorphic evolution of the surrounding intertidal platform. Here we studied how the geometric properties of <b>tidal</b> channels (channel <b>drainage</b> density and channel width) change as (1) vegetation establishes on an initially bare intertidal platform and (2) sediment accretion on the intertidal platform leads to a reduction in the tidal prism (i. e. water volume that during a tidal cycle floods to and drains back from the intertidal platform). Based on a time series of aerial photographs and digital elevation models, we derived the channel geometric properties at different time steps during the evolution from an initially low-elevated bare tidal flat towards a high-elevated vegetated marsh. We found that vegetation establishment causes a marked increase in channel drainage density. This is explained as the friction exerted by patches of pioneer vegetation concentrates the flow in between the vegetation patches and promotes there the erosion of channels. Once vegetation has established, continued sediment accretion and tidal prism reduction do not result in significant further changes in channel drainage density and in channel widths. We hypothesize that this is explained by a partitioning of the tidal flow between concentrated channel flow, as long as the vegetation is not submerged, and more homogeneous sheet flow as the vegetation is deeply submerged. Hence, a reduction of the tidal prism due to sediment accretion on the intertidal platform, reduces especially the volume of sheet flow (which does not affect channel geometry), while the concentrated channel flow (i. e. the landscape forming volume of water) is not much affected by the tidal prism reduction...|$|R

An {{example of such a}} system is the mesotidal lagoon named Ria de Aveiro (Portugal, 40 38 /N, 08 45 W), which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single channel, 350 m wide. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the seasonal and inter-tidal variability of organic carbon fluxes between the coastal lagoon and the Ocean, and to assess the contribution of the organic carbon fractions (i. e. dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)) to the export of organic carbon to the Ria de Aveiro plume zone. The organic carbon fractions fluxes were estimated as the product of the appropriate fractional organic carbon concentrations and the water fluxes calculated by a two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic model (2 DH). Results showed that the higher exchanges of DOC and POC fractions at the system cross-section occurred during spring tides but only resulted in a net export of organic carbon in winter, totalling 85 t per tidal cycle. Derived from the winter and summer campaigns, the annual carbon mass balance estimated corresponded to a net export of organic carbon (7957 ¼ 6585 tyr- 1 POC þ 1372 tyr- 1 DOC).

40|$|This {{study was}} part of an {{integrated}} project developed in response to concerns regarding current and future land practices affecting water quality within coastal catchments and adjacent marine environments. Two forested coastal catchments on the Fraser Coast, Australia, were chosen as examples of low-modification areas with similar geomorphological and land-use characteristics to many other coastal zones in southeast Queensland. For this component of the overall project, organic, physico-chemical (Eh, pH and DO), ionic (Fe 2 +, Fe 3 +), and isotopic (ä 13 CDIC, ä 15 NDIN ä 34 SSO 4) data were used to characterise waters and identify sources and processes contributing to concentrations and form of dissolved Fe, C, N and S within the ground and surface waters of these coastal catchments. Three sites with elevated Fe concentrations are discussed in detail. These included a shallow pool with intermittent interaction with the surface water drainage system, a monitoring well within a semi-confined alluvial aquifer, and a monitoring well within the fresh/saline water mixing zone adjacent to an estuary. Conceptual models of processes occurring in these environments are presented. The primary factors influencing Fe transport were; microbial reduction of Fe 3 + oxyhydroxides in groundwaters and in the hyporheic zone of surface drainage systems, organic input available for microbial reduction and Fe 3 + complexation, bacterial activity for reduction and oxidation, iron curtain effects where saline/fresh water mixing occurs, and variation in redox conditions with depth in ground and surface water columns. Data indicated that groundwater seepage appears a more likely source of Fe to coastal waters (during periods of low rainfall) via <b>tidal</b> flux.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments carried out in a large experimental apparatus aimed at reproducing a typical lagoonal environment subject to tidal forcings. The experimental apparatus consists of two adjoining basins reproducing {{the sea and the}} lagoon. The tide is generated at the sea by a vertical steel sharp-edge weir, oscillating vertically. The weir is driven by an ad hoc developed software which continuously corrects the weir motion on the basis of water levels measured at the sea, allowing us to generate a sinusoidal tide of fixed amplitude and period, oscillating around mean water level. The bottom of the lagoon is covered by a layer of cohesionless plastic grains, with a density of 1041 kg/m 3. The cohesionless plastic grains are characterized by a nearly uniform grain size distribution, with a median grain size of 0. 8 mm. The lack of external sediment supply, the absence of vegetation, and the prevalence of bedload transport prevent any deposition processes and lateral surface accretion, attributing a purely erosive character to the experimental lagoon. As a consequence, in this experimental lagoon the main morphodynamic process responsible for tidal network initiation and development is the differential erosion between the channels and the adjacent surface. The experiments were designed in order to analyze the effects of mean sea level variations on channel network dynamics, focusing on the changes of the relevant geomorphic characteristics of the experimental networks, such as e. g. drainage density, based on the probability distribution of unchanneled lengths, and flowing tidal prism. Our results suggest that a decrease in the tidal prism leads to network retreat and contraction of channel cross sections. Conversely, an increase in the tidal prism promotes network re-incision and re-expansion of channel cross sections. In general, contractions and expansions tend to occur within the same planar blueprint and the network re-expands cutting over the vestiges of old channels. However, in some cases, network re-extension through headward growth and initiation of new tributaries follows paths which do not overlap the old ones. A tendency to develop a linear relationship between <b>tidal</b> prism and <b>drainage</b> density is observed which suggests a cyclic response of network structure in terms of efficiency in draining the landscape. The described cyclicity in the contraction-expansion process should reasonably be interpreted as a statistical tendency rather than a pointwise equivalence. Our results show that changes in tidal prism rapidly influence network efficiency in draining the landscape and the related transport processes. This highlight the importance of these experiments for quantitative predictions of the long-term ecomorphological changes of the tidal landscape to relative mean sea level variations...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1981 Dr. Kenneth George BostonThe halophytic grass Spartina townsendii (s. l.) was widely introduced from England to Australia in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s, but has established successfully only in estuaries and lagoons in the south east of the country. It now occupies 620 ha, the major stations being the Tamar River, Tasmania, where the fertile form of the grass was planted in 1947, and Andersons Inlet, Victoria, where the same vigorous species was introduced as recently as 1962. Because of their comparative youth, Australian Spartina marshes are in a much earlier stage of development than many marshes in Britain, where S. townsendii (s. l.) was first collected in 1870. It has therefore been possible to examine in this country the initial and early stages of Spartina marsh formation. Particular {{attention has been given}} to Andersons Inlet, where the growth of Spartina and the accompanying transformation from mudflat to marshland have been observed from the time of marsh inception. By 1980, Spartina in Andersons Inlet occupied 63. 6 ha. In favourable environments, Spartina cover in sample quadrats was approaching 100 per cent after 14 years from initial establishment of seedlings and young plants. Colonisation commenced within a narrow vertical range of 0. 61 m to 0. 83 m above Inverloch datum, but Spartina quickly expanded both seawards and landwards to its present vertical limits of 0. 25 m and 1. 13 m. The seaward limit of Spartina is now regularly submerged by both spring and neap tides for more than 6 hrs, while the landward limit is submerged by mean spring tides. Spartina has similar submergence limits at other Australian stations, and is most abundant in sheltered conditions regularly inundated by water of less than 18 %o salinity. At many sites the spread of Spartina has been accompanied by rapid accretion of sediment, which is trapped and retained by plant foliage. Sediment deposition in Spartina at Andersons Inlet is generally greater than 2 cm per annum, and rates of up to 7 cm per annum have been recorded. The role of Spartina in promoting accretion may be apparent even before sward formation is completed, as indicated by the development of microtopographic highs coincident with Spartina clones and clumps. As a result of high rates of accretion, previously unvegetated mudflats are rapidly transformed into depositional terraces, of which six major types may be recognised. Their upward growth is accompanied by a change from non-channelised to partly channelised tidal flow, as creeks develop between Spartina tussocks and within continuous sward. Pans may form {{on the surface of the}} marsh as a result of deposition of <b>tidal</b> wrack, impeded <b>drainage,</b> or restriction of light beneath mangroves. Spartina thus acts as a geomorphological agent, by greatly accelerating the processes of marsh formation. Open Acces...|$|R

Sediment fractions with particle size between 20 and 50 mm are preferred, independently of the fishes’ length. Smaller standard length (SL) fishes have a higher positive selection of fine grained sediments than those with a larger SL. Finer fractions usually have higher concentration of heavy metals, which makes younger specimens of the thin-lipped grey mullet potentially more exposed to heavy metal load in the estuary. Metal concentration was not independent from the sampling point, presenting higher values near the margins and the estuary <b>tidal</b> <b>drainage</b> system. This means that during the first period of each tidal cycle, the mullets will feed first on the most contaminated areas, as a consequence of their movement following the rising tide to feed on previously exposed areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} outwelling hypothesis {{states that}} small coastal embayments (e. g. estuaries, wetlands) export their excess production to inshore marine waters. In line with this notion, {{the present study}} tested whether the Swartkops estuary acts as source or sink for carbon. To this end, concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined hourly during the first monthly spring and neap tides over one year in the tidal waters entering and leaving the estuary. Each sampling session spanned a full tidal cycle, yielding a total of 936 concentration estimates. Carbon fluxes were calculated by integrating concentrations with water flow rates derived from a hydrodynamic model calibrated for each sampling datum. Over the year, exports to marine waters markedly exceeded imports to the estuary for all carbon species: {{on the basis of}} total spring <b>tidal</b> <b>drainage</b> area, 1083 g m- 2 of DIC, 103 g m- 2 of DOC, and 123 g m- 2 of POC left the estuary annually. Total carbon export from the estuary to the ocean amounted to 4755 tonnes, of which 83 % was in the inorganic form (DIC). Thus, the bulk of carbon moving in the water column is inorganic - yet, DIC seems to be measured only rarely in most flux studies of this nature. Salt marshes cover extensive areas in this estuary and produce some carbon, particularly DOC, but productivity of the local Spartina species is low (P:B = 1. 1). Consequently, the bulk of carbon exported from the estuary appears to originate from the highly productive macroinvertebrate and the phytoplankton component and not from the salt marsh plants...|$|E
40|$|Some seven tenths of the earth's {{surface is}} {{occupied}} by sea water containing roughly {{three and a half}} per cent salts in solution. It is therefore not surprising that many sciences are applied to the study of this medium and an understanding of the chemistry of the sea is basic to all the other studies. A knowledge of variations in salt concentration, distribution of suspended material, thermal gradients &c. is required for the oceanographic study of translation of water masses. In ocean waters remote from the influence of <b>tidal</b> action, land <b>drainage</b> and similar disturbances, slight changes in the above-mentioned properties may be of considerable significance. In marine biology, inter alia, a knowledge of the cheinical nature of the waters is required. In this case considerable emphasis is laid on analysis such as the determination of phosphate, organic nitrogen, carbonaceous matter 8 cc. Within the field of fishery research and development, pollution control and marine engineering, the chemical analysis of sea water forms an integral part of most projects. There are many determinations common to several, if not all, the individual studies of sea water. The standard of accuracy, or rather discrimination, to which any particular property is determined is dependent upon the application to which the result is subsequently to be put. For instance, the determination of salinity (see page 4 'E in the oceanographic study of current distribution requires values quoted to at least. i. 500 parts per million (p. p. m.). For fishery development work applied to the cultivation of shellfish however, salinity values quoted to ± 5000 p. p. m. would be satisfactory. Certain parameters, frequently involved in sea water studies, are considerably influenced by the apparatus and method used for sasnpling (see page 26). Accuracy is thus often limited by sampling rather than analytical technique. The complexity of the problem of general water analysis may be seen by examining Table 1 below. This table is not intended as an exhaustive list of analytical methods nor of their applications to water analysis. It is intended as a brief indication of the range of analytical techniques required for general water studies. frequently, with sea water analysis, large numbers of sampies require analysing on a routine basis. Sometimes, due to the need for further samples on a successive tidal cycle, or perhaps deteriorating weather conditions in the open sea, a rather tight time limit for completion of analysis is imposed. It is in cases such as this that some electroanalytical techniques are particularly suitable although there are also many other applications where these methods have replaced older methods by virtue of improved accuracy and speed. Whitnac 7 sums up the position nicely in his paper "The application of cathode ray polarography in the field of oceanography" in which he states:- "Present day research on the physical, chemical and biological phenomena of the deep ocean has placed new requirements on the methods of analysis that are needed in support of this work. Modern electroanalytical methods appear to have the desired range of precision, reproducibility and sensitivity that will be required, plus the feature of using the basic principles in direct reading instrumentation with digital recording of data. ...|$|R
