5|$|The French {{responded by}} attacking and {{capturing}} Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754.

Upon his return <b>to</b> <b>Virginia,</b> Washington refused to accept a demotion {{to the rank of}} captain, and resigned his commission. Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.|$|E

5|$|The loss <b>to</b> <b>Virginia</b> brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he expected at the season's start.

Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities.
