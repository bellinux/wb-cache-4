5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, two girls fall victim to the Apathy Syndrome {{in front of the}} school which prompts {{widespread}} rumors. Yukari, Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki (Kazuya Nakai) that <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night. On June 8, Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school's gymnasium. However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night, she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the Apathy cases after being preyed on by Shadows. That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her. However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them, Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission. Instead, Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at the dorm where he listens to Natsuki's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her as a friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{collapse}} of the jail, the arrest and planned deportation of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> enraged Quantrill's guerillas; George Todd left a note for General Ewing threatening to burn Kansas City unless the girls were freed.

On 10 August, a reconstruction of the girls' movements was produced using two child actresses to encourage witnesses to come forward.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 7 September 2007, senior counsel for the defence, Edgar Prais QC, made a submission under section 97 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, that Sinclair had no case to answer in respect of the charges libelled, due to an insufficiency of evidence. In particular, he contended that the Crown had failed to lead evidence that Angus Sinclair {{had been involved in}} acting with force or violence against the girls, and that the advocate depute had not led evidence to prove that any sexual encounter between the panel and <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> not been consensual.|$|E

The club became famous for its troupe of 40 scantily clad fan dancers and for Guinan's distinctive aplomb, which made her a celebrity. Arrested several times for serving alcohol and providing entertainment, she always claimed that the patrons had brought the liquor in with them, and the club was so small that <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> to dance close to the customers. Guinan maintained that she had never sold an alcoholic drink in her life.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} study of U.S. 1,632 {{students}} from 79 different schools, {{boys and girls}} were surveyed {{and asked if they}} had, at some time, been asked to engage in unwelcome sexual behavior. 85% of the girls and 76% of the boys said that this had occurred. The boys and girls indicated that the behavior they experienced included pinching, grabbing, touching in a sexual manner. One fourth of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been forced to kiss someone and 10% of both the girls and the boys reported having been forced against their wills to do something sexual other than kissing. Students reported that 80% of the unwelcome sexual behavior had come from other students, and 20% had come from teachers, coaches, or other adults. Out of the total of child abuse rates, slightly more than 75% were neglected, 18% were assaulted and slightly more than nine percent were sexually abused.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E

25|$|With the {{affirmation}} of the Romanian nation, {{in the context of}} the European revolutions of 1848, was explicitly questioned the issue on university in national language. At the express request of the Romanians, in 1870, József Eötvös, then Minister of Education, proposes the creation in Cluj of a university teaching in Hungarian, Romanian and German, idea also welcomed by the Romanian elite. Meanwhile, Eötvös dies, and in 1872, Franz Joseph I legislates the establishment of the Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsvár in Hungarian only, which caused dissatisfaction among Romanians. After the oath, on 20 December 1872, 258 students start courses. There were created four distinct faculties: Faculty of Law and State Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and History, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The faculties were equal to each other and enjoyed internal autonomy. The first rector was Professor Áron Berde from the Faculty of Law, specialist in economics and finance. Besides the four faculties is created a Pedagogical Institute, for training secondary school teachers. From 1895 <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> the right to learn at university.|$|E

I was like, 'This is insane!' After Seattle, all of the shows were moved to arenas. I've never done a bus tour. Everyone says they are really fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Debbie Swenson's real daughter, Kelli Burke (born Kelli Jo Swenson in 1985), who was {{in middle}} school {{at the time in}} Gracemont, Oklahoma, created the online persona of [...] "Kaycee Nicole" [...] with a group of her friends. [...] The group created a webpage for the nonexistent girl and used photos of a high school {{basketball}} player from their town to represent her, but do not seem to have played the role of Kaycee beyond that or given her an active persona. [...] That came when Debbie Swenson discovered what <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> done and, rather than forcibly discontinue the hoax, she adopted the persona and began playing the role of Kaycee.

500|$|Every summer, Hayao Miyazaki {{spent his}} {{vacation}} at a mountain cabin {{with his family}} and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, which were for small children and teenagers, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like [...] Nakayoshi and Ribon <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes" [...] and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they [...] "held dear in their hearts" [...] and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.|$|E
