Sherry Turkle enlists deconstructive {{theory to}} celebrate the computer age {{as the embodiment of}} “difference. ” No longer just a theory, one can now live a “virtual ” life. Within a differential but ontologically detached field of signifiers, one can construct and reconstruct egos and environments from the bottom up and endlessly. Lucas Introna, in contrast, enlists the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas to condemn the same computer age for increasing the distance between flesh and blood people. Mediating the face-to-face relation between real people, allowing and encouraging communication at a distance, information technology would alienate individuals from the social immediacy productive of moral obligations and responsibilities. In this paper I argue against both of these positions, and for similar reasons. Turkle’s celebration and Introna’s condemnation of information technology both depend, so I will argue, on the same mistaken meta-interpretation of it. Like Introna, however, but to achieve a different end, I will enlist Levinas’s ethical philosophy to make this case.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{evolving}} role of transmitter spectrum masks {{in the emerging}} paradigm of service and technology neutral spectrum planning. We advocate the use of more dynamic approaches to spectrum mask generation and design. Furthermore, we advocate a role for such masks {{in the implementation of}} dynamic spectrum access networks. In this paper we distinguish between the block-edge mask (BEM) and the spectrum emission mask (SEM). A block-edge mask specifies permitted power levels over the block of spectrum of interest and its neighbouring blocks. The spectrum emission mask on the other hand describes the actual emission profile of a device. We show how advancements in technologies, especially in the area of cognitive radio and reconfigurable networks, make the notion of dynamic SEMs a reality and we argue that a more dynamic approach to BEMs opens the way for enabling <b>technology</b> and service <b>neutrality</b> in spectrum management.

40|$|Introduction – The {{scene for}} this thesis {{is set in}} the highly {{regulated}} automotive industry. Recent scandals in the automotive industry have shown that companies have manipulated their emission results in order to pass regulations. The regulations are from the beginning implemented to protect the environment and encourage companies to develop green innovation but the authors question if regulations puts more pressure on the companies than they can handle. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how regulations affect green innovation. Method – The authors adopted a pragmatist research philosophy and used an abductive research method. The empirical data has been gathered through a qualitative study, conducting semi structured interviews with companies within the automotive industry. The abductive research approach meant that the frame of reference has been updated and revised when new data, which was previously not covered in the theory, was gained from the interviews. With a five-step process the authors have analyzed the empirical data with the frame of references and from the result drawn conclusion. Conclusion – The conclusions drawn in this thesis is that regulations {{have a positive impact on}} companies green incremental innovation and can have both an inhibitory and a positive effect on radical green innovation. However, there are few underlying factors affecting the outcome such as infrastructure, <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> and communication. Contribution – The contribution of this thesis has added new qualitative knowledge to the research field on how regulations affect green innovation. By localizing and highlighting the factors found in the conclusion, companies and policy makers can cooperate to enhance the development of green radical innovations in the future. Future research - Future researcher are encouraged to investigate how infrastructure, <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> and communication each are affecting green radical innovation.

40|$|This review {{highlights}} {{recent developments}} and future perspectives in carbon dioxide usage for the sustainable {{production of energy}} and chemicals and to reduce global warming. We discuss the heterogeneously catalysed hydrogenation, {{as well as the}} photocatalytic and electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to hydrocarbons or oxygenates. Various sources of hydrogen are also reviewed in terms of their CO 2 <b>neutrality.</b> <b>Technologies</b> have been developed for large-scale CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol or methane. Their industrial application is, however, limited by the high price of renewable hydrogen and the availability of large-volume sources of pure CO 2. With regard to the direct electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to value-added chemicals, substantial advances in electrodes, electrolyte, and reactor design are still required to permit the development of commercial processes. Therefore, in this review particular attention is paid to (i) the design of metal electrodes to improve their performance and (ii) recent developments of alternative approaches such as the application of ionic liquids as electrolytes and of microorganisms as co-catalysts. The most significant improvements both in catalyst and reactor design are needed for the photocatalytic functionalisation of CO 2 to become a viable technology that can help in the usage of CO 2 as a feedstock for the production of energy and chemicals. Apart from technological aspects and catalytic performance, we also discuss fundamental strategies for the rational design of materials for effective transformations of CO 2 to value-added chemicals with the help of H 2, electricity and/or light...|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} {{pervasive}} computing promises {{a shift from}} information technology per se to what {{can be accomplished by}} using it, thereby fundamentally changing the relationship between people and information technology. In order to realize this vision, a large number of issues concerning user experience, contextual change, and technical requirements should be addressed. We provide a design rationale for pervasive computing that encompasses these issues, in which we argue that a prominent aspect of user experience is to provide user control, primarily founded in human values. As one of the more significant aspects of the user experience, we provide an extended discussion about privacy. With contextual change, we address the fundamental change in previously established relationships between the practices of individuals, social institutions, and physical environments that pervasive computing entails. Finally, issues of technical requirements refer to <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> and openness [...] factors that we argue are fundamental for realizing pervasive computing. We describe a number of empirical and technical studies, the results of which have helped to verify aspects of the design rationale as well as shaping new aspects of it. The empirical studies include an ethnographic-inspired study focusing on information technology support for everyday activities, a study based on structured interviews concerning relationships between contexts of use and everyday planning activities, and a focus group study of laypeople’s interpretations of the concept of privacy in relation to information technology. The first technical study concerns the model of personal service environments as a means for addressing a number of challenges concerning user experience, contextual change, and technical requirements. Two other technical studies relate to a model for device-independent service development and the wearable server as a means to address issues of continuous usage experience and <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> respectively. ...|$|E

Thus consumer demand responses work at cross purposed to the goal of reducing emissions (especially as average cost pricing is used for electricity). Second, it is difficult to achieve <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> with subsidies-here defined as an equal subsidy cost per ton of CO 2 avoided. Third, many subsidies are inframarginal.

Technology is the part and parcel of present people's daily life having aesthetic and devil impact on world.

40|$|The pressures, {{from outside}} and inside {{education}} to digitize, to computerise, and 'to go online' {{continue to increase}} in pace. The rhetoric surrounding such pressures are often argued from a standpoint that positions technology as a 'neutral tool', a tool that will help make work more efficient and effective. The central thesis of this presentation is that technology is best understood as fundamentally non-neutral and that various technological applications privilege certain ways of doing things, and exclude or restrict other ways. And further, that technology not only can influence but can have a transformative effect on what the technology is used for, and on the work practices of those that use it. Technology is often viewed for what it provides and seldom for what it takes away or limits.

Given what we stand to lose, {{we ought to be}} cautious with groundbreaking technological progress. It {{does not mean that we}} have to move any slower, but we should think about potential consequences of the steps that we take. This article maps out the recently launched {{face recognition}} apps and some emerging regulatory responses to offer initial policy considerations. With respect to current apps, app developers should consider how the relevant individuals could be put on notice given that the apps will not only be using information about their users, but also about the persons being identified. They should also consider how the apps could minimize their data collection and retention and keep the data secure. Today’s face recognition apps mostly use photos from social networks. They therefore call for regulatory responses that consider the context in which users originally shared the photos. Most importantly, the article highlights that the Federal Trade Commission’s first policy response to consumer applications that use face recognition did not follow the well-established principle of <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality.</b> The article argues that any regulation with respect to identification in real time should be technology neutral and narrowly address harmful uses of computer vision without hampering the development of useful applications...|$|E
40|$|In 2014, European {{heads of}} state {{selected}} new targets for the EU {{as part of the}} 2030 climate and energy framework. The targets will guide the ambition and nature of EU policy in this area until 2030 and are likely to have important implications for Europe’s transition to a low-carbon economy. The decision taken by the European Council was preceded by several years of vigorous interaction between interest groups, the European Commission and the member states. The outcome of this interaction set the agenda for EU climate and energy policy but the role of interest groups in climate and energy policy, especially relative to important economic ideas, is relatively under researched. By augmenting and applying the multiple streams approach developed by John Kingdon in the 1980 s and using process-tracing techniques, this thesis contributes a detailed case study of this important instance of European interest representation. It is found that the complex and dynamic political context for the interaction made planning and executing advocacy campaigns challenging for all actors. The debate about the 2030 framework is shown to hinge on the idea of technology-neutrality and its status on the policymaking agenda. A number of policy coalitions are observed {{with a wide range of}} characteristics, some novel. Several attempts at ‘policy entrepreneurship’ by interest groups are recorded but most were disrupted by the confused and fast-changing political situation. It is shown that a combination of spill-over between policy windows, framing and coalition building activity served to push the idea of <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality</b> up the agenda. The multiple streams approach is shown to be broadly applicable to the research context and aims but greater agency over policy windows than originally assumed must be granted to actors and the possibility for successful policy entrepreneurship to yield unintended policy outcomes allowed for.

Local loop unbundling (LLU) regulation is one of the main strategies to open access to an incumbent's bottleneck network in order to soften its monopoly power and encourage competition in the digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband market. Many studies, however, suggest that LLU regulation can slow down new infrastructure investment. Fibre optic technology is also increasingly becoming an option for the next generation network (NGN). This development is turning out to be the new challenge for regulators, incumbents and new entrants. With the similarities to DSL broadband and the move towards <b>technology</b> <b>neutrality,</b> regulators may also be able to adjust their future next generation access (NGA) regulation by learning from the strengths and weaknesses of LLU regulation. This paper therefore aims to analyse the impacts of unbundling policy on various aspects of broadband adoption that can be presented as consumer welfare. The possible adaptation to NGA regulation is also discussed in this paper. The empirical results of this study show that LLU regulation is one of the strategies to increase broadband adoption, particularly in the countries that have difficulty encouraging infrastructure competition. Nevertheless, several studies suggest that unbundling regulation reduces the incumbent's incentive to invest. With the dramatic growth in technologies, the main policy to increase broadband penetration should be competition between them, while unbundling regulation can be implemented carefully and differently in each country that has inefficiency that is harmful to consumers in its market from a monopoly incumbent. The decision to apply access regulation from DSL to fibre technology is therefore crucial to whether the regulator regulates the NGN market from the early stage of investment or waits for the NGN market to become more mature. Alternatively, the regulator can opt not to intervene in the market for a certain period of time, as access regulation can delay the growth in infrastructure investment...|$|E
