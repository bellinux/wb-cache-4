25|$|Insurance {{involves}} pooling {{funds from}} many insured entities (known as exposures) {{to pay for}} the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an insurable risk, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>insured</b> against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and {{a major part of the}} financial services industry, but individual entities can also self-insure through saving money for possible future losses.|$|E
5000|$|The strict common-law approach, which {{requires}} exact performance of an undertaking {{that has not}} necessarily been established as a “material” aspect of the contract (and risk assessment), and entitles the insurer to cancel a contract {{on the basis of}} a breach of warranty despite the fact that the representation complained of concerns an immaterial inaccuracy, or a matter with no bearing at all on <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>insured</b> against, has led to absurd results in some cases. Jordan v New Zealand, discussed above, is one such example: Jordan stated that his age at his next birthday would be twenty-two, whereas in fact it would be twenty-three. Since this statement was warranted, the insurer was entitled to repudiate liability, in spite of what most would regard as the immateriality of the inaccuracy, and where, in fact, it [...] "was actually to the advantage of the insurer." ...|$|E
40|$|In the Bayesian approach, the {{experience}} rated premium {{is the value}} which minimizes an expected loss {{with respect to a}} posterior distribution.

An exact analytical calculation for {{the experience}} rated premium is possible under restrictive circumstances only, regarding the prior distribution, the likelihood function, and the loss function. In this article we provide an analytical asymptotic approximation as n → ∞ for the experience rated premium. This approximation can be obtained under more general circumstances, it is simple to compute, and it inherits the good accuracy of the Laplace approximation on which it is based.

40|$|This study {{sets out}} a {{quantitative}} {{overview of the}} economy of London during the period 1775 to 1825.

Represented are over 1300 separate trades covering the entire spectrum of manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail distribution, transport and the service sector. To complement this data, use has also been made of trade directories, bankruptcy files, trade card collections, Census data and contemporary literature on London trades, including career guides. In order to analyse trends over this period, the database uses a version of the modern Standard Industrial Classification modified by the author. The 1300 separate trades are grouped into 101 sectors within seven main divisions of the economy. The database includes the name(s) of the proprietors of the business, the address, the trade and details of <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>insured.</b> From this it has been possible to present statistical evidence on a number of areas of controversy about the role of London during the Industrial Revolution.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{information}} distribution on optimal risk-sharing between different parties {{has been an}} important field of research over the past 30 years. In the literature of insurance, however, the focus has remained essentially on one configuration: insurers (the principal) propose a contract to insured (the agent), but are unable to observe perfectly <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of their <b>insured</b> who can. This asymmetry of information {{is the source of the}} well-known adverse selection effect that leads higher risk individuals to buy full or near-full insurance, while lower risk buy less complete coverage, if they buy at all. While the prediction seems to hold in some markets, there is growing empirical evidence it does not in a number of others (advantageous selection or no selection at all). This paper proposes a model of risk-sharing between two risk-averse agents that expands the traditional approach by studying 4 different cases. It comprises two possible allocations of information (<b>the</b> <b>insured</b> knows <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> better, or <b>the</b> insurer knows <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> better) and of market power (the principal is the insurer, or the insured). We show that when the insurer is the principal and is less informed, we have the traditional adverse selection effect: high risks are optimally covered, low risks are not. When the insurer is the principal but knows more about <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> than <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> (reversed asymmetric information), the result is reversed: high risks are not optimally covered, but low risks are. These results are mirrored when the market power is reversed (i. e., the insured is the principal, not the insurer). Many economic situations are specific cases of our setting...|$|R
