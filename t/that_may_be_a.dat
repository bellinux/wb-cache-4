5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, University of Chicago {{paleontologist}} Neil Shubin and Academy of Natural Sciences paleontologist Ted Daeschler {{reported the}} discovery of the fossil of a Paleozoic (ca. 375 Ma) fish, named Tiktaalik roseae, in the former stream beds of Ellesmere Island. The fossil exhibits many characteristics of fish, but also indicates a transitional creature <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> predecessor of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} personage {{from the}} legend of the Nibelungs is Gunnarr. On the Västerljung Runestone, there are three sides and one of them shows a man whose arms and legs are encircled by snakes. He is holding his arms stretched out gripping an object <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> harp, but that part is damaged due to flaking. The image appears to be depicting an older version of the Gunnarr legend in which he played the harp with his fingers, which appears in the archaic eddic poem Atlakviða.|$|E
25|$|The {{monument}} is now {{named after}} the life-size female figures in wind-blown drapery. Eleven survive, {{which would have been}} enough to fill the spaces between columns on the east and west sides, and the three on the north. Jenkins speculates that there might never have been figures on the south side. They are identified as sea-nymphs because various sculpted sea creatures were found under the feet of seven of them, including dolphins, a cuttlefish, and a bird <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sea-gull. They have generally been called Nereids, though Thurstan Robinson argues that this is imposing a Greek perspective on Lycian sculptures, and that they should rather be seen as eliyãna, Lycian water-nymphs associated with fresh-water sources and referenced on the Letoon trilingual inscription, which was discovered a few kilometres to the south of the site of the Monument.|$|E

500|$|No {{complete}} autograph score exists; fragments representing {{about three-quarters}} of the 1711 score are held by the Royal Music Library (a subdivision of the British Library in London) and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The oldest complete score, dating from about 1716, is an error-strewn manuscript <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> copy from {{one or more of}} the performing scores from that period. The manuscript bears numerous notes and corrections in Handel's hand, and was possibly the basis for the substantial revisions which he effected in 1731. It was also used by the copyist John Christopher Smith to produce two performing scores for the 1720s Hamburg performances. Further complete manuscript copies were produced by Smith and others in 1725–28 (the [...] "Malmesbury" [...] score), 1740 ("Lennard") and 1745 ("Granville"). These provide many variations of individual numbers.|$|E

500|$|Sonnet 102 {{is a part}} of the Fair Youth sequence, and it is also {{connected}} with the surrounding sonnets (100, 101, and 103) in detailing a silence that has arisen between the poet and his muse. David West contends that this sequence may be in response to the Rival Poet sequence. The Rival Poet sequence of sonnets mention a rival for either the affections of the Fair Youth, or that they are addressing other writers <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "worthier pen" [...] (Sonnet 79). There is a rather long list of people that scholars believe are likely candidates for the title of the fair youth addressed in the Sonnets: William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke; Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery; and Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton are the most common candidates.|$|E
500|$|Animals {{are shown}} {{punishing}} humans, subjecting them to nightmarish torments that may symbolise the seven deadly sins, matching the torment to the sin. Sitting on an object <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> toilet or a throne, the panel's centerpiece is a gigantic bird-headed monster feasting on human corpses, which he excretes through a cavity below him, into the transparent chamber pot {{on which he}} sits. The monster is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Prince of Hell", a name derived from the cauldron he wears on his head, perhaps representing a debased crown. To his feet a female has her face reflected on the buttocks of a demon. Further to the left, next to a hare-headed demon, a group of naked persons around a toppled gambling table are being massacred with swords and knives. Other brutal violence is shown by a knight torn down and eaten up by a pack of wolves {{to the right of the}} tree-man.|$|E
500|$|A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, {{not only}} {{contains}} a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> response to The Well. Ladies Almanack is a roman à clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father [...] "pac his library {{in the most}} normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: [...] "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing... Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" [...] Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.|$|E
