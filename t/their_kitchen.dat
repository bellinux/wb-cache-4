5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E

25|$|The Kitchen Chamber {{is where}} the {{servants}} slept and food was stored. It is unpanelled and has no ceiling. Its position next to the back stairs and above the kitchen made it accessible to the servants. Many local houses used <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> chambers for storage. In 1611 it had five arks for storing meal and grain. Today it has one great ark {{and a collection of}} food chests. Lack of a fireplace and unpanelled walls would have made it cold in winter, although warmth from the kitchen below would keep the stored food dry.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} senior {{citizens}} is rapidly increasing, which consequently signifi es {{an increase in the}} number of people having sight, hearing or memory diffi culties, people with hampered mobility, and people who find it increasingly diffi cult to process information. Elderly persons experience a greater degree of risk whilst performing daily tasks in <b>their</b> <b>kitchens.</b> Moreover, they are more susceptible to infection and illnesses, necessitating greater care to achieve hygienic conditions within <b>their</b> <b>kitchens.</b> The goal of our research was to determine whether people are generally content with the functionality of <b>their</b> <b>kitchens</b> and whether the degree of dissatisfaction increases with the age of the users. The study aims to pinpoint any major problems facing elderly people whilst working in <b>their</b> <b>kitchens</b> and to establish criteria for kitchen furniture design that could be tailored to senior users’ interests, with the focus on safety. This research was carried out via individual surveys at the respondents’ homes. 204 respondents participated in the research. The results show that most users do not realize that, with more appropriate kitchen equipment, they could perform daily tasks faster, safer, and with less effort. Common shortcomings include insuffi cient lighting (32 %), inappropriate sequential composition of work surfaces (56 %), ease of hygiene maintenance (68 %), inappropriately - shaped furniture (72 %), and tasks that become troublesome because of declining memory (75 %). We believe that it is necessary to design kitchen equipment specifically adjusted for the needs of the elderly...|$|R

25|$|Every year humans add 25 {{billion tons}} of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half of it comes from their {{domestic}} activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their electrical requirements are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not bad people, but as Westerners, they {{have one of the}} most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO2 {{over the course of a}} year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches <b>their</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a landfill, it heats up as it decomposes and releases greenhouse gases. Mr Carbon's business trips by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO2. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly air pollution is 45 tons.|$|E
500|$|The third {{reason the}} product was brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding LTO products; instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Chicken Fries were part of that goal, with the re-introduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] product the menu without adding permanent complexity to <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> operations.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1859, Bizet and several companions {{travelled}} {{in the mountains and}} forests around Anagni and Frosinone. They also visited a convict settlement at Anzio; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences. In August, he made an extended journey south to Naples and Pompeii, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: [...] "Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> utensils..." [...] Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his Roma symphony, was not finished until 1868. On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete [...] "an important work" [...] (which has not been identified). In September 1860, while visiting Venice with his friend and fellow-laureate Ernest Guiraud, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1974, Lennon and Pang {{returned}} {{to live in}} New York City. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool—while living at his aunt Mimi's house—he and Pang adopted two cats which they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album, the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street, where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23, 1974, from their terrace, which had {{a panoramic view of}} east New York. To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon's [...] "official" [...] photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, [...] "I’m not going to call up the newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night'". Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived.|$|E

500|$|A {{primary reason}} {{the product was}} brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering (LTO) products. [...] Instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Along with its BK Chicken Fries product, the Big King {{was part of that}} goal, with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older, possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product. In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public's feelings of nostalgia for these products. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to <b>their</b> <b>kitchen</b> operations. The Chicken Big King was introduced because of an increased spike in demand for chicken-based products, coupled with the success of the Big King's reintroduction.|$|E
