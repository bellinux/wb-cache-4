40|$|Background. Repeat <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>tests</b> may {{be false}} {{positive}} due to boosting of waned immunity to past mycobacterial exposure.

We compared converters with non-converters, assessed {{the probability of}} each of four combinations of ELISPOT results over the two time points and estimated boosting with adjustment for ELISPOT sensitivity and specificity. 704 (72 %) contacts had a repeat tuberculin test; 176 (25 %) had test conversion, which increased with exposure to a case (p = 0. 002), increasing age (p = 0. 0006) and BCG scar (p = 0. 06). 114 <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> converters had ELISPOT results: 16 (14 %) were recruitment positive/follow-up positive, 9 (8 %) positive/negative, 34 (30 %) negative/positive, and 55 (48 %) were negative/negative.
