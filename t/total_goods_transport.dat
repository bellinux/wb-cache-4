40|$|The {{market share}} and the {{development}} of intermodal haulages, they are still at a very low level. It amounts in <b>total</b> <b>goods</b> <b>transported</b> by rail to 2, 5 % - 3 %. The major reason for this situation is lack of coherent method for intermodal network designing. Such method should take into consideration strong relations between transport users, transport service providers, so the micro scale, as well as the regions where they are operating, so the meta scale. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present method which makes possible elimination of existing barriers in intermodal transport. The proposed method, for the sake of relations between actors involved in intermodal transport organisation, refers to multi-agent system concept. This system assumes coordinated actions in favour of concrete problem solution with support of cooperating agents, that is, in described paper, actors connected with intermodal transport. Paper presents results of the research project N 509 398536, called: „Intermodal logistics network in Poland – concept of model solutions and implementation aspects” carried out by the Institute of Logistics and Warehousing under scientific leadership of professor Leszek Mindur...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{greening}} logistics can {{be reached}} in different ways, but basically green logistics focuses on increased and better use of environmentally friendlier technologies, and on reducing the <b>total</b> amount of <b>goods</b> <b>transported</b> [2], where the latter relates to the design and management of logistics systems. This implies {{that none of these}} ways by itself would be enough in order to reach ambitious carbon reduction goals, but efforts are needed in both areas (ibid.).|$|R
50|$|According to Eurostat, Greece's largest port by tons of <b>goods</b> <b>transported</b> in 2010 is {{the port}} of Aghioi Theodoroi, with 17.38 million tons. The Port of Thessaloniki comes second with 15.8 million tons, {{followed}} by the Port of Piraeus, with 13.2 million tons, and {{the port of}} Eleusis, with 12.37 million tons. The <b>total</b> number of <b>goods</b> <b>transported</b> through Greece in 2010 amounted to 124.38 million tons, a considerable drop from the 164.3 million tons transported through the country in 2007. Since then, Piraeus has grown to become the Mediterranean's third-largest port thanks to heavy investment by Chinese logistics giant COSCO. In 2013, Piraeus was declared the fastest-growing port in the world.|$|R
30|$|Results {{estimation}} {{procedure is}} done for each 4 – 5  weeks period, over a sampling of 800 vehicles per week (52  weeks, 41, 600 vehicles per year), using an expansion stratified estimator corrected for the vehicles that not correspond to the survey and fails [23]. The strata are not sampled {{at the same rate}} as there are large differences in the population of each strata. Consequently, the size of sampling in each strata is done using the minimum variance criteria. A substitute sampling of 200 vehicles per week is considered to keep the effective sampling. The analysis is performed using the random stratified sampling procedure in SAS statistical software [24]. The methods used by PRFSS in compiling the data involve sample methodology which measures the quality of the survey. The percentage standard error (95 % confidence) of the annual estimates for tonnes transported, tonne-kilometres performed and total kilometers travelled loaded for <b>total</b> <b>goods</b> road <b>transport</b> and for national <b>goods</b> road <b>transport</b> shall not be greater than ± 5 % [18].|$|R
30|$|Previous data {{analyses}} of traffic flows show {{the importance of}} Čierna nad Tisou as a border crossing station. For example, traffic volume with Ukraine is a one-third of the <b>total</b> volume of <b>goods</b> <b>transported</b> by ZSSK Cargo (Slovakia’s biggest freight railway undertaking), and if an alternative route were to be found it would mean huge problems not only for freight undertakings but also for railway infrastructure managers in Slovakia. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} optimise technological services in border stations because we need to minimise the time trains spend there. Of course, all factors which influence this situation (customs, transport laws, technical problems, reloading of goods) must also be taken into account. For example, when goods are at a station waiting for reloading or are delayed by customs, their owner suffers financial lost. We can conclude that faster transport would cut costs for all stakeholders in the transport chain: infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, owners of goods, customers, etc.|$|R
40|$|Safety of {{dangerous}} <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> {{is directly related}} to the operation safety {{of dangerous}} <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprise. Aiming at the problem of the high accident rate and large harm in dangerous goods logistics transportation, this paper took the group decision making problem based on integration and coordination thought into a multiagent multiobjective group decision making problem; a secondary decision model was established and applied to the safety assessment of dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprise. First of all, we used dynamic multivalue background and entropy theory building the first level multiobjective decision model. Secondly, experts were to empower according to the principle of clustering analysis, and combining with the relative entropy theory to establish a secondary rally optimization model based on relative entropy in group decision making, and discuss the solution of the model. Then, after investigation and analysis, we establish the dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprise safety evaluation index system. Finally, case analysis to five dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprises in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region validates the feasibility and effectiveness of this model for dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprise recognition, which provides vital decision making basis for recognizing the dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Transport plays a {{controversial}} role and highly related to almost {{all sectors of}} human activities. It {{plays an important role}} in stimulating economy and promoting the well being and quality of human life. However, its negative impact on the environment in the form of pollution is increasing at a high rate, and thus becoming a serious threat to plant, animal and human life. In the recent decades, <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> has been intensified and its contribution to the environmental deterioration is steadily increasing. Transport of agricultural produce, means of production, food and wood is a significant component of <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> as a whole in Sweden, and the trend of intensification is analogous with other sectors. The paper addresses the transport-induced environmental constraints with especial emphasis on <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> in agricultural sector. Brief analysis is made on the causes and effects of <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> intensification. Global and national awareness on the amelioration of the most pervasive environmental problems such as pollution, global warming and ozone depletion are presented. A brief account is given on goods flow within farms, to and from farms and the tendencies in production, holdings, and transport demand in each sub-sector is discussed. The paper presents also the general visions and strategies to reach the goal of the development of environmentally sustainable <b>goods</b> <b>transport.</b> It emphasized the role of Information Technology to attenuate the intensity of transport and its consequence on environment. Finally, the role of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and its sectoral responsibility in agricultural transport is highlighted and some plausible proposals are forwarded to facilitate research and education to promote the environmentally sustainable <b>goods</b> <b>transport</b> in the sector...|$|R
