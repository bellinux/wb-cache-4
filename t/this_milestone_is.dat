5000|$|Journey is {{considered}} to be a widely innovative release that was [...] "ahead of its time," [...] and {{is considered}} underrated. Mark Paytress said the album [...] "remains a classic of pioneering electronic rock, up there with Kraftwerk and assorted krautrock trailblazers." [...] Alan Holmes of Freq said that [...] "Journey was so far ahead of its time that you have to keep checking the sleeve to make sure that it really does say 1973 and not 1983. Nowhere is this more apparent than on opening track “Time Captives”- imagine the shock of playing this record for the first time in 1973 and being faced with a full minute of minimal drum machine before a one note bass and guitar riff enter and proceed to speed up and slow down while atonal electronics swirl around for a further three minutes. Taken on its own, this opening section could easily be passed off as a lost Cabaret Voltaire or RBE track from a decade later, but this is only one aspect of Journey, and as the name suggests, we are taken on a unique trip that had no obvious precedents at the time." [...] He said [...] "it’s astonishing to think that Journey was recorded at the same time as Dark Side of the Moon, so much more advanced is it than the more well known work" [...] and commented after the release of the 2010 remaster that [...] "now that <b>this</b> <b>milestone</b> <b>is</b> once more available, maybe it stands a chance of being reassessed not only as Arthur Brown’s masterpiece, but also as one of the truly great albums of the seventies." [...] Space rock band Hawkwind named a song [...] "Journey" [...] on their twentieth studio album Alien 4 (1995) in what is believed to be a reference to their guitarist David Brocks enthusiasm for Arthur Brown and Journey.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of {{the first phase of the}} project entitled ''In-situ, Long-term Monitoring System for Radioactive Contaminants. '' Phase one of this effort included four objectives, each with specific success criteria. The first objective was to produce dosimetry grade fibers and rods of aluminum oxide. The success criterion for <b>this</b> <b>milestone</b> <b>was</b> the production of aluminum oxide rods and fibers that have a minimum measureable dose (MMD) of 100 mrem or less. <b>This</b> <b>milestone</b> <b>was</b> completed and the MMD for the rods was measured to be 1. 53 mrem. Based on the MMD, the ability of the sensor to measure {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr/{sup 90 }Y, and {sup 99 }Tc was evaluated. It was determined that the sensor can measure the release limit of these radionuclides (50 pCi/cm{sup 3 }) in 150 h, 200 h, and 54, 000 h, respectively. The monitor is adequate for measuring {sup 137 }Cs and {sup 90 }Sr/{sup 90 }Y but is unsuitable for measuring {sup 99 }Tc in soil. The second objective was to construct a prototype sensor (dosimeter and fiber optic channel). There were three success criteria for this milestone: (1) Perform measurements with the sensor for both gamma and beta radiation with a standard deviation of 10 % or less; (2) Demonstrate the ability of the sensor to discriminate between gamma and beta radiation; and (3) Obtain similar or relatable results for differing lengths of fiber optic cable. These <b>milestones</b> <b>were</b> met. The sensor was able to measure gamma radiation repeatedly with a standard deviation of 3. 15 % and beta radiation with a standard deviation of 2. 85 %. Data is presented that demonstrates that an end cap can be used to discriminate between beta plus gamma and gamma radiation. It is shown that some amount of attenuation occurs in longer fiber optic cables, but it is unclear if the attenuation is due to poor alignment of the dosimeter and the cable. This issue will be investigated further when more dosimeters are available so that the dosimeters can be permanently attached to the longer cables. The third objective was to identify a demonstration site. The success criterion for <b>this</b> <b>milestone</b> <b>was</b> to obtain a written agreement from a DOE site to host the demonstration of the monitor during the third phase. Because of uncertainties in funding of the second and third phases of this effort, a written agreement was not obtained. Instead, verbal agreements were reached with both Hanford and the Nevada Test Site. It is believed that the verbal agreements meet the intent of the objective. The final objective was to prepare the Draft Phase I Topical Report. The success criterion for <b>this</b> <b>milestone</b> <b>was</b> to have the report accepted by NETL.
