5|$|Given the book's {{fluid and}} {{changeable}} approach <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> and characters, a definitive, critically agreed-upon plot synopsis remains elusive (see Critical response and themes: Difficulties of plot summary below).

50|$|One major area of {{research}} is gender and development, One study, conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, looked at the relative productivity of plots of farm land controlled by men compared <b>to</b> <b>plots</b> controlled by women. They found {{that the majority of}} resources are devoted <b>to</b> <b>plots</b> controlled by men, but if resources were diverted <b>to</b> <b>plots</b> controlled by women productivity could increase by as much as 20%. In another study in Kenya, where women get almost no education, they determined that if women farmers were provided one year of primary education, maize production could increase by as much as 24%.|$|R
5|$|The Number One periscope was Tritons navigational periscope, {{and it had}} a {{built-in}} sextant developed by the Kollmorgen Optical Company that allowed navigators to observe celestial bodies in order to obtain an accurate star fix <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> the ship's course and position.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|Donizetti {{managed to}} {{retrieve}} the score of L'ange de Nisida from Joly's company and reworked it as La favorite (now more commonly known by its Italian title, La favorita) in September 1840 for a December premiere in Italy. To circumvent the Italian censors Donizetti agreed <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> modifications; La favorite is about a medieval King of Castile.|$|E

5|$|In 1836 a Cincinnati civil {{engineer}} (H. L. Barnum) was hired <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> the northern {{expansion of the}} town. This plan was again an attempt to use Jefferson's original. The plan {{was rejected by the}} town council and another plan from a local {{civil engineer}} (Edmund F. Lee) was accepted. At the time Cincinnati was the major town in the area and subsequent map makers used the Barnum map as their primary source. Consequently, most maps of Jeffersonville from 1837 to about 1852 are in error.|$|E

On the November 10 episode of Raw, Ziggler was brutally attacked by the returning Luke Harper. The following week, Harper was awarded a title match against Ziggler, which Harper won with assistance from The Authority, ending Ziggler's reign at 56 days.|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> linearly.|$|E

Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer.

30|$|From 2002 through 2006, 1, 217 {{vegetation}} plots were sampled by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program {{on public}} lands (often grazed) throughout the state of Nevada and neighboring areas for two purposes: (1) developing methods for mapping annual grasses from remotely sensed satellite imagery (Peterson 2005, 2007, 2008 b), and (2) describing the vegetation communities of Nevada (Peterson 2008 a), including consideration of biocrusts. For this study, these data (the NeVeg dataset) were limited <b>to</b> <b>plots</b> within the Great Basin ecoregion as defined by Bryce et al.

The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurement}} of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder {{that is used}} to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted <b>to</b> <b>plot</b> Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E
