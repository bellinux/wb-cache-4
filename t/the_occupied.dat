25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Occupy</b> <b>the</b> Hood {{movement}} is a nationwide grassroots {{movement in the}} United States that {{is an extension of}} Occupy Wall Street and of <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Movement generally. <b>The</b> movement started in response to how <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Wall Street movement was developing after its initial encampment in Zuccotti Park. <b>Occupy</b> <b>the</b> Hood seeks to represent the interests of oppressed people and to bring people of color into <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Movement. <b>The</b> movement has been especially active in its attempts to decolonize <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Movement. <b>Occupy</b> <b>the</b> Hood was created by Malik Rhasaan, from Jamaica, Queens. <b>Occupy</b> <b>the</b> hood chapters exist in the U.S. cities of Atlanta, Boston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York City, New York, and other major metropolitan cities.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the occupation troops directly commanded by Schröder, in June the Wehrmacht deployed {{the headquarters of the}} LXV Corps zbV to Belgrade to command four poorly-equipped occupation divisions, under the control of General der Artillerie Paul Bader. Three divisions were deployed in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory, and the fourth was deployed in the adjacent parts of the NDH. The three divisions had been transported to <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory between 7 and 24 May, and were initially tasked with guarding the key railway lines to Bulgaria and Greece. By late June, Bader's headquarters had been established in Belgrade, and the three divisions in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory were deployed with headquarters at Valjevo in the west, Topola roughly in the centre of the territory, and Niš in the south. The status of Bader's command was that Schröder could order him to undertake operations against rebels, but he could not otherwise act as Bader's superior.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Volksdeutsche of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories were an {{important}} part of the economies of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories, and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I.

The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units. In the Caucasus, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Despite widely varying {{treatment}} (some {{groups were}} actively targeted for genocide, {{while others were}} not), some died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality. According to extensive documentation (written and photographic) left by the Nazis, eyewitness testimony by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders and records of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> countries, most perished in death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories would report on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, Berger was {{appointed}} as Himmler's liaison {{officer with the}} Reichsminister for <b>the</b> <b>Occupied</b> Eastern Territories, Alfred Rosenberg. To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943, Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations in <b>the</b> <b>Occupied</b> Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities {{to be placed in}} SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS domination of the economy and population of the subjugated east. The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945. In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European {{children between the ages of}} 10 and 14, under the codename Heuaktion. On 14 June 1944, Rosenberg issued orders implementing Berger's idea.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Hungarian {{authorities}} began evacuating the Székelys {{settled in}} <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories since 1941 to Transdanubia. Several {{days after the}} Soviet Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka, including the local Volksdeutsche. With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army, some of the Volksdeutsche left the region while some others stayed, despite the situation.|$|E

5|$|Such was {{the extent}} of the Holocaust in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories {{that by the end of}} the war, nearly 85 per cent of the Jews that had been living in the Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav territories in April 1941 had been killed.

5000|$|Michael Kazin, {{writing for}} The New Republic, {{analyzed}} {{the composition of}} <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Wall Street movement. He argued that Occupy members are different from political activists of the late 19th century and early 20th century counterparts, citing contemporary rejection of violent methods as the main difference. Kazin described <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Wall Street anarchists as [...] "ultra-egalitarian, radically environmentalist, effortlessly multicultural and scrupulously non-violent", describing them as the [...] "cyber-clever progeny of Henry David Thoreau and Emma Goldman." [...] Social media has played {{a vital role in}} <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> movement and Kazin noted that instead of authoring essays or promoting feminism and free love, <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Wall Street anarchists stream videos and arrange flash mobs.|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{response to}} <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> {{movement has been}} the question ‘‘What does Occupy want?’’ What might we understand about this persistent questioning of <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> movement? How might we {{begin to think about}} <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> movement as resistance to the culture of Wall Street and politicians in recent decades? This article provides some thoughts on the conceptual and discursive relationships between the causes of the global financial crisis, including the neoliberal consensus on financial regulation, and some of the dynamics that have arisen in relation to <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> Wall Street movement. In particular, it suggests that Jacques Derrida’s analysis of the tradition of fraternity in modern concepts of democracy, and feminist ideas on ‘‘speaking for others’’ may assist with understanding the relational gender dynamics of this regulatory consensus, the masculinity of the financial industry and the derivatives trading rooms, and one way in which dominant discourses are gendering <b>the</b> <b>Occupy</b> movement...|$|R
