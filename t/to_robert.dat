5|$|Early in Becket's exile, Robert {{received}} a papal censure {{for not doing}} more to support Becket. In summer 1165, Robert accompanied Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, on a papal mission to King Henry, to convey to the king Pope Alexander's complaints about the king's behaviour. The king had been preventing his subjects from visiting or appealing to the papacy, and Alexander wished to protest against that, as well as against the king's treatment of Becket. In 1166, Becket tried to convince Robert to switch sides, writing <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> in conciliatory tones. John of Salisbury, a supporter of Becket's, prevailed upon two French academics to write <b>to</b> <b>Robert,</b> criticising him for hypocrisy.|$|E

However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program.

Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was {{translated}} to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V. Pope Martin delegated authority <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, {{in order to take}} Lichton's oath to the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese, a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s the house had been leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.|$|E

5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Chesney died in 1174, {{having had}} three daughters {{with his wife}} Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is {{possible}} that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, {{but it is not clear}} whether this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William. William and Gilla's daughters were Margaret, Clemence, and Sara, all of whom were unmarried at the time of their father's death. Margaret married twice– first to Hugh de Cressy and second <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> fitzRoger. Clemence married Jordan de Sackville, and Sara married Richard Engaine. Margaret inherited the majority of her father's estates.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's family {{originated}} from Quesnay-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy near Bayeux in France, {{but they had}} settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, {{and became one of}} Oxfordshire's leading landowners. Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of Evesham Abbey. Chesney's sister Agnes was married <b>to</b> <b>Robert</b> Foliot, steward to the Earl of Huntingdon. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney, it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.|$|E
