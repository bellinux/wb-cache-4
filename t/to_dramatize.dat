5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{theatrical}} agent Walter Jordan encouraged Elmer Rice <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> an unpublished {{novel by}} Hayden Talbot. At the time, Rice {{was best known}} for his 1914 Broadway play On Trial, which featured the first use of flashback, a narrative technique he adapted from film, in a Broadway production. Rice's adaptation of Talbot's work, It Is the Law, again featured a story told in flashback. It ran for 125 performances at the Ritz Theatre, and was a modest success.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5000|$|A good {{objective}} theory {{explains what}} occurs {{and why it}} happens. This theory gives a great explanation of what makes sense to a group discussion and how. It can help us make sense of a chaotic group discussion when group members speak {{at one time or}} go off on verbal tangents.However, Boston College communication professor James Olufowote doesn't believe Bormann's explanation goes far enough. In a sympathetic critique aimed at making the theory better, he contends that [...] "SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> reality and sharing fantasy in the first place.

50|$|Aspects of the HIV storyline {{have been}} criticized, {{specifically}} that little airtime was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> clinical procedures determining whether Jeanie {{had been exposed}} to HIV. When Jeanie discovered that her husband had AIDS in the second season finale, Jeanie has a blood test and sends it off for analysis to see if she also had the virus; however, viewers were not shown the multiple clinical procedures involved in the testing, and the following episodes concentrated on post-test rituals.|$|R
5|$|In 1963, Egyptian {{director}} Youssef Chahine {{produced the}} film El Nasser Salah El Dine ("Saladin The Victorious"), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered {{a hero in}} the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> {{the role of a}} modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world. He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the Netflix television series The Crown.|$|E
5|$|In September 1909, Glavis {{made his}} {{allegations}} public {{in a magazine}} article, disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service. This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for. On September 13, 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service, relying on a report from Attorney General George W. Wickersham dated two days previously. Pinchot was determined <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the issue by forcing his own dismissal, which Taft tried to avoid, fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt (still overseas). Taft asked Elihu Root (by then a senator) {{to look into the}} matter, and Root urged the firing of Pinchot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
50|$|Allégret devotes 16 {{minutes of}} the Travels in the Congo <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> the {{courtship}} and marriage customs of the Sara people. A fictional melodrama, concerning a young couple striving to win the approval of their respective families, introduces the audience to accurate sociological information of the courting culture of the Sara. The director personally managed all aspects of production of this segment, including the scouting of suitably scenic locations for filming and choosing the locals who portrayed the parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{impulse to}} {{incorporate}} historical material into literary texts {{has been an}} intermittent feature of literature in the west since its earliest days. Aristotle's theory of art {{is based on the}} use of putatively historical events and characters. Especially after the development of modern mass-produced literature, there have been genres that relied on history or then-current events for material. English Renaissance drama, for example, developed subgenres specifically devoted <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> recent murders and notorious cases of witchcraft.|$|R

5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny was memorialized {{most famously}} by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, {{although}} the French silent film La Révolution en Russe (Mutiny on a Man-of-War in Odessa or Revolution in Odessa, 1905), directed by Ferdinand Zecca or Lucien Nonguet (or both), {{was the first}} film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22, with the derelict battleship Dvenadsat Apostolov standing in for the broken-up Potemkin, Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.|$|E
25|$|Byrd, by then {{an internationally}} recognized, {{pioneering}} American polar explorer and aviator, served {{for a time}} as Honorary National President (1931–1935) of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in the social sciences.

5000|$|In 1921, Przybyszewska married Jan Panienski, {{an artist}} and fellow {{morphine}} addict whom she met in Kraków. Following his death from an overdose in 1924, Przybyszewska drifted into a solitary and fanatical obsession with the French Revolution, dating her letters (which she wrote to recipients as diverse as her father and Thomas Mann) by the French Republican Calendar. Desperately poor and, increasingly, mentally unstable, she spent {{the last years of}} her life living in a tiny, unheated garret in Danzig (now [...] ), painting her food with Lysol to preserve it and devoting herself <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> the Revolution.|$|R

25|$|In {{the real}} estate market, call options have long been used to {{assemble}} large parcels of land from separate owners; e.g., a developer pays {{for the right to}} buy several adjacent plots, but is not obligated to buy these plots and might not unless he can buy all the plots in the entire parcel. Film or theatrical producers often buy the right— but not the obligation— <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> a specific book or script.|$|E
25|$|While {{communism}} is {{not explicitly}} named, {{the film is}} also interpreted as a criticism of this ideology, {{as well as the}} lack of individual identity in a collective life under a communist society. However, the novel's criticisms were aimed at Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, and this is reflected in Rand's endorsement of modernism in architecture in both the book and the film. In adapting her novel, Rand utilized the melodrama genre <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the novel's sexuality and aesthetic of modernistic architecture.|$|E
50|$|The report {{inspired}} a controversial television miniseries, The Path <b>to</b> 9/11. <b>Dramatizing</b> many specific {{scenes in the}} report, it is a synthesis of multiple (and in some cases partisan) sources {{in addition to the}} report itself.|$|R
5000|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{refers to}} In the Land of Blood and Honey as [...] "a film of shuddering earnestness and fevered good {{intentions}} gone awry, a dreary slog {{of a message}} movie with little but noble if unfulfilled aspirations to commend it." [...] He continues by opining that [...] "Serbian groups have justifiably complained about Jolie’s glib stereotyping of Serbs as racist heavies" [...] before concluding that [...] "Jolie has, after disastrously received 2003 message movie Beyond Borders, once again succeeded in attracting international attention to international atrocities and its possible, if not particularly likely, that someday she will get around <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> atrocities compellingly as well".|$|R

25|$|He tended <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; he is {{more concerned}} with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so much more interested in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E
500|$|Other {{themes in}} The Portage include the {{philosophical}} and moral analysis of history, justice, guilt and revenge. Having captured {{one of the}} world's greatest enemies, his Jewish captors are forced to examine their feelings on the situation they find themselves in. Hitler's historical significance features prominently in the book, and the recurring questions surrounding the meaning of Hitler, which Steiner makes no attempt to answer, surface periodically. Norwegian literary scholar Jakob Lothe felt, however, that Steiner's attempts <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> these complex issues fail because his fiction [...] "is too poor" [...] {{for it to be}} effective.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{compared}} Most Wanted to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off Angel, {{saying the}} series {{would be more}} intimate than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. because {{at the heart of}} the series would be the question, [...] "What's the metaphor of the relationship that's going <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> over the course of the episode versus the larger machinations of the world that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] in?" [...] Palicki said the pilot is less based in Marvel mythology and more focused on the two characters, whose dynamic she compared to Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Blood added, [...] "It’s exploring how you make a relationship work with the backdrop of all this crazy stuff that goes on" [...] in their world.|$|E
50|$|XFL team {{names and}} logos {{sometimes}} appear {{in movies and}} television where professional football needs <b>to</b> be <b>dramatized,</b> as licensing for NFL logos may be cost prohibitive (such as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger starring sci-fi film The 6th Day).|$|R
40|$|The {{articles}} {{included in}} “Victorian Internationalisms” stress how attention to geopolitical contexts beyond {{those associated with}} imperialism can enrich {{our understanding of the}} Victorian engagement with the wider world. At the same time, they largely resist the temptation to recast Victorian cultural production within the often valorized rhetoric of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism. They reveal instead, for instance, the subtle ways in which national self-interest could overlap with humanitarian concerns or how British authors such as Oscar Wilde both welcomed and resisted the influence of French literature and culture. “Victorian Internationalisms” likewise draws renewed attention to the category of the “literary” itself as a discursive space perhaps uniquely suited <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> the complexities of geopolitical involvement...|$|R

500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E
500|$|Night of January 16th is a {{theatrical}} play by Russian-American author Ayn Rand, {{inspired by the}} death of the [...] "Match King", Ivar Kreuger. Set in a courtroom during a murder trial, an unusual feature of the play is that members of the audience are chosen to play the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose murder she is accused. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner's death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The play's ending depends on the verdict. Rand's intention was <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> a conflict between individualism and conformity, with the jury's verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred.|$|E
500|$|The {{depiction}} of the police attempting {{to shut down the}} filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. [...] According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day [...] "almost in real time", and that [...] "getting busted {{was an integral part of}} the plan." [...] Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order <b>to</b> <b>dramatize</b> the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio-recorded version of the song. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards.|$|E
40|$|If {{you look}} to reality TV or themany {{television}} hospital dramasto gauge how our society views doctors today, you’re following a time-worn tradition. In fact, the 400 -year-old extravagant and excessive art form of opera predates TV when it comes <b>to</b> <b>dramatizing</b> our culture’s perceptions of the medical profession — and not all those perceptions are positive. As science and medicine changed over the centuries, so too did Western society’s idea of doctors as “professionals. ” A quick review of the operatic canon of-fers 3 basic views of the physician. The pompous pedant: In representations of doctors in operatic stories set before the 19 th century, the physician is most often presented as arrogant, foolish and inept, from Mozart’s fake mesmerist in Così fan tutte (1790), to the quack Dr. Dulcamara in Donizetti’s Elisir d’amore (1832) {{and on to the}} Bologna-traine...|$|R
