5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form the basis for a variety of popular histories, suggested that <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, Lieutenant William Broughton, a British explorer, led {{the first}} trip by non-natives as far up the Columbia River as {{the mouth of}} the Sandy River. He and his men camped on Sauvie Island, which lies between the Willamette and Columbia rivers {{directly}} opposite {{the mouth of the}} slough. Broughton encountered many Chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including Hayden Island and other islands in the Columbia just north of the slough. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800people living in 11villages. <b>The</b> <b>explorers</b> estimated that 800people of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookans lived in five villages on Sauvie Island.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. <b>The</b> <b>explorers</b> named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

The ship's route led {{first to}} the South Atlantic, then through the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the islands of Polynesia and finally around Cape Horn back to England, returning on July 30, 1775. During the three-year journey, <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> visited New Zealand, the Tonga islands, New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands and Easter Island. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering Antarctica. The journey conclusively disproved the Terra Australis Incognita theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.|$|E
5|$|An earlier fleet {{had been}} the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa. That {{expedition}} had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was {{under the control of the}} Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> was the search for the mythical Prester John—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's spice trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{traveled}} {{thousands of}} miles across central North America {{in an attempt to}} map and explore the Louisiana Territory of the United States and the Oregon Country, which were then occupied mainly by Native Americans and settlers from Great Britain. As the expedition traveled down and back up the Columbia River, it missed the mouth of the Willamette, one of the Columbia's largest tributaries. It was only after receiving directions from natives along the Sandy River that <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> learned about their oversight. William Clark returned down the Columbia and entered the Willamette River in April 1806. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Willamette Valley in 1841 while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail. The expedition members noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, much like that at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River.|$|E

He {{was a member of the}} board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film always took priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is also credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama film projection process. Cooper's most famous film was the 1933 movie King Kong. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux {{was known}} as a {{mathematician}} and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses.

He also knew <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made {{in such a way that}} they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} eruptions at Mount Hood {{occurred}} {{within the past}} 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily {{to the south and}} west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.|$|E

5000|$|Alongside <b>the</b> five-door Ford <b>Explorer,</b> Ford re-introduced <b>the</b> Bronco II with a three-door {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Explorer</b> for 1991. <b>The</b> three-door was sold under <b>the</b> <b>Explorer</b> and Explorer Sport names. To address the {{stability}} {{problems of the}} Bronco II, <b>the</b> three-door <b>Explorer</b> had an 8-inch longer wheelbase and was nearly a full foot longer in length. In contrast to the unique roofline of the Bronco II, <b>the</b> three-door <b>Explorer</b> wore a similar roofline to the five-door, with a raked [...] "C-pillar" [...] as an identifying feature.

Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when <b>the</b> <b>explorers</b> landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E
