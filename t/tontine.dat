On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for {{residents}} and visitors. Assembly rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a <b>Tontine</b> and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time.|$|E
5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a <b>Tontine,</b> an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E

50|$|Louis XIV {{first made}} use of <b>tontines</b> in 1689 to fund {{military}} operations when he could not otherwise raise the money. The initial subscribers each put in 300 livres, and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 {{at the age of}} 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment. The English government first issued <b>tontines</b> in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the Nine Years' War.|$|R
5|$|The Theatre Royal {{was built}} to replace the Old Orchard Street Theatre, funded by a <b>Tontine</b> and elaborately decorated. The {{architect}} was George Dance the Younger, with John Palmer carrying out much of the work. It opened with a performance of Shakespeare's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. A major fire in 1862 destroyed {{the interior of the}} building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps, which included the construction of the current entrance. Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892; more extensive building work, including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting, followed in 1902. Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt, the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the theatre was rarely very profitable. During World War II Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared, with shows including Noël Coward's Private Lives and Blyth Spirit, a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as Charley's Aunt, but audiences declined.|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{was erected}} in 1805, {{replacing}} the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling {{the use of}} the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London. The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall. The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a <b>Tontine,</b> an investment plan named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combined features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an annuity. As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent who later became George IV and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers. A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms.|$|E
25|$|Hazard had {{previously}} invested in {{an idea of}} Blodget's called the Boston <b>Tontine,</b> a sort of early annuity fund that also acted as a lottery for the last surviving investor. It failed, but Blodget and Hazard decided to try again in Philadelphia, then the largest city in North America. They called their new attempt the Universal <b>Tontine</b> Association and this time gave it a 21-year lifespan, after which the association would disband and the surviving investors would split {{what remained of the}} fund.|$|E
50|$|While once {{very popular}} in France, Britain, and the United States, <b>tontines</b> have been banned in Britain, {{pursuant}} to the British Life Assurance Act 1774, 14 Geo. 3, c. 48, and as amended, and in the United States. See, e.g., Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S. 775, 779 (1881). Such financial instruments are illegal primarily because they create beneficiaries who {{have an interest in}} the reduced lifespan of another person, and because many of these schemes were little more than swindles that encourage mischief against the life of the insured. Geneva, in Switzerland, was known for its active market in <b>tontines</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries. The First Life Directive of the European Union specified <b>tontines</b> as a class of insurance business to be underwritten by authorised and regulated companies, but that part of the regulations was not enacted in the United Kingdom.|$|R

25|$|The Universal <b>Tontine</b> Association {{also failed}} to {{generate}} the hoped-for interest. In November 1792, its investors met at the Pennsylvania State House (today Independence Hall) {{to decide what to}} do with their fund. On November 12, they adopted a proposal to form a general insurance company, to be called the Insurance Company of North America. On November 19, the investors adopted articles of association, giving the company the ability to write fire, life, or marine insurance, though initially the investors would focus solely on marine.|$|E

After sending a delegation to Philadelphia to observe the organization of their board of brokers, restrictions on manipulative trading were adopted as well as formal organs of governance. After re-forming as the New York Stock and Exchange Board the broker organization began renting out space exclusively for securities trading, which previously had been taking place at the <b>Tontine</b> Coffee House. Several locations were used between 1817 and 1865, when the present location was adopted.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the money}} needed was raised {{from the sale of}} shares at £100 each (approximately £ in [...] ) in two <b>tontine</b> schemes, the first for £20,000 and the second for £5,000. The first was {{appropriately}} called the Richmond-Bridge <b>Tontine,</b> but {{when it became clear that}} the initial £20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second <b>tontine</b> was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so £1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two tontines. On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend. Any revenue over the £1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge.|$|E

40|$|A “tontine ” is {{a special}} kind of annuity in which all {{participants}} contribute equally to a subscrip-tion pool, and a fixed percent of the total capital raised is distributed equally among surviving nomi-nees every year. In this paper, we examine the adverse selection in the Irish <b>tontines</b> of 1773, 1775 and 1777 {{because of the presence of}} a group of speculative investors, namely a group of Genevan bankers. These Genevan investors purportedly cherry-picked nominees with greater expected longevity. Their existence allows us to study a rather unconventional aspect of adverse selection, which arises from the informational asymmetry among different types of buyers. Using a newly compiled data set on the nominees and their subsequent mortality, we estimate that these Genevan investors earned on average 8. 5 % more per share than the other subscribers of the Irish <b>tontines.</b> The result suggests that speculative investors with access to superior information may earn higher returns at the expense of average investors, a phenomenon implicit but difficult to quantify in other insurance markets.
