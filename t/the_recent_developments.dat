500|$|Part V of the Act, {{sections}} 28 to 33, {{deals with}} trustees' remuneration. Section 28 states the default {{position is that}} trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a [...] "professional capacity". A trust can differ from this default, but the Act confirms <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>developments</b> in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were. Section 29 {{goes on to say}} that non-charitable professional trustees are entitled to [...] "reasonable remuneration" [...] which will be a sum that the court thinks is commensurate to the work done, along the principles of quantum meruit. This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation, but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are natural persons. Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State. Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself, as will be authorised agents, nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust.|$|E
