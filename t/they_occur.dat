5|$|Hindu mythology {{contains}} numerous incidents where sexual interactions serve a non-sexual, sacred purpose; in some cases, {{these are}} same-sex interactions. Sometimes the gods condemn these interactions but {{at other times}} <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> with their blessing.|$|E
5|$|In bays where <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> in {{very high}} numbers, {{predation}} by ctenophores may control {{the populations of}} small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are {{a vital part of}} marine food chains.|$|E
50|$|The {{cash flows}} {{used in the}} formula are {{weighted}} based on the time <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> in the period. For example, if <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> {{in the beginning of}} the month they would have a higher weight than if <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> at the end of the month. This is different from the simple Dietz method, in which the cash flows are weighted equally regardless of when <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> during the measurement period, which works on an assumption that the flows are distributed evenly throughout the period.|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California. In spring and summer, <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime. In the Northeast, storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida.|$|E

5|$|A decidated {{group of}} eclipse chasers have pursued the {{observation}} of solar eclipses when <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> around the Earth. A person who chases eclipses is known as an umbraphile, meaning shadow lover. Umbraphiles travel for eclipses and use various tools to help view the sun including solar viewing glasses, also known as eclipse glasses, as well as telescopes.|$|E

5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> almost only when sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|As cases {{cannot be}} stacked in Wagiman, these number suffixes cannot be called case suffixes, whereas the nominal suffixes {{discussed}} above (such as -binyju 'only'), {{show the same}} syntactic distribution - <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> {{in the same place}} - and therefore may be analysed as cases themselves.|$|E

5|$|Central Pacific hurricanes {{are rare}} and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move {{in this area}} annually. As there are no large {{contiguous}} landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g.

5|$|Many of {{the smaller}} insectivorous birds {{including}} the warblers, hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at night.

5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E
5|$|Seizure {{prediction}} {{refers to}} attempts to forecast epileptic seizures {{based on the}} EEG before <b>they</b> <b>occur.</b> As of 2011, no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed.

5|$|Seizures {{may also}} {{occur as a}} {{consequence}} of other health problems; if <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
