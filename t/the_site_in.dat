5|$|A Carmelite priory {{was founded}} in 1354, but was {{demolished}} soon after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538.

30|$|The Employment Retention and Advancement {{demonstration}} {{differs from}} the other two examples in that somewhat different treatments were implemented across <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> that study, while <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jobstart demonstration all implemented the same basic model and <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National JTPA study all implemented the JTPA program with some variation.|$|R

5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E

In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
30|$|Importantly, similar survey {{protocols}} {{have been}} employed across our various studies and experiments.

5|$|American {{explorer}} John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood visited <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> 1840, {{at which}} {{time it was a}} confused jumble of overgrown ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.|$|E
5|$|Another serious fire {{occurred}} on 17 October 1958, when Selwood's tannery in Exeter Street was gutted by fire; {{the site was}} subsequently used {{by a series of}} supermarkets.

5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} known of the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals.

The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the REO bid to develop <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> <b>in</b> February 2012, Battersea Power Station was put up for sale on the open market {{for the first time in}} its history. The sale was {{conducted}} by commercial estate agent Knight Frank on behalf of the site's creditors. In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings' Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London & Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley. If sold, the new owner would have to pay £500 million for the power station, including £325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds, and a £100 million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale is unsuccessful, the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> line with its listed status.|$|E
