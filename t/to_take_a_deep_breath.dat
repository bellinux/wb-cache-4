500|$|The iPad 2 {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera. Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that [...] "for {{those of you}} who haven't yet made the leap, feel free <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and dive in – the iPad 2 is {{as good as it gets}} right now.

60|$|The car moved on, {{gathered}} speed, vanished round a curve, and Doris {{was left}} {{standing by the}} sign-post at the cross-roads, still dizzy and weak with the languor born of those kisses and the electrical touch of those gentle hands. She had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> to draw herself up deliberately, before she {{was strong enough to}} start her homeward walk. She had half a mile in which to invent the necessary lies.|$|E
60|$|Anderson paused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Then {{he began}} to curse Neuman. All the rough years of his {{frontier}} life, {{as well as the}} quieter ones of his ranching days, found expression in the swift, thunderous roll of his terrible scorn. Every vile name that had ever been used by cowboy, outlaw, gambler, leaped to Anderson's stinging tongue. All the keen, hard epithets common to the modern day he flung into Neuman's face. And he ended with a profanity that was as individual in character as its delivery was intense.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, {{children}} were often diagnosed as suffering from psychosis like schizophrenia, but instead were said to suffer from [...] "pubescent" [...] or [...] "developmental" [...] insanity.

He {{has more than one}} side to him. I am sick of the slang of the Rialto and the greenroom. I'm tired of cheap witticisms and of gossip. With Mr. Douglass I can discuss calmly and rationally many {{questions}} which trouble me. He helps me. To talk with him enables me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and try again. He enables me to forget the stage for a few hours." ...|$|E
5000|$|Supraglottic swallow - The {{patient is}} asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and hold their breath.

This technique can be used when there is reduced or late vocal fold closure or there is a delayed pharyngeal swallow.|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Emma-Lee Potter of The Daily Express {{called the}} novel [...] "a fast-moving roller-coaster of a read" [...] and Laura Wilson of The Guardian said [...] "Barclay succeeds in both banging the gong and serving up a riveting, rewarding and, {{for the most}} part, plausible three courses, though you may need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> somewhere around the coffee stage." ...|$|E

It is also able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> or wider cut with less coolant, as the chip clearance on the wheel is greater.|$|R
6000|$|Possibly, in some sense, Clifford {{may have}} been right. He needed a shock; or perhaps he {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> deep plunge into the ocean of human life, and to sink down and be covered by its profoundness, and then to emerge, sobered, invigorated, restored {{to the world and}} to himself. Perhaps again, he required nothing less than the great final remedy--death! ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011 Arturo Gatti’s {{murder case}} was {{reviewed}} and discussed at Global Boxing Gym, which housed the official press {{conference of the}} investigation. Later that year 48 Hours Mystery TV mystery used {{the results of the}} investigation press conference <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look into Gatti’s case.

50|$|He {{defined it}} {{as a kind}} of mystical {{illumination}} by which was obtained a belief in God that could not be reached by mere intellectual effort. He carried this tendency to mysticism into his physical researches, and was led by it <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the phenomena of animal magnetism. He ultimately became a devout believer in demoniacal and spiritual possession; and his later writings are all strongly impregnated with supernaturalism.|$|R
50|$|As {{deliberately}} paced as a late-afternoon amble {{around a}} homestead, the movie occasionally stops {{in its tracks}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and soak in more of the rural atmosphere. Although this tendency to dawdle may frustrate viewers accustomed to a barrage of visual stimulation, the movie's unhurried rhythm eventually works a quiet spell, {{and after a while}} you find yourself settling back, adjusting to the film's bucolic metabolism and appreciating its eye and ear for detail.|$|E
5000|$|Bowman {{follows a}} broad range of bioethical issues, {{including}} end-of-life decision making, ethical questions in emerging technology, such as genomics, gene drive and CRISPR-Cas9, cloning and reproductive ethics. He is also concerned with a variety of animal and environmental ethical questions, particularly de-extinction. “The science is moving much faster than the ethics,” he remarked. “We’ve got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> because we’re about to alter the human genetic code in a way that it’s never been altered before.” ...|$|E
50|$|San Carlos Cave {{is one of}} {{the toughest}} cave in the country to conquer as spelunkers require a lot of cave crawling. A chamber called Ice Cream Parlor {{contains}} cluster of white stalagmites that resemble scooped ice cream. The John the Baptist chamber has a sump where one has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and swim {{to the other side of}} the chamber. Sharp and rough stones could scratch skin and tear clothing. San Carlos requires a lot of swimming because more than half the cave is covered by cold running subterranean river.|$|E

50|$|Mercedes and {{her daughters}} moved to the Argentine {{province}} of Neuquén. In search {{of a way to}} finance her daughters' education, Mercedes <b>took</b> <b>a</b> job in the Quilquihué Hostel. The owner of the hostel, Manuel Mora, propositioned Mercedes, promising to pay for Laura's education in exchange. Laura soon entered the Hijas de Maria Auxiliadora (“Daughters of Mary Help of Christians”) School, where, under the care of the nuns, she began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the Catholic faith.|$|R
5000|$|Lambert {{said that}} the song is [...] "about slowing down, taking a breath and remembering what it's like to live life a little more simply. It's not about going back, but reminiscing {{about what it was}} like to hang laundry on the line and wait for it to dry and my dad {{teaching}} me how to drive my '55 Chevy that I still have but don't drive nearly enough. The song brings back good memories and it reminds me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and to remember that getting there is half the fun." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{technician}} {{places a}} catheter into {{the nose and}} then guides it into the stomach. Once placed in the stomach lining, the catheter is slowly withdrawn, allowing it to detect pressure changes and to record information for later review. The patient will be asked at times <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> or to take some swallows of water. The degree of discomfort varies among patients. Patients are not sedated because sedatives would alter {{the functioning of the}} esophageal muscles. Overall the procedure takes about 45 minutes. After the procedure is complete, patients can usually resume their normal daily activities.|$|E
5000|$|On July 2, 2014, Jurrjens {{was traded}} to the Colorado Rockies in {{exchange}} for minor league first baseman Harold Riggins. Jurrjens made his 2014 season debut on July 4, making his first major league start since June 29, 2013, pitching [...] innings and allowing eight runs on 12 hits. After the start, Jurrjens was taken to the hospital, though his [...] "breathing problem" [...] had since ceased. He said [...] "It was super scary. Every time I needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> I couldn't do it." [...] Rockies manager Walt Weiss said the altitude may have affected Jurrjens in his first appearance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bill Donohue of the Catholic League <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more {{sympathetic}} tack regarding the issue: [...] "It’s time for everyone <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath," [...] he commented. [...] "I {{have never met}} President Gee, {{but it is clear}} from what I read that what he said was made in jest. Was it dumb? ... yes.

Political correctness has gone too far." ...|$|R
30|$|Having {{looked at}} the way the first Mobility Partnerships were {{elaborated}} and with the objective to interrogate how the guiding principles on migration management of the Global Approach to Migration are diffused through this instrument, we now propose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look at the implementation of the initiatives falling under this framework of cooperation. Through the interviews conducted with the relevant actors, along with the examination of the “scoreboards” detailing the projects for each partner country, we observe an unequal repartition of the efforts through the pillar structure of the Mobility Partnerships.|$|R
5000|$|Jason {{is taken}} down, and House reenters {{the room to}} find Thirteen still alive. When he asks her why she's alive, she responds, [...] "he didn't make me take it." [...] Outside, as Jason is arrested, House signals him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and let it out, and as {{he is able to}} do it, the {{diagnosis}} of Melioidosis is confirmed. According to House, the disease was easy to miss on various tests, and the fact that Jason never mentioned his trip to Florida prevented the diagnosis earlier. After nearly dying, Thirteen asks Foreman to admit her in to a clinical trial for Huntington's.|$|E
50|$|An initial {{spirometry}} {{is performed}} {{to assess the}} patient's native respiratory status. You will be asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and then blow into the mouthpiece of the spirometer {{as hard as you}} can. This is a baseline measurement. A dose of bronchodilator medication is administered by means of inhaler or nebulizer (such as 400mcg of salbutamol (also known as albuterol)). You will wait about 15 minutes and then the spirometry is repeated. An increase in FEV1 (or forced expiratory volume in the first second of a forced exhalation) of >200ml is considered a positive result. Bear in mind, however, that this number does not apply to children, and that it can differ depending on the patient's native result; small patient's with pulmonary fibrosis, restrictive lung disease etc. will have a percentually lower FEV1 than healthy average-sized adults. This can give a false positive result of the test.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the molding}} of inanimate objects, lifecasting poses some {{specific}} challenges and risks. Since the mold is made {{directly on the}} skin of the model, for safety and health reasons the molding materials must be non-toxic. The mold must not heat up too much or else discomfort and even severe burns could occur. The molding process must also be completed within a relatively short time frame, usually a half-hour or less, since people have limited endurance in holding a stationary pose. Methods to allow the model to continue breathing must also be used when a mold covers the mouth and nostrils. (Generally the nostrils are kept clear, but not with straws.) If the model is captured with lungs deflated it will be impossible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> To prevent injury or trapping the model in the mold, the shape and position of the mold must be well planned prior to application.|$|E
