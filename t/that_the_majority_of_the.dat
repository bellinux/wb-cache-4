This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately {{through the center of the}} lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Seas Fleet be interned in the British {{naval base}} in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive {{flotilla}} of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony {{but there is no}} significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, before {{proceeding}} to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface composition of Vesta {{is consistent with the}} composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{surgeons}} recommended {{an eight-hour}} procedure {{to remove the}} tumours; however, their size and proximity to his voice box eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumours had disappeared, and the final tumour's disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response.

5|$|On 31 October 1918, {{at the end}} of World War I and the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, the majority of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities supported by armed forces. The interim agreement of 2 November 1918 reflected the inability of the two national councils to come to final delimitation. On 5 November 1918, the area was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia by an interim agreement of two local self-government councils (Czech ZemskÃ½ nÃ¡rodnÃ­ vÃ½bor pro Slezsko and Polish Rada Narodowa KsiÄ™stwa CieszyÅ„skiego). Before <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area was taken over by Polish local authorities. In 1919 both councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw. The former was not satisfied with this compromise and on 23 January 1919 invaded the area while Poland was engaged in its war against the West Ukrainian National Republic.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{announced}} {{the arrest of}} 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, {{on a variety of}} drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E
5|$|The R-5 Pyramid {{is largely}} {{believed}} to by K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I's tomb, based mostly on evidence from Panel 4, crafted by Itzam K'an Ahk I, which records the new ajaw either dedicating or ceremonially re-opening {{the tomb of}} K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. The panel itself explicitly names the R-5 pyramid as the muk, or burial, of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I. However, despite intense efforts, no burial has ever {{been found in the}} pyramid, although the search was complicated byâ€”and eventually abandoned because ofâ€”rubble fill left behind by looters. It is probable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid was constructed within the years following the death of K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I, likely under Itzam K'an Ahk I's patronage. Itzam K'an Ahk I later erected six stelae at the base of this pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mont Blanc in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard {{initiated}} {{the sport of}} alpine mountaineering, and {{it was during the}} golden age of alpinism (185465) and the silver age of alpinism (186582) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main summits of the massif were first attained. Members of the England-based Alpine Club were instrumental in many of the first ascents, usually accompanied by guides from the towns of Chamonix or Courmayeur, such as Michel Croz, Michel Payot and Ã‰mile Rey, as well as the Swiss guide, Christian Almer. Across the massif there are now more than two thousand different mountaineering routes to the summits, ranging greatly in both length and difficulty. These attract climbers {{from all over the world}} who, unlike the early ascensionists, now have access to numerous climbing guidebooks, modern safety equipment, good information on climbing routes and technical difficulty, as well as weather forecasts and mountain accommodation and food.|$|E
