5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> normal blood test <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{opened the}} conference with {{an account of}} the anti-Jewish {{measures}} taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews had emigrated. This information was <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> briefing paper prepared for him the previous week by Eichmann.|$|E

5|$|Most chorale texts {{were written}} in the 16th and 17th century, by authors of the Reformation such as Martin Luther, Martin Schalling and Michael Weiße, and by hymn writers {{including}} Paul Gerhardt and Johann Heermann.

5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lower height.|$|E

The Canadian government also charged a royalty of between 10 and 20 percent on the value of gold <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> claim.|$|E

5|$|The first {{match was}} between Eddie Guerrero and Luther Reigns. In the early stages, both {{competitors}} took the advantage over one another.

5|$|The {{original}} pamphlet A Tryal of Witches, <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> contemporary {{report of}} the proceedings, erroneously dates the trial as March 1664, both {{on the front page}} and introduction. Original documents in the Public Record Office and other contemporary records clearly states it took place in the 14th year of the reign of Charles II (30 January 1662 to 29 January 1663).|$|E
5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E

5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|El Greco {{was born}} in Crete, which {{was at that time}} part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that {{tradition}} before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Frazier, however, {{searches}} the bank's records and finds that {{safe deposit box}} #392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him. White confronts Case who admits that the box contained diamonds and a ring that he had <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman's {{interest}} in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated {{by many of}} his lyrics. Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals {{given to him by}} his father, including some <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy's {{interest in}} medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht.|$|E
