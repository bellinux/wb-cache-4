Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E

5|$|The German {{military}} had pioneered using airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed {{by the success}} of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, {{as well as a number}} of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. When <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> be used by the airborne forces was under development, War Office officials decided that gliders would be an integral component, to transport troops and heavy equipment.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had not developed, {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation Peppermint {{was never}} put into effect.

By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough.

After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E
5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, £400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock.

The second phase of restoration included fitting <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E

5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, he {{remained}} at his alma mater, Minnesota, for one season {{as an assistant}} coach in 1914. Tulane University selected Shaughnessy as head football coach in 1915 over potential candidates Dana X. Bible and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame assistant coach Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unable to travel to New Orleans for an interview, and Tulane officials required a face-to-face meeting with the applicants. The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ adjusted for inflation) to be its football, basketball, and track coach, and athletic director. When he arrived, he found the football field in a state of disrepair and <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> be woefully inadequate. Because the athletic department was in dire financial straits, Shaughnessy paid to purchase new equipment for the team. With only one opponent scheduled in the upcoming season, he wrote letters to sixty schools to secure additional games.|$|E

He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E

5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|The main site, {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the roofs of the warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E

5|$|The British {{airborne}} establishment {{was formed}} in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{in response to the}} German use of airborne forces during the Battle of France. When <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> be used by the airborne forces was being developed, it had been decided by officials at the War Office that gliders would be an integral component of such a force; these would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment, which by 1941 had been expanded to include artillery and some form of tank. By the beginning of 1941, the War Office had issued four specifications for military gliders to be used by the airborne forces. The first was Air Ministry specification X.10/40, which called for an eight-seater glider similar to the German DFS 230, which eventually became the General Aircraft Hotspur I; the second was specification X.25/40 which became the Slingsby Hengist, a fifteen-seat glider; the third was specification X.26/40, the 25-seater Airspeed Horsa; and the last, X.27/40 was for a glider that could carry a light tank or other heavy loads. The number of aeronautical firms able to design and produce gliders was limited, especially since several were already committed to producing other prop-driven aircraft for the government; as such, contracts for the gliders were allocated to firms as the government saw fit, rather than through any competitive process. Slingsby was chosen to develop X.25/40 because it was believed to be too small to build larger gliders, and Airspeed would eventually build the Horsa. Because it had already developed the Hotspur, which first flew in November 1940, and was considered to have a sufficiently developed production capacity capable of producing a larger glider, General Aircraft Limited were chosen to develop X.27/40.|$|E
