5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical diagnostics, and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred a very long <b>time</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.|$|E
5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building {{has never had}} a second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode, leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E

The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries but what was seen as costing too much.|$|E

[...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead.

Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man".

[...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere".
