5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E

25|$|Despite another minor {{uprising}} led by General Ferrera in 1925, Paz Barahona's administration was, by Honduran standards, rather tranquil. The banana companies {{continued to}} expand, the government's budgetary situation improved, {{and there was}} even an increase in labor organizing. On the international front, the Honduran government, after years of negotiations, finally concluded {{an agreement with the}} British bondholders to liquidate most of the immense national debt. The bonds were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> at 20 percent of face value over a thirty-year period. Back interest was forgiven, and new interest accrued only over the last fifteen years of this arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement, Honduras, at last, seemed on the road to fiscal solvency.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50 {{million in the}} form of Demand Notes, which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act of 1862, issuing United States Notes, which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were legal tender, meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through Gresham's Law. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in Hepburn v. Griswold that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the Legal Tender Cases. In 1875, Congress passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the other}} poems {{making up the}} Four Quartets, Little Gidding deals with the past, present, and future, and humanity's place within them as each {{generation}} is seemingly united. In the second section, there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets, including Dante, Swift, Yeats, and others. When the ghost joins the poet, the narrator states [...] "Knowing myself yet being someone other". This suggests that the different times merge {{at the same time}} that the different personalities begin to merge, allowing a communication and connection with the dead. Later, in the fourth section, humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London; redemption or destruction. God's love allows humankind <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> and escape the living hell through purgation by fire. The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet. He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society.|$|E
500|$|According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Gautama curses Indra {{to bear a}} {{thousand}} vulvae, which will turn to eyes when he worships the sun-god Surya. Ahalya, though innocent, is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> only by Rama's touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same Purana, Gautama catches Indra fleeing as a cat and curses him with castration. Ahalya's plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the [...] "vow of chastity and fidelity", but another man's seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders {{her to go to}} the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama's feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama's feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they spend their days in bed, exploring sexual techniques.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and writer}} Jacquetta May, {{who played the}} {{character}} Rachel Kominski between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline {{and the role of}} women in an article about EastEnders. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, [...] "a key figure of the community", was shown to exhibit such [...] "pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice". In order for Peggy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed,</b> she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, [...] "Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although EastEnders endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the postwar}} years, the heavy {{production}} of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased {{and some of}} the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. [...] Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. [...] Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded for a decade or more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> and melted.|$|E
500|$|After TGS 2014, where Episode Duscae {{was first}} announced, Tabata {{and the team}} {{adjusted}} the gameplay experience based on fan feedback. The original plan was for a large area of the worldmap that players could explore using the car. While the ability to drive the party's car was originally included, it was later cut as Tabata feared that the feature would be too new for older fans of the series, who might have mistaken XV for [...] "a driving game". The team decided {{to focus on the}} characters and environment. The demo included English and Japanese audio for all regions. The demo released in all regions alongside the physical and digital releases of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. The physical version was exclusive to day-one editions of Type-0 HD, while the digital version was valid for two months after purchase. The code had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> within one year of purchase. While players could save their progress in the demo, save data could not be carried over to the main game. Despite this, the team announced its intention to create a bonus for those who purchased the demo. A patch titled Episode Duscae 2.0 was released in June 2015, which included enhancements for the camera and controls, fixes for bugs, and adjustments to gameplay. The demo ran on Version 1.5 of Luminous Studio.|$|E
500|$|On 22 October, Whitlam {{had asked}} the Attorney-General, Kep Enderby, to have a paper drafted rebutting the Ellicott opinion for {{presentation}} to Kerr. Enderby delegated this task to the Solicitor-General, Maurice Byers, and other officials. On 6 November, Enderby was to see Kerr {{to give him a}} legal opinion regarding the Government's alternative plans in case supply ran out. Vouchers were to be issued to Commonwealth employees and contractors instead of cheques, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> from banks after the crisis ended—transactions which were to be rejected by major banks as [...] "tainted with illegality". Enderby decided to present Kerr with the rebuttal to Ellicott. When Enderby reviewed the document, he found that, while it argued for the Government's position, it recognised both that the Senate had the constitutional right to block supply, and that the reserve powers were still extant—matters with which Enderby did not agree. He presented Kerr with the rebuttal, but crossed out Byers' signature on it and told Kerr of his disagreement. Enderby told Kerr that the Byers rebuttal was [...] "background" [...] for formal written advice, to be presented by Whitlam. Later that day, Kerr met with Fraser again. The Opposition leader told him that if Kerr did not dismiss Whitlam, the Opposition planned to criticise him in Parliament for failing to carry out his duty.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict and we need to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior and we need to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ is man able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed.</b>|$|E
500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as {{the lives of the people}} on the receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E

The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more [...] "honorable" [...] witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds" [...] (I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti), Jiminy Cricket is deeply enamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good, but the Queen refuses <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>redeemed</b> and orders her soldiers to steal the throne the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old woman. Eventually, the Queen is defeated by another witch Tardona and Snow White is saved. [...] "Snow White and the Chained Fairy" [...] (I Sette Nani e la fata incatenata), sees the dwarfs struggle to free the fairy Fawn who was captured by the Queen in an underground cavern for saving Snow White when Grimhilde flew to strike down the princess with a thunderbolt. She takes on many forms trying to thwart them in various ways, and one-by-one the dwarfs sacrifice their lives, until only Dopey remains but he manages to get hold of magical water that brings back all of them to life. The freed fairy's magic makes the cavern collapse down on the helpless Queen to make sure she will never hurt anyone again. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Birtch Ring" [...] (I Sette Nani e l'anello di betulla by Romano Scarpa), the Queen learns about the eight Dwarf named Ginger (Zenzero), who has left the his companions to go in search of fortune traveling the world, and transforms into a pixie named Fagottina to send him home and sow discord among his brothers. The Queen also transforms into a pixie, named Fogliolina, in [...] "Snow White and Easter in the Woods" [...] (Biancaneve e la Pasqua nel bosco), where, after her attempt to kill Snow White with magic is foiled by woodland creatures, she is so enraged that she calls upon the infernal powers to [...] "take her" [...] and her castle burns into flames and crumbles [...] around her.
