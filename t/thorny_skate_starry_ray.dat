40|$|The {{occurrence}} of skates (Rajidae) in the by-catch of trawl and long-line fisheries in the Barents Sea are described. The dominant species captured were <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> or <b>starry</b> <b>ray</b> (Amblyraja radi-ate), arctic skate (A. hyperborea) and round skate (Rajella fyllae), whereas blue or big skate (Dipturus batis) and sail ray (D. linteus) were only caught occasionally. Information {{on the size}} distribution and sex ratio are provided. Larger skates were more often caught in long-line fisheries, with the mean and maximum length of fish greater in long-line catches, particularly for the larger-bodied species. Ratio of males to females was close to 1 : 1 in all species except for arctic skate where males dominated in the long-line fishery. Preliminary estimates of skate by-catch in these fisheries indicate that total annual by-catch of skate in the Barents Sea ranges from 723 – 1 891 tons. <b>Thorny</b> <b>skate</b> accounted for 90 – 95 % of the total skate catch...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of justifying the use of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> in the technology of minced meat canned products of special purpose. The key criterion determined the specialized purpose of canned food is the high content of physiologically functional food ingredient of chondroitin sulfate in the cartilage of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> wings. The high content of chondroitin sulfate in raw materials ensures that the content of the physiologically functional ingredient in the finished canned food will be at the level from 220 to 250 mg per 100 g of product. The method of IR blanching is presented for removing urea from the <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> muscle tissue. To confirm the efficiency of the developed method of urea removal, it has been proposed to use a modified photocolorimetric method for determination of mass fractions of urea in feed flour according to the governmental standard GOST R 50032 – 92 "Feed flour made of fish, marine mammals, crustaceans and invertebrates. Methods of determining the mass fraction of urea and calculation of the crude protein with a given mass fraction of carbamide". With the help of this technique, the efficiency of urea removal from the <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> tissue by the proposed method has been determined. The residual urea content in the meat of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> after IR blanching is 0. 76 %, which is two times lesser than border value of sensitivity of the person (approximated as 1. 2 %).

Because the biomass of <b>thorny</b> <b>skates</b> has {{recently}} declined below threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act, commercial harvests from this region are prohibited. We have undertaken a comprehensive study to gain insight into the life history of this skate. The present study describes and characterizes the reproductive cycle of female and male <b>thorny</b> <b>skates,</b> based on monthly samples taken off the coast of New Hampshire, from May 2001 to May 2003. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), shell gland weight, follicle size, and egg case formation, were assessed for 48 female skates. In general, these reproductive parameters remained relatively constant throughout most of the year. However, transient but significant increases in shell gland weight and GSI were obser ved during certain months. Within the cohort of specimens sampled monthly throughout the year, a subset of females always had large preovulatory follicles present in their ovaries. With the exception of June and September specimens, egg cases undergoing various stages of development were observed in the uteri of specimens captured during all other months of the year.

Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five <b>skate</b> species- <b>thorny</b> (Amblyraja radiata), Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for <b>thorny</b> and Arctic <b>skates</b> were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for smooth skate. Round skate has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for Arctic skate. Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. <b>Thorny</b> <b>skate</b> showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and round skate did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO. <b>Thorny</b> <b>skate</b> appear as dominant predator in NAFO Div. 3 NO...|$|R
40|$|The Spanish skate {{fishery in}} NAFO Regulatory Area is {{performed}} from August to November in a quite restricted area of Div. 3 N at depths between 51 and 100 m. Fishing effort, unstandardized catch rates, length composition, sexual maturity, by-catch, discards and sex-ratios {{are presented in}} this paper. The length range of <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> in the catches is mainly between 30 and 85 cm, with a mode of 50 - 51 cm. Both sexes appeared equally represented in the catches. The main by-catch in this fishery is American plaice and yellowtail flounder. A large proportion of mature males are observed...|$|R

In general, stocks sizes have declined significantly until the early- 1990 s and remained {{at a low}} level since then. They are presently composed of small and mainly juvenile specimens.

40|$|Results from {{cooperative}} grid {{surveys conducted}} in July showed that catch rates of yellowtail flounder were consistently high in July surveys (580 - 840 kg/hr) from 1996 through 2002. The 2002 CPUE for yellowtail {{was the highest}} in the series, but similar to the July surveys in 1998 and 2000. Catches of American plaice, cod and <b>thorny</b> <b>skate</b> also varied but were relatively stable at a lower level (less than 230 kg/hr) in those same surveys. The 2002 survey of the expanded grid area gave similar results compared to the 2001 expanded grid survey, with the yellowtail CPUE increasing again in 2002...|$|R
