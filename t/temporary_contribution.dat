However, this time consolidation {{is taking place in}} the aftermath of a deep crisis which had lead to increased levels of uncertainty. In addition the financial sector, as well as its regulation is under reconstruction. Firms and consumers are deleveraging, and many countries are trying to consolidate at the same time. We develop ten guidelines for consolidation during such a difficult economic period. We compare them to other guidelines published and, to the extent possible, cross-check whether the upcoming consolidation programs being implemented or revealed in various countries comply with our guidelines. We propose to follow a "high road" on cutting deficits, which includes an active growth enhancing component during the consolidation period. The "active component" should be financed by deeper cuts in subsidies, by eliminating obsolete government expenditure as well as by increasing the efficiency of the public sector. Taxes should not be raised permanently – a <b>temporary</b> <b>contribution</b> to consolidation will be needed, but tax structures in general should be made more growth and employment friendly. budget consolidation, financial crisis, tax and expenditure structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this project focuses on how Landscape Architects by their {{profession}} can explore and directly {{make a difference in}} the cityscape. This paper documents the process of art - based research practice. The purpose of installing temporary activities is to encourage people in the city to discover, participate and invite people to be more playful in the city. My experience of interaction in public spaces comes primarily from the education within landscape architecture, from site-specific art installations I have performed in different cities and from observations of landscape architecture, street art and urban life in the cities of Vienna, Berlin and Linköping. It is fascinating and inspiring to see how the urban space can invite and allow visitors to participate and therefore feel invited to the open space. As a landscape architect I wish to create urban spaces that are useful and inspiring for their visitors. The projects main question: How can you make temporary landscapes that encourage outdoorinspired activities at selected locations in the city? is answered by practice based research, an approach in which theoretical research are developed through practical experiments in the designing- and implementation process. In the process the theoretical foundation develops into build site-specific landscapes. The project has been put together by different kinds of research, the outdoor-inspired activities has been based and summarized on theoretical research. The locations for temporary landscape have been found through Photowalks, a method used for documenting spaces of uncertainty in the city. The designing process has been based on theory and inspiration, and developed into six designing proposals through full-scale drawings and photo collages. In the implementation processes the proposals transformed into an exhibition of temporary landscape at six locations in Linköping, from the 3 rd until the 15 th of April 2012. Temporary landscape is a momentary happening in the existing landscape. The method is used to create interesting meeting points that engage people to discover the site. The <b>temporary</b> <b>contribution</b> allows people to see the city in a new way and makes them aware of their surroundings. It is a concept that recognizes the human need for experiences and it creates opportunities to develop in the daily used environments. There are a lot of unused locations in the cities, usually called margins. These places are often perceived as a free zone, with possibilities to participate and to interact more spontaneously. To enable people to be activated and inspired by the cityscape, the margins and the open spaces has to be inviting, interesting and allow participation. Connections to outdoor delectation are used through the project to transform the curiosity and participation that can be experienced in the nature to experiences in the city. The theme Outdoor delectation in the city summarizes the theoretical approach, where the importances of discovering, participation and to move more freely in the city are being motivated. To explore the city is important for people’s personal development, it is also an important process in which people develop their understanding for the surroundings. The possibilities people have to discover the urban surroundings effects how well people thrive and are connected to their environment. Our movement is a way to discover and learn about the city, outdoor daily physical exercise does also have important effects on our health. Our movement is influences by the surroundings, the cityscape are often static and repetitious. The city is dominated by accessible communication routes that don’t inspire us to move freely or spontaneously. To become involved in the cityscape the margins need to be inviting, changeable and suggest encouraging activities. The practice based research evolved into an exhibition, where temporary landscapes were created at six locations in the city centre of Linköping. The first site was on an open lawn in Järnvägsparken, where a Killer ball field was created by drawing white lines on the lawn. Soft balls where placed in a basket near the field. The second site was on a pedestrian and bicycle path along the road Repslagaregatan. There a pattern was fixed to the pavement and formed a route in which you could jump between different boxes on the ground in a Motion Street. The third site was on the neglected square Magasintorget, smaller plant of spruce where planted in a wooden frame, a plank in the middle created a walk between the trees. On one edge a blackboard was places that could be drawn on with white calk, the installation was called Planned. The fourth site was places on the traditional square Hospitaltorget, here three chairs out of A 4 paper cartons where placed as a lounge and formed the installation called Can you handle it. The fifth site was in the crossing between Drottninggatan and Djurgårdsgatan. Six stone blocks and a pile of gravel where placed on opposite corners, the object symbolized the process in which natural materials are deformed and transported into the city, Block to gravel. The sixth site was in the park area between the Cathedral and the City Library on Benzeliusplatsen, here two bookshelves where placed next to the benches, here people could exchange and find books in the open-air library, Exchange books. The exhibition of temporary landscape achieved to encourage people to discover, participate and become activated on the locations. Many people became curious and stopped to explore the sites, people played sports in the park, jumped along the pattern at the Motion Street, left notes on the blackboard and took a small walk through the trees at the installation Planned, people rested on the chairs at Hospitaltorget, discovered the blocks and tried to go up on the gravelled pile in the traffic junction at Drottninggatan – Djurgårdsgatan, many people exchanged or curiously searched for books in the bookshelves at Benzeliusplatsen. The exhibition Outdoor delectation in the city was a way to encouraged people to discover, participate and move more freely in the city margins. The process of creating temporary landscapes contains the entire process from idée to installed site-specific objects. The project has also shown that the method can be used to see how landscape architects and planners are affecting how people discover and feel participation in their city Important guidelines to creating and to implement temporary landscape in public spaces are to find a context to work from, to set limitations and create a framework to start from. In the project I contacted and collaborated with the municipality and its contractors, in the beginning I also defined and set clear goals for the project which could be achieved during the project time and the given permissions. Experience of practice based researched through this project has shown: the importance to first experience and discovering the locations where the temporary landscape will be created, the need to constantly evaluate the design proposals, to seek expert advice for material and construction matters. The most essential thing within the research is to dare and explore new ways, to constantly evolve the proposals, to effectively make new decisions and see challenges as a thriving force that shapes the ideas into something better for this particular situation, set milestones so the project constantly carries on. ...|$|E

First, this is a response to recent calls for fresh and more interdisciplinary approaches to thinking about the practice of OD. Second, it is a provocation, for their choice of decoration is also a call for greater humility in OD&# 039;s ambitions. Rather than seek a more strategic or architectural role for OD, organizational decoration works instead at the surface and {{in the realm of the}} aesthetic. And within that realm the authors have deliberately chosen decoration over design (a term far more familiar to OD) because decoration more closely represents the ordinary and often <b>temporary</b> <b>contributions</b> that the authors advocate.

Bacterial transcription factor DksA and its cofactor alarmone ppGpp were proposed to contribute to prevention of such colli-sions, although the mechanism of this activity re-mains elusive. Here we show that DksA/ppGpp do not destabilise transcription elongation complexes or inhibit their backtracking, as was proposed ear-lier.

40|$|Demographic change {{confronts the}} German Pay-As-You-Go pension system with serious problems. For this reason, {{reductions}} {{in the level of}} public pensions were adopted under the pension reform in 2001, which also strengthened significantly the funded second and third pillars of old-age provision. The introduction of the supplementary pension provision brings with itself two major risks we are going to analyse in the present paper. One risk is implied by the voluntariness of supplementary arrangements. There is uncertainty over whether households � in particular the less affluent ones � will show the willingness and/or the capability to accumulate supplementary savings for their old age consistently. A further risk for supplementary old-age provision - which could as well be seen as a chance � rests in the return on contributions. Critics of funded private retirement provision often point at the return risk, in particular {{against the backdrop of the}} recent developments on capital markets. This paper asks whether under these risks, households will be able to close the gap arising from a reduction of public pension levels and to which degree there is scope for <b>temporary</b> suspensions of <b>contributions</b> to supplementary schemes. ...|$|R
50|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is essential for}} the formation of granulation tissue. The early stage of granulation tissue is dominated by a HA-rich extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a conducive environment for migration of cells into this <b>temporary</b> wound matrix. <b>Contributions</b> of HA to cell migration may attribute to its physicochemical properties as stated above, as well as its direct interactions with cells. For the former scenario, HA provides an open hydrated matrix that facilitates cell migration, whereas, in the latter scenario, directed migration and control of the cell locomotory mechanisms are mediated via the specific cell interaction between HA and cell surface HA receptors. As discussed before, the three principal cell surface receptors for HA are CD44, RHAMM, and ICAM-1. RHAMM is more related to cell migration. It forms links with several protein kinases associated with cell locomotion, for example, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p125fak, and pp60c-src. During fetal development, the migration path through which neural crest cells migrate is rich in HA. HA is closely associated with the cell migration process in granulation tissue matrix, and studies show that cell movement can be inhibited, at least partially, by HA degradation or blocking HA receptor occupancy.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{degradation}} {{is one of}} the {{key issues}} hindering direct methanol fuel cell commercialization, caused by different mechanisms interplaying locally and resulting in both <b>temporary</b> and permanent <b>contributions.</b> This work proposes a systematic experimental investigation, coupling in-situ diagnostics (electro- chemical and mass transport investigation) with ex-situ analyses of pristine, activated and aged com- ponents (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy), with an in-plane and through-plane local resolution. Such a combined approach allows to identify on one hand the degra- dation mechanisms, the affected components and the presence of heterogeneities; on the other hand, it allows to quantify the effect of the major mechanisms on performance decay. Thanks to a novel pro- cedure, temporary (21 mV h 1) and permanent degradation (59 mV h 1) are separated, distinguishing the latter in different contributions: the effects of active area loss at both at anode (9 mV h 1) and cathode (31 mV h 1), mass transport issue (15 mV h 1) and membrane decay (4 mV h 1). The post-mortem analysis highlights the effect of degradation mechanisms consistent with the in-situ analysis and reveals the presence of considerable in plane and through plane heterogeneities in: particle size growth in catalyst layers, Pt/Ru and polymer content in catalyst and diffusion layers, Pt/Ru precipitates in the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Most seismic {{building}} codes estimate the design forces in structures {{based on the}} seismic coefficient C(T), where T is the "fundamental vibration period of the building. " For structures on flexible soil, the relative response is the largest at the first period of the soil-structure system, which should be substituted in the code equation. This period depends {{not only on the}} structure itself, but also on the properties of the foundation system, of the surrounding soil, and on the contact conditions between the foundation and the soil. Studies for selected buildings have shown that this period can vary significantly during earthquake shaking as function of the level of shaking, reflecting changes in stiffness of the structure and of the soil (permanent or temporary), and changes in the bonding between the foundation and the soil, and can be very different from the estimates using ambient vibration data. For further refinement of the existing and development of new design code procedures, {{it is important to understand}} these changes and estimate their range during strong earthquake shaking, which is done best by analysis of actual earthquake response data for a large number of buildings.; This report summarizes the results of a one year project, which involved compilation of new and gathering and analysis of existing processed strong motion data of building responses in the Los Angeles area, particularly of buildings that recorded the 1994 Northridge earthquake and aftershocks, with the objective to estimate the variation of the first system frequency as a function of the level of shaking and time. Results are shown for 7 buildings for which strong motion data has been archived by U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), and which have been instrumented by USGS or by the building owner. The "instantaneous" system frequency and amplitude of response were estimated by two methods: zero crossing analysis, and from the ridges and skeletons of the Gabor transform. In general, the trend indicated by these data is decrease during the earthquakes that caused the largest levels of response (1994 Northridge main event, 1971 San Fernando earthquake), and "recovery" during the shaking from the aftershocks. For one of the buildings, a significant change that occurred during the San Fernando earthquake (30 % reduction) appears to have been permanent. For most buildings, the frequency changed up to 20 %, but for two buildings, the change was about 30 %. A permanent reduction of the frequency is consistent with permanent loss of stiffness, while a "recovery" to the initial or higher value is consistent with the interpretation that the change was mainly due to changes in the soil (rather than in the structure itself), or changes in the bond between the soil and the foundation. Other causes of the <b>temporary</b> changes include <b>contribution</b> of the nonstructural elements to the total stiffness resisting the seismic forces, and opening of existing cracks in the concrete structures. The degree to which each of these causes contributed to the temporary changes cannot be determined from the current instrumentation, but fortunately, what matters for the {{building codes}} is the overall effect...|$|R
