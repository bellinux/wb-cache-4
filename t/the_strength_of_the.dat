5|$|Fluorocarbon gases are {{generally}} greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 20,000 {{times that of}} carbon dioxide.

5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld.
