METHOD: Clinical and laboratory data were collected regularly in both cohorts, and patients completed biannual questionnaires reporting health care utilization and number of days lost from work. RESULTS: Disease activity was similar in both cohorts T 1 and T 2 at inclusion. Significant improvements were seen {{during the first}} year in both cohorts but were more pronounced in T 2. Outpatient care increased and hospitalization decreased in T 2 compared with T 1. Almost 3 % of patients had surgery in both cohorts, but in T 2, only women had surgery. Drug costs were higher in T 2 than in T 1 (EUR 689 vs. EUR 435). In T 2, 12 % of drug costs were direct costs and 4 % were <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> The corresponding <b>values</b> for T 1 were 9 % and 3 %. In T 1, 50 % were prescribed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at inclusion, compared to T 2, where prescription was > 90 %. Direct costs were EUR 5716 in T 2 and EUR 4674 in T 1. Costs for sick leave were lower in T 2 than in T 1 (EUR 5490 vs. EUR 9055) but disability pensions were higher (EUR 4152 vs. EUR 2139), resulting in unchanged <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> In T 1, direct costs comprised 29 % and indirect costs 71 % of the <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> The corresponding <b>values</b> for T 2 were 37 % and 63 %.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an international {{overview of the}} most recent estimates of the social costs of road crashes: <b>total</b> <b>costs,</b> <b>value</b> per casualty and breakdown in cost components. It answers the question to what extent the <b>total</b> social <b>costs</b> of road crashes differ between countries and what the explanations for these differences are. The analysis is based on national reports about costs of road crashes of 16 countries, of which nine high income countries (HICs) and seven low and middle income countries (LMICs). The analysis shows that the share of social costs of road crashes in HICs ranges from 1. 0 to 4. 6 % {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP) with an average of 2. 6 %. The main explanations for differences between these countries are differences in methodologies regarding valuation of human costs and correction for underreporting. Excluding countries that do not use a ‘willingness to pay’ method (that is internationally recommended) for estimating human costs and countries that do not correct for underreporting, results in an average share of the costs of 3. 7 % of GDP. For LMICs that do correct for underreporting the share in GDP ranges from 1. 2 to 3. 0 %. However, none of the LMICs included has performed a willingness to pay study into the human costs. A major part of the costs is related to injuries: an average share of 50 % for both HICs and LMICs. The share of fatalities in the costs is 20 % and 30 % respectively. Prevention of injuries is thus important to bring down the socio-economic burden of road crashes. The paper shows that there are a number of methodological differences between countries regarding cost components that are taken into account and regarding the methods used to estimate specific cost components. In order to be able to make sound comparisons of the costs of road crashes across countries, (further) harmonization of cost studies is recommended. This can be reached by updating and improving international guidelines and applying them in future cost studies. The information regarding some cost components, particularly human costs and property damage, is poor and more research into these cost components is recommended...|$|R

The objective was to estimate the annual costs of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and mental disorders (MD) attributable to job strain exposure according to Karasek's model in France for the year 2003 from a societal perspective. METHODS: We produced attributable fraction estimates which were applied to the number of cases (morbidity and mortality) and the costs of CHD and MD. Relative risk estimates came from a systematic literature review of prospective studies. We conducted meta-analyses based on this selection of studies. Prevalence of exposure to job strain came from the national SUMER survey conducted in France in 2003. Costs included direct medical costs and indirect costs: production losses due to sick leaves and premature deaths. RESULTS: Between 8. 8 and 10. 2 % of CHD morbidity was attributable to job strain, and between 9. 4 and 11. 2 % of CHD mortality was attributable to this exposure for men. Between 15. 2 and 19. 8 % of MD was attributable to job strain for men, and between 14. 3 and 27. 1 % for women. As a whole, between 450 000 and 590 000 cases of diseases and 910 [...] 1130 deaths were attributable to job strain for men. From 730 000 to 1 380 000 cases of diseases and from 150 to 280 deaths were attributable to job strain for women. The total number of sick leave days amounted from 5 to 6. 6 million days for men, and from 8. 5 to 16 million days for women. The <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> of CHD and MD attributable to job strain exposure ranged from 1. 8 to 3 billion euros for the year 2003 (0. 12 - 0. 19 % GDP).

40|$|The basic {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the assessment of the European seismic design codes and in particular of EC 2 and EC 8 with respect to the recommended behaviour factor q. The assessment is performed on two reinforced concrete multi-storey buildings, having symmetrical and non-symmetrical plan view respectively, which were optimally designed under four different values of the behaviour factor. In the mathematical formulation of the optimization problem the initial construction cost is considered as the objective function to be minimized while the cross sections and steel reinforcement of the beams and the columns constitute the design variables. The provisions of Eurocodes 2 and 8 are imposed as constraints to the optimization problem. Life-cycle cost analysis, in conjunction with structural optimization, is believed to be a reliable procedure for assessing the performance of structures during their life time. The two most important findings that can be deduced are summarized as follows: (1) The proposed Eurocode behaviour factor does not lead to a more economical design with respect to the <b>total</b> life-cycle <b>cost</b> compared to other values of q (q = 1, 2).

A model of dynamic decision making by fishermen is developed to study the biological and {{economic impact of the}} commercial exploitation of the Georges Bank scallops fishery (Placopecten Magellanicus). Stock biomass abundance dynamics are modelled using Deriso's age structured population model. Growth rate, mortality rates and recruitment are included as part of the biological component of the model. Decision making by fishermen is modelled using two discrete decision algorithms, myopic and adaptive. The myopic model provides the fisherman with the area yielding the highest immediate expected return on the basis of cost, expected catch and the current measure of biomass abundance. A computer model simulates the application of both the myopic and adaptive algorithms by a single fisherman as well as by a fleet of fishermen. In the later case, each fisherman is assumed to be initially identical and independent of the others in the fleet with respect to landings and catch information compiled. Vessel performance is measured in terms of <b>total</b> catch, <b>total</b> <b>costs,</b> landed <b>values</b> and net incomes. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{was carried}} out at a company called OEM International, a Group within the {{technical}} trading business. OEM’s main focus is the trade of small components used for industrial automation. A few years of rapid growth resulted in over crowded and outgrown warehouses, one {{in the long run}} untenable situation. Plans of building a new, large warehouse grew and were also realized. But with the plans of building the new warehouse started discussions of what type of distribution chains and warehousing structure would suit OEM the best. This led to thoughts of moving towards a more centralized warehousing system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors that are of relevance when deciding upon whether or not to centralize a decentralized warehousing system. The study focused on identifying the parameters that are of importance, how they relate to each other and how they might be affected by a centralization of warehousing structure. The goal was to, based on the theoretical framework, present advantages and disadvantages of centralized vs. decentralized warehouse management, and to identify key factors in the decision process upon centralization. The study is therefore based on a case study at two of the warehouses within the OEM International Group. The literature search focused on the following fields: distribution management, centralized warehousing, delivery service and <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of distribution. With the theories identified in the literature used as a base interviews were held and thus a picture of the situation within OEM International was developed. Recurring concepts were identified and influencing factors could eventually be distinguished. Four broad areas for assessment of stock structure were identified.

40|$|As the {{penetration}} of wind power increases in power systems, {{there is a}} need to address the effect of wind forecasting error during the real time operation. The role of the Transmission System Operator (TSO) in electricity markets is to ensure safety and reliability of the power system. Currently, most power systems clear the spot market based on supply and demand bidding curves. Under the context of unit commitment, the objective of the TSO is to minimize the generation cost. Such an approach is usually deterministic and does not account for the uncertainties in the system. The aim of this thesis is to formulate a mathematical model that optimizes power system operation. This is achieved by taking into account the expected cost of wind power forecasting error with wind energy curtailment. An additional aim is to compare the operational cost of the proposed optimal system operation and the current system operation in the Nordic power system. The economic value of wind energy curtailment is also evaluated. It is observed that day ahead scheduling considering the expected cost of net demand forecasting error will reduce the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> significantly. In other words, when the wind uncertainty increases the ability to down regulate or the ability to curtail wind generation reduces the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of system operation. A 36 unit system with a lost load value of 6000 $/MWh is considered for different variations of standard deviation of net demand forecasting error. At 5 % of standard deviation (SD) of net demand forecasting error, the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of system as per the current system operation is 456221 $ while the case considering net demand forecasting error is 39859. 4 $. At SD of 20 %, for the case considering net demand forecasting error the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of current system operation is 1585510 $ while the case considering net demand forecasting error is 41380. 6 $. For SD values greater than 20 % the case with net demand forecasting error does not decreases the <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> For SD <b>values</b> higher than 20 %, a method is proposed which allows wind curtailment to have optimal system operation. At 55 % of SD, the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of the system operation with the proposed method is almost reduced by almost 63 times compared to the cost of current system operation case...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We aim {{to examine}} the capacitated multi-item lot sizing problem which is a typical example of a large bucket model, where many {{different}} items can be produced on the same machine in one time period. We propose {{a new approach to}} determine the production sequence and lot sizes that minimize the sum of start up and setup costs, inventory and production costs over all periods. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is composed of three steps. First, we compute a lower bound on <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> Then we propose a three sub-steps iteration procedure. We solve optimally the lot sizing problem without considering products sequencing and their cost. Then, we determine products quantities to produce each period while minimizing the storage and variable production costs. Given the products to manufacture each period, we determine its correspondent optimal products sequencing, by using a Branch and Bound algorithm. Given the sequences of products within each period, we evaluate the total start up and setup cost. We compare then the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> obtained to the lower bound of the <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> If this <b>value</b> riches a prefixed value, we stop. Otherwise, we modify the results of lot sizing problem. Findings and Originality/value: We show using an illustrative example, that the difference between the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> and its lower bound is only 10 %. This gap depends on the significance of the inventory and production costs and the machine’s capacity. Comparing the approach we develop with a traditional one, we show that we manage to reduce the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> by 30 %. Research limitations/implications: Our model fits better to real-world situations where production systems run continuously. This model is applied for limited number of part types and periods. Practical implications: Our approach determines the products to manufacture each time period, their economic amounts, and their scheduling within each period. This outcome should help decision makers bearing expensive start up and setup costs, to reduce their Inventory and Production costs and Start up and setup cots. Originality/value: The main idea of the proposed approach is to intelligibly reduce the number of products to manufacture within each period in order to decrease the setup cost; since in case of limited machine’s capacity, we show that setup costs could increase when reducing the total number of parts manufactured over the entire planning horizon. In fact, the triangular inequality in setup costs is proved to be not usually available. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} medical costs and {{effectiveness}} of acute treatment with imipramine versus acute treatment plus 2 different maintenance therapies for panic disorder. Methods: A clinical decision model was constructed to estimate 18 -month costs and outcomes associated with these treatment scenarios based on the medical literature and clinician judgment. The clinical parameters and outcomes for the model were derived {{from a series of}} systematic clinical trials with imipramine utilising uniform dosage procedures and validated response criteria. Costs were calculated based on standardised treatment regimens. The outcome measures were 18 -month medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs per QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of treatment withdrawals on outcomes. Study perspective: US mental healthcare system. Results: Over 18 months, the <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> (1997 <b>values)</b> and QALYs associated with half-dose maintenance therapy (imipramine 1. 1 mg/kg/day) [$US 3377; QALYs = 0. 991] and full-dose maintenance therapy (imipramine 2. 25 mg/kg/ day) [$US 3361; QALYs = 0. 991] were almost identical; both were cost saving compared with acute imipramine therapy (2. 25 mg/kg/day) with no maintenance treatment ($US 3691; QALYs = 0. 979). Whether patients withdrawing from treatment were considered to have continued to respond to treatment or to have relapsed, the half-dose and full-dose maintenance treatments were still cost saving compared with acute treatment alone. Conclusions: The results indicate that imipramine maintenance treatment is cost effective compared with acute imipramine treatment for patients with panic disorder. The basic findings and conclusions are not affected after modifying model assumptions for clinical response in patients withdrawing from treatment.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{expected}} <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> (ETC) criterion for discrete-time Markov control processes on Borel spaces, and possibly unbounded cost-per-stage functions. It presents optimality results which include {{conditions for a}} control policy to be ETC-optimal and for the ETC-value function to be a solution of the dynamic programming equation. Conditions are also given for the ETC-value function to be the limit of the alpha-discounted <b>cost</b> <b>value</b> function as alpha up arrow 1, and for the Markov control process to be 'stable' {{in the sense of}} Lagrange and almost surely. In addition, transient control models are fully analized.
