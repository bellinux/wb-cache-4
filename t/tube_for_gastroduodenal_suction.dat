40|$|Background: The {{hospitalization}} {{and mortality}} rate <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer {{in the elderly}} remain very high. It {{may be attributed to}} increase prescriptions <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> damaging drugs, including the non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the profile of elderly patients 2 ̆ 7 characteristics who had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at Kariadi Hospital. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted in elderly patients with non-variceal EGD at Kariadi Hospital, Semarang between Januari 2009 and December 2010. Analysis statistic was performed using chi-square test, with SPSS version 19. Results: Among records for a total of 164 cases of eldery patients who had undergone EGD, 90 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 64 (71. 1...|$|R
40|$|Herein {{we report}} the {{efficacy}} of embolization of small patent gastric or duodenal vessels <b>for</b> treating <b>gastroduodenal</b> complications after hepatic arterial infusion therapy (HAIC). Catheter ports were implanted percutaneously from a femoral approach in three cases or surgically in the gastroduodenal artery in two cases. Acute abdominal pain developed on average after four HAIC courses of 5 FU-oxaliplatin, mytomycin, oxaliplatin or fotemustine. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed gastroduodenal lesions (gastroduodenitis with or without ulcerations) in all cases. Despite the interruption of the HAIC, symptoms persisted and led to selective hepatic arteriography showing a patent right gastric artery (n = 4) or a recanalized gastroduodenal artery (n = 1) responsible <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> misperfusion. Successful embolizations of the arteries responsible <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> misperfusion (right gastric artery in four cases and gastroduodenal artery in one case) using 0. 018 platinium coils relieved the patients' symptoms and allowed the HAIC to continue. In gastroduodenal complications of HAIC, a selective hepatic arteriography should be performed to search any artery responsible for the misperfusion of the toxic agent in the gastroduodenal area. Embolization of these arteries allowed the HAIC to be restored...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} reviews briefly {{the history}} of the discovery and characterization of peptic activity; secretory models and current concepts regarding the regulation of pepsinogen secretion; and evidence that pepsin is a necessary co-factor <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> mucosal injury. Several animal studies indicate that peptic activity is required for acid- and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory druginduced gastroduodenal ulceration. A more vigorous approach to the development of anti-peptic drugs for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease is encouraged...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Erosive and {{ulcerative}} gastroduodenal bleedings {{observed in}} patients with cardiac disease, {{are associated with a}} high rate of mortality and significantly complicate the course of the underlying disease. Studying the etiology of erosive and ulcerative lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract mucosa in these patients may serve as a basis for the development of preventive measures <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> hemorrhage. The multiple treatment of patients with erosive and ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding complicating a cardiac disease should be carried out with the interaction of antisecretory drugs and antiplatelet drugs.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori is a {{relevant}} pathogen <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> diseases in human beings.

40|$|Current {{guidelines}} <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> tuberculosis {{suggest that}} surgery {{in conjunction with}} anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) is the primary therapy. We determined the efficacy of endoscopic balloon dilatation along with ATT as the primary treatment for this condition. Patients with gastric outlet obstruction at endoscopy seen {{over a two-year period}} underwent multiple biopsies from the involved area. Those in whom mucosal biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation, underwent endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Patients showing granulomatous inflammation with/without acid-fast bacilli (AFB) underwent endoscopic balloon dilatation under fluoroscopic guidance along with ATT. End point of dilatation was taken as dilatation with 18 mm balloon. The time taken to resume normal diet post endotherapy was determined. Thirteen patients were diagnosed to have gastroduodenal tuberculosis. Granulomatous inflammation with or without demonstration of AFB was documented in 92 % of the patients by endoscopic biopsy and EMR. Endoscopic balloon dilatation of the strictures was successful in 11 / 12 patients (92 %); these patients could resume their normal diet at a median of 11 days (range 7 - 60) post-dilatation. Retroperitoneal perforation in 1 patient was managed conservatively. Endoscopic therapy in combination with ATT is recommended as the first line therapy <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> tuberculosis. Surgical intervention is reserved for the minority in whom endoscopic therapy fails.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate {{changes in the}} surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease in our clinic before (the first period : 1975 - 81) and after (the latter period : 1982 - 88) introduction of H₂-receptor antagonists. 1. The number of surgically treated peptic ulcer cases decreased by 66 % from the first period to the latter period, that was mainly due to the decrease {{of the number of}} surgically treated intractable ulcer cases. 2. The number of cases operated on for complications decreased slightly as a whole, but the number of cases operated on for stenosis increased in the latter period. 3. The ratio of patients over sixty years old and the ratio of females of the first period increased about two times as much as that of the latter period. 4. About the location of peptic ulcer, gastroduodenal ulcer showed highest rate of decrease from the first period to the latter period. 5. Most useful surgical procedures in the first period were pylorus preserving gastrectomy (PPG) for gastric ulcer, selective vagotomy with antrectomy (SV + A) for duodenal ulcer, and selective vagotomy vith hemigastrectomy (SV + H) <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer. In the latter period these were gastric resection for gastric ulcer, SV + A for duodenal ulcer, and both SV + A and gastric resection <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of clinical material through 10 -year-period (1980 - 1989) is presented. There were 708 gastric operations performed <b>for</b> <b>gastroduodenal</b> ulcer disease.
