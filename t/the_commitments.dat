5|$|In January 2000, it was {{announced}} that Miramax had commissioned playwright Warren Leight to write a direct sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Commitments,</b> with Cathy Konrad attached as a producer. The main plot for the sequel was to feature several members of <b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> pairing with new band members before going on tour in the United States. The sequel was never produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> premiered at the Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California on 7 August 1991, the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas in Century City, Los Angeles on 13 August 1991, and the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, Ireland on 19 September 1991. In North America, 20th Century Fox gave <b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> a {{platform}} release which involved opening {{the film in}} select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. The film opened in limited release on 14 August 1991 before opening nationwide on 13 September 1991. The English-based distributor Sovereign Pictures handled international distribution. The film was released in Ireland on 4 October 1991.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, <b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> grossed $14.9 {{million during}} its North American {{theatrical}} run. Reviewers praised the music, performances and humour, while criticism {{was aimed at}} the pacing and direction. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing, and won four BAFTA Awards for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. While only a modest success with North American audiences, <b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> has since been regarded as a cult film {{and one of the}} best Irish films ever made. It is the first in a series of films known as The Barrytown Trilogy, followed by The Snapper (1993) and The Van (1996).|$|E
40|$|The larval-pupal {{transformation}} of Manduca sexta results from an exposure to ecdysteroids {{in the absence}} of juvenile hormone (<b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse), followed by a larger exposure to ecdysteroids (the prepupal peak) with a reappearance of juvenile hormone (JH). The prepupal ecdysteroid peak triggers the degeneration of abdominal muscles, and the dendritic regression and death of identified moto-neurones. The present experiments examined the role of <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse in <b>the</b> larval-pupal reprogramming of these cells. <b>The</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse did not overtly affect the muscles and motoneurones, but it switched their hormonal responsiveness; before <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse, exposure to ecdysteroids in the presence of JH had no effect on the larval cells, whereas after <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse <b>the</b> same treatment caused regression and death. Thus, JH lost its ability to prevent pupal development. Furthermore, treatment with ecdysteroids {{in the absence of}} JH before <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse promoted pupal development much less effectively than did the same treatment given after <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse facilitates <b>the</b> subsequent responsiveness to ecdysteroids. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse covertly causes both qualitative and quantitative changes in the hormonal sensitivity of the larval muscles and motoneurones...|$|R

5|$|Doyle's novel {{inspired}} a 2013 musical stage production, directed by British theatre director Jamie Lloyd. Following the film's success, Doyle had previously turned down offers to adapt his novel into a stage production. <b>The</b> <b>Commitments</b> began previews on 21 September 2013 in London's West End at the Palace Theatre.

Although a script was completed, Myles felt it needed improvement, and passed the book on to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, hoping that they would suggest a more experienced writer. However, upon reading the novel, Clement and La Frenais agreed to help write the script themselves.|$|E

30|$|Catalano and Fiore [12] formalized a {{powerful}} cryptographic primitive named vector <b>commitment.</b> Informally speaking, <b>the</b> notion of vector commitment {{allows one to}} commit to an vector (m_ 1,...,m_q) {{in such a way}} that the committer can later open <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> at specific positions. Also, nobody should be able to open a commitment to two different values at the same position (this is called position binding). Besides, <b>the</b> vector <b>commitment</b> should be concise, i.e., the size of <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> string and <b>the</b> opening are both independent of <b>the</b> vector <b>commitment</b> q. Additionally, <b>the</b> vector <b>commitment</b> should be updatable for constructing a VDB scheme. That is, it is required that the committer is able to update <b>the</b> original <b>commitment</b> value by changing a specific component of the vector and the opening would still be valid for <b>the</b> updated <b>commitment.</b> <b>The</b> detailed formal definition of vector commitment can be found in [12].|$|R

5|$|The {{perception}} {{of communism in}} the US was shaped by the Cold War, which began after World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold <b>the</b> <b>commitments</b> it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E

The Corrs signed with Atlantic Records in 1995 and travelled to North America to record their debut album Forgiven, Not Forgotten. The album featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. When released, it was successful in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Spain.

5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant general the same day. During his tenure, he was predominantly concerned with planning for possible {{deployment of the}} ARRC in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was eventually deployed to Afghanistan, but not until after Dannatt had handed over its command to David Richards. Dannatt was knighted with his investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in June 2004. He succeeded Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as Commander-in-Chief, Land Command (CINCLAND)—responsible for day-to-day running of the Army—on 7 March 2005, and was promoted to full general the same day. The prevailing issue during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief was the reorganisation of the infantry, an emotive issue as it resulted {{in the loss of}} many historic regimental names, including Dannatt's regiment, the Green Howards, which became 2nd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards). However, his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect <b>the</b> <b>commitments</b> of the British Armed Forces at the time.|$|E
5|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in 1899, {{many members of the}} mounted police wanted to {{volunteer}} to serve in South Africa, motivated by sympathy for the British imperial cause and the strong military tradition within the force. Indeed, Commissioner Herchmer had proposed sending a force of 350 men to join the Sudan campaign in 1896, but was turned down by his superiors. Although there was public enthusiasm for a Canadian military response, at first it appeared that only a minimal deployment would be needed, and it was only after several British defeats that an offer of a more substantive force was welcomed by London. The Canadian government turned to the mounted police as their main source for experienced mounted soldiers, and members were given leave from the force for the duration of their service. Combined with the pressures of maintaining <b>the</b> <b>commitments</b> in the Yukon, this reduced the number of the police in the remaining territories to only 682 men by 1900.|$|E
