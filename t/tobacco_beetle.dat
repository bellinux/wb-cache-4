40|$|Die Lagererzwespe Lariophagus distinguendus ist eine generalistische Parasitoidenart, welche die Larven von {{mindestens}} 11 verschiedenen Käferarten parasitiert. Die Wirte leben alle entweder endophytisch in Samen oder in Kokons (STEIDLE & SCHÖLLER 1997). Bei der Parasitierung stechen die Weibchen die Samen oder Kokons an und legen jeweils ein Ei an die Außenseite der Wirtslarve (Abb. 1). Die Parasitioidenlarve frisst von außen an dem Wirt, der dabei abgetötet wird. Die Parasitoidenlarve verpuppt sich im Samen oder Kokon, aus dem schließlich eine erwachsene Wespe schlüpft. [...] . Lariophagus distinguendus (FÖRSTER) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is a parasitoid of larvae and pupae of {{a number}} of beetle species that are pests of stored products. For biological control of the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) L. distinguendus is currently commercially available in Germany. To study the ability of this strain to parasitize the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle</b> and develop on this host, pairs of L. distinguendus were offered larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle</b> of three different age classes. The results reveal that L. distinguendus is able to develop on larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle.</b> Obviously, the oldest larval stage of the beetle is most suitable for development. This makes the strain of L. distinguendus utilised in this experiment generally suitable for the biological control of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle...</b>|$|E
30|$|Figure  6 {{shows the}} {{progression}} of instars of all ten larvae, {{as well as the}} durations of instars, inactivity due to ecdysis, and prepupal and pupal stages. Five larvae underwent seven instars (“ 7 -instar type”) and the other five underwent eight instars (“ 8 -instar type”), suggesting that the number of instars can vary in this species. Although other numbers of instars were not found in this study because of the limitation of the number of AE measurement channels, it is possible that other instar types were present, with low abundance ratios. In related species, for example, variation in the number of larval instars was reported for the brown powderpost beetle Lyctus brunneus (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) [17] and the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle</b> Lasioderma serricorne (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) [18]. The larval duration of 8 -instar larvae was significantly longer than that of 7 -instar larvae (Student’s t test, p[*]<[*] 0.01). The adult body length was not significantly different between the instar types (Student’s t test, p[*]>[*] 0.05), although the sample sizes may be too small to discuss differences among instar types. Sexual differences {{may be one of the}} factors causing the difference in the total number of instars. However, the sexes of the employed individuals were not identified in this experiment, limiting further discussion; the clarification of sexual differences in larval development is a subject for future analysis.|$|E
5000|$|It can repel <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetles,</b> pinhead-sized pests {{which can}} ruin entire stocks of cigars by eating the tobacco and laying eggs, causing further infestation. They {{can also be}} {{discouraged}} by ensuring the humidor does not get hotter than 20 C. The beetle eggs usually only hatch at around 25 C, although there are also instances where they will hatch at cooler temperatures if the humidity is too high.|$|R
50|$|All humidors {{contain a}} {{permanent}} humidifying system which keeps the air moist, {{which in turn}} keeps the cigars moist. Without a humidor, within 2 to 3 days, cigars will quickly lose moisture and level up with the general humidity around them. The ideal relative humidity in a humidor is around 68-72%. Though it can vary slightly depending on the cigar smoker's preferences, it should never go higher than 75% due {{to the possibility of}} hatching <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetles.</b> The more empty space, the more readily the humidity level of the box will fluctuate.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Entomopathogenic fungi are ubiquitous, soil borne {{microorganisms}} {{of scientific}} importance owing to their potential use as biological control agents {{of a wide}} range of arthropod pests of agricultural produce. The aims of this study included an assessment of this potential against two prominent insect pests of stored agro-commodities under controlled laboratory conditions, which presented the opportunity to isolate strains indigenous to South Africa. Three local strains of the entomopathogen, Beauveria bassiana, were successfully isolated from soils in the Northern Province and in comparative bioassays with five exotic strains of the same fungus evaluated to: 1. Determine the effects of different temperature on vegetative growth of the fungus. 2. Determine the effects of B. bassiana against the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera) using water formulations and dry spores to infect the insect. 3. Determine the effects of B. bassiana against the <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle,</b> Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) (Coleoptera) using water formulations at inundative rates of 108 conidia ml- 1 to infect the pest. Results indicated that the growth of local isolates of B. bassiana at different temperature was comparable with that of exotic isolates. Most isolates were found to grow optimally at 25 OC, with two isolates growing optimally at 20 OC and one at 28 OC. In vitro evaluations of the effects of B. bassiana against the maize weevil results included inundative rate inoculations, dose response assessments, effects of various temperatures on fungal virulence and dry spore assessments. In preliminary bioassays assessing the pathogenicity of B. bassiana against the maize weevil, insects were infected using water formulations of the fungus at inundative rates of 108 conidia ml- 1. The insect was highly susceptible to infection, with an average of 92...|$|E
40|$|Vorratsschädliche Insekten sind Spezialisten, die in der Lage sind, trockene pflanzliche Materialien aufzuspüren, zu besiedeln und damit über die Befeuchtung durch Respiration dem Abbau durch weitere Organismen (Pilze, Milben, Bakterien) zuzuführen. Auf diese Weise sind sie die Auslöser eines Kompostierungsprozesses. Durch ihr hervorragendes Orientierungsvermögen entlang eines Duftstoffgradienten finden sie sich regelmäßig in Vorratslagern und Gebäuden der Lebens- und Futtermittelverarbeitung ein, falls sie nicht bereits mit befallenen Produkten passiv eingeschleppt wurden. In der Praxis der Schädlingsbekämpfung in Deutschland werden zunehmend auch Verfahren der Hitzeentwesung in Gebäuden angeboten, die der Begasung mit giftigen Gasen Konkurrenz machen und auch in Betrieben des Ökolandbaus eingesetzt werden können. Einen Überblick über den Einsatz extremer Temperaturen im Vorratsschutz vermitteln die Arbeiten von Fields (1992), Burks et al. (2000) und Adler & Rassmann (2000). Laborversuche unter definierten Temperaturen hatten zum Ziel, die Widerstandsfähigkeit bestimmter Arten und ihrer Entwicklungsstadien zu überprüfen. Darüber hinaus wird kurz über Erfahrungen in der Praxis berichtet. Storage {{structures}} and buildings for food processing such as flour mills or bakeries can be disinfested by heat. This {{is done in}} Germany either {{by the use of}} ex-proof electric heaters or fossil-fuel burners, in which case heated air is fan-forced from outside into the structure through flexible ducts. Data presented here are from laboratory studies and practical heat treatments from 2001 - 2006 and summarize the relative sensitivity of immature and adult Mediterranean flour moths Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae), tobacco beetles Lasioderma serricorne (Coleoptera, Anobiidae), lesser grain borers Rhizopertha dominica (Col., Bostrychidae), granary weevils Sitophilus granarius and maize weevils S. zeamais (Col., Curculionidae), flat grain beetles Cryptolestes pusillus (Col., Cucujidae) and rustred flour beetles Tribolium castaneum (Col., Tenebrionidae). While the moth larvae proved rather sensitive towards high temperatures, the larvae and pupal stages of lesser grain borer and <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetle</b> where quite tolerant with 370 min required in lab studies for complete control at 50 °C for both species. At 55 °C complete control was achieved in up to 45 min. Experiences from practical treatments showed {{that it is difficult to}} achieve uniform temperatures at all locations in a large flour mill. In a number of cases, lethal temperatures could not be reached close to the outside walls in areas with faulty insulation, in narrow corners in the cellar or roof construction, and in insulating materials such as bag stacks of flour, packaging material, tightly packed electric cables, larger amounts of grain, malt, dust or garbage.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis was {{isolated}} from dried tobacco residues and dead <b>tobacco</b> <b>beetles</b> (Lasioderma serricorne (F.); Coleoptera: Anobiidae) {{collected in a}} large number of locations worldwide. Eighty-eight samples of stored tobacco were analyzed and yielded 78 B. thuringiensis strains which were characterized on the basis of parasporal crystal morphology, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles, and the results of an immunoblot analysis of the insecticidal crystal proteins. Flagellar antigen identification was used to differentiate selected isolates. Strains that produced rhomboidal crystals associated with the Coleoptera-specific pathotype (Cry III group) were the most abundant strains (59 % of the isolates). Preliminary toxicity assays were performed with L. serricorne larvae, and the results suggested that activity is not restricted to isolates related to the Coleoptera-specific group. The results of our survey indicate that B. thuringiensis is part of the natural microflora in the stored-tobacco environment and that this special habitat represents a source of B. thuringiensis isolates that may be used to control stored-product pests...|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetFlea beetles {{are common}} pests and {{frequently}} do serious damage to vegetable crops. Excessive feeding damage by flea beetles can stress and kill young plants. On maturing crops, feeding may scar leaves or fruit, resulting in cosmetic damage and reduced crop value at harvest. Some species are important vectors of crop disease. Flea beetles rapidly colonize crops {{at the onset}} of warm spring weather and serious damage can occur quickly. Species occurring in the northeastern United States include the corn, potato, crucifer, eggplant, striped, horseradish, palestriped, and <b>tobacco</b> flea <b>beetle.</b> Some of these are consistent pests, whereas others only occasionally cause serious damage. As the names imply, there is a certain degree of crop specificity associated with the various species of flea beetles, although many feed on several crops and numerous weeds. On occasion, other species of flea beetles may be present and cause damage to vegetables...|$|R
