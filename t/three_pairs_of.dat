5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are fused into a structure of <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> ganglia under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal ganglion.|$|E
5|$|From the front, the {{antennae}} and antennules are visible. Beside these {{there are}} the orbits in which the eyes are situated. The mouthparts comprise <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> maxillipeds, behind which there are a pair of maxillae, a pair of maxillules, and finally the mandibles.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon microphone, and an AKG), and <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was there for a sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E

5000|$|In 1689 the Mohawks {{began work}} on a new castle nearby. The {{proceedings}} of the City of Albany read: [...] "The Maquase desire by Arnout's letter to assist them with two or <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> horses and five or six men to ride the heqaviest stockades for their new castle of Tionondoge which they remove an English mile higher up." [...] The Albany government sent <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> horses and six men [...] "to show their good inclination and true friendship they entertained toward their Mohawk brethren." [...] Apparently this work had not been completed by 1693.|$|R

5|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} {{except those}} that have been modified to form one to four (usually <b>three)</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> short, movable spinnerets, which emit silk. Each spinneret has many spigots, each of which is connected to one silk gland. There are at least six types of silk gland, each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{an adult}} {{butterfly}} or moth (imago) has three distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing on {{both the left and}} the right side of the thorax and, like all insects, have <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> legs.|$|E
5|$|The stack {{was first}} climbed by mountaineers Chris Bonington, Rusty Baillie and Tom Patey in 1966. From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent {{featured}} in The Great Climb, a live BBC three-night outside broadcast, which had around 15 million viewers. This featured <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> climbers: Bonington and Patey repeated their original route, whilst two new lines were climbed by Joe Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis and by Pete Crew and Dougal Haston.|$|E
60|$|A {{chorus of}} exclamations was {{followed}} by a dive for the paper, and even the Major smiled grimly as he observed the three girlish heads close together and <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> eager eyes scanning swiftly the society columns.|$|R
6000|$|This dreadful threat had {{the desired}} effect, {{and through the}} two {{remaining}} fields the <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias [...] "bullheads," [...] which the lads looked at wistfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you had third-floor apartments," [...] Mr. Bows said; [...] "and was going to say--you will please not take my remark as discourteous--that the air up <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> stairs is wholesomer for gentlemen, than {{the air of a}} porter's lodge." ...|$|R
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into {{the upper and lower}} portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
50|$|MSCB was nationalised on 1 January 1895. The {{new owner}} and {{operator}} was the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways. There were <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> trains between Jägerndorf-Olmütz and Mährisch Schönberg. These train connections are available between Ziegenhals and Freiwaldau or Hannsdorf today as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, yes," [...] said Archie. [...] "I {{thought that}} was quite understood. I have been getting my traps {{together}}."

5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and {{one pair of}} antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E

5000|$|E. rufescens {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism. The probosis {{is long and}} flexible. The species' tails are dark-brown and can be long up to the its head-to-tail length.Females have <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> teats and the males have internal testes.Both adults and juveniles are similar in color. However, adults have white feet while juveniles' feet are brown.|$|R
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> legs, {{one pair}} on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional spiracle {{which is actually}} derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and femur are fused.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E

These Nicholas engaged, {{only too happy to}} have escaped any request for payment of a week's rent beforehand.|$|R
25|$|The Kelantese arms was {{introduced}} in 1916 under the order of Sultan Muhammad IV. Originally consisting of only the crescent and star, the <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> weapons and the motto, the kijangs and coronet were only added several years later by Sultan Ismail.(1880 - 1944), resulting in its present form. Until 1916, Kelantan had no coat of arms.|$|R

5|$|The <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> {{legs are}} sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. They are {{attached}} {{to each of the}} three thoracic segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs. The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of {{treeshrews}} is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> lower incisors {{are included in the}} toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
