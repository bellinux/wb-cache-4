5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E
5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> type with the highest priority is included. Knowing <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E

While {{running through}} the castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that fall from <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> The sizes and shapes of fall streaks {{are determined by the}} wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Clouds is {{a native}} {{operating}} system for a distributed environment. <b>The</b> <b>Clouds</b> operating system is built {{on top of a}} kernel called Ra. Ra ís a second generation kernel derived from our experience with the first version of <b>the</b> <b>Clouds</b> operating system. Rø is a minimal, flexible kernel that provides a framework for implementing a variety of distributed operating systems. This paper presents <b>the</b> <b>Clouds</b> paradigm and a brief overview of its first implementation. We then present the details of the Rø kernel, the rationale for its design, and the system services that constitute <b>the</b> <b>Clouds</b> operating system...|$|R

5|$|In 2273, a Starfleet {{monitoring}} station, Epsilon Nine, detects {{an alien}} force, {{hidden in a}} massive cloud of energy, moving through space towards Earth. <b>The</b> <b>cloud</b> destroys three of the Klingon Empire's new K't'inga-class warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> entity as the ship {{is the only one}} in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> layer.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{stars in}} these groups may powerfully {{illuminate}} those clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> and prevent further star formation.|$|E

5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side.

In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. <b>The</b> <b>cloud</b> obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road.

5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer.
