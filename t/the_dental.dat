5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth.

5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw.

After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. <b>The</b> <b>dental</b> service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians are polyphyodonts {{and able}} to replace each of their {{approximately}} 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan. They are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets. Next to each full-grown tooth {{there is a small}} replacement tooth and an odontogenic stem cell in <b>the</b> <b>dental</b> lamina in standby, which can be activated when required. Tooth replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as the animal grows old.|$|E
5|$|Denmark Hill Campus is {{situated}} in south London near {{the borders of the}} London Borough of Lambeth and the London Borough of Southwark in Camberwell and is the only campus not situated on the River Thames. The campus consists of King's College Hospital, the Maudsley Hospital and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN). In addition to the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, parts of <b>the</b> <b>Dental</b> Institute and School of Medicine, and a large hall of residence, King's College Hall, are situated here. Other buildings include the campus library known as the Weston Education Centre (WEC), the James Black Centre, the Rayne Institute (haemato-oncology) and the Cicely Saunders Institute (palliative care).|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of <b>the</b> <b>dental</b> pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of <b>the</b> <b>dental</b> occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. <b>The</b> <b>dental</b> caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, <b>the</b> <b>dental</b> effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

The school further merged with the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in 1998.|$|E

50|$|The ASDS {{remained}} <b>the</b> only national <b>dental</b> organization from 1840 to 1856, when {{controversy over}} <b>the</b> use of <b>dental</b> amalgam {{led to its}} demise.

In 1859, a year before his death, another national <b>dental</b> organization, <b>the</b> American <b>Dental</b> Association, was established during a meeting in Niagara, New York. Before 1861 dentists were participant in both the ADC and the ADA, which promoted education and research in all aspects of dentistry, including dental materials and remained active throughout the American Civil War (1861—1865). However, during the war, Southern dentists withdrew from the ADC and the ADA and, in 1869, established <b>the</b> Southern <b>Dental</b> Association. <b>The</b> Southern <b>Dental</b> Association subsequently merged with the ADA in 1897 to form <b>the</b> National <b>Dental</b> Association (NDA). <b>The</b> NDA was renamed <b>the</b> American <b>Dental</b> Association (ADA) in 1922.|$|R
