25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E
25|$|There follow angry exchanges {{among the}} three, Norma declaring Pollione to be a traitor; {{he trying to}} persuade Adalgisa to leave with him; and she angrily telling him to go away. When he {{declares}} that it is his fate to leave Norma, she encourages the young priestess to go with him, but the latter declares that she would rather die. Norma then demands that her lover go, leaving behind his children—and his honour. (Finale: brief duet, Adalgisa and Pollione: he declares his love, and she her desire to Norma {{not to be the}} cause of grief to her. Trio: Norma continues to rage at Pollione, Adalgisa repeats her desire to make him return to Norma, and Pollione curses the day when he met Norma.) <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the Druids calling Norma to the temple is heard. They report that the angry god, Irminsul, has spoken. Pollione storms out.|$|E
2500|$|Sea Devil {{leveled off}} at [...] and rigged for depth charging. Twelve were counted; none was close. Escorts milled about {{overhead}} {{for the next}} 40minutes; <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of screws faded out. Pinging was heard for a while longer, and distant depth charges were heard for several hours.|$|E
5000|$|Ah-Un-Uh-Uh-Un (อ่างอึ่งอ๋องอ๋องอึ่ง) - 1221 (Ah {{means this}} {{password}} comes with Ah voice, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of this password is similar with One-Two-Two-One) ...|$|R
60|$|There were {{frequent}} stoppages, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> {{would begin}} again, always louder, always closer. Billy {{sat up in}} the blankets once more, passing one arm around Saxon, who had also sat up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't move!" [...] Dorle cried. The barrel swung {{past them}} as they stood, rigid and still. For one terrible moment it hesitated over their heads, {{clicking}} and whirring, settling into position. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> died out and the gun became silent.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of huntsmen {{is heard}} in the distance. Alaide {{urgently}} urges Arturo to leave. In the scene finale duet, the couple each expresses his or her feelings and anxieties, hers being to continue to warn him, his being to insist that [...] "your fate will be mine / In life or in death".|$|E
2500|$|The {{songs on}} Tormented are about {{topics such as}} pain, animosity, suicide and depression. Author Tommy Udo wrote: [...] "Tormented is one long rush of {{hardcore}} [...] a 900mph scream of a man smashing his head against a wall with frustration". Described as alternative metal by AllMusic, Tormented is also somewhat of a concept album that {{tells the story of}} a depressed person who eventually commits suicide. This is hinted by the spoken-word line, [...] "it's been like this forever... no more... I hate my fucking life", followed by the sound of a gun being cocked before the first song, [...] "Tolerate"; this thematic device returns with the line [...] "there's nothing left for me" [...] and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a gunshot immediately after the song [...] "Four Walls" [...] and before the hidden track [...] "Funeral".|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the pursuers was heard, as if {{searching the}} {{neighbouring}} thicket.|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{government}} and states couldn’t agree who controlled the Long Island and Block Island <b>sounds.</b> <b>The</b> states wanted control to regulate shipping and commerce on <b>the</b> <b>sounds.</b> <b>The</b> key to the case was if Long Island was, for legal purposes, {{an extension of the}} mainland or an island. If it were simply an extension of the mainland as <b>the</b> states argued, <b>then</b> under law <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> are inland bays controlled by the states. If it were an island for legal purposes, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> would be considered open waters under federal control.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{keep that}} monkey back, that's all the helpin' I want," [...] Ben replied, almost sharply, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> {{indicated}} that <b>the</b> cat had suddenly changed her position to one farther under the barn, while {{the boy was}} trying to frighten her out.|$|R
60|$|The tiger, for a time, roared loudly at intervals. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> became {{lower and}} less frequent, {{and at last}} ceased altogether. In vain did the natives above shower down crackers. In vain were the rockets {{discharged}} into the jungle. An hour passed, since he had last been heard.|$|R
60|$|A peal of {{laughter}} {{came from the}} drawing-room, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of chords struck on the piano.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{footsteps}} returning, {{this time at}} a walk. They passed the gate and went on down the road.|$|E
6000|$|A sudden {{chorus of}} wild alarms burst out far below--a pause--and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{grinding}} and crashing followed. Mr. Thornburg exclaimed-- ...|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{opinion was}} {{expressed}} by Rudolf Flesch {{in his famous}} 1955 book Why Johnny Can't Read. Flesch blamed sight-words for the increase of functional illiteracy in the US. Exponents of synthetic phonics argue that children must first learn <b>the</b> alphabet, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> represented by <b>the</b> letters, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> blends of those sounds, and that children should never memorize words as visual designs.|$|R
5000|$|Further changes <b>then</b> shifted <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{values of}} <b>the</b> {{unstressed}} syllables that had conditioned the above shift: ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we walked}} forward again, {{we passed through}} a thick {{plantation}} of young firs; and <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> behind us became slowly and solemnly deadened the further we went on. When we {{had arrived at the}} extremity of the line of trees, they ceased softly and suddenly. It was like a change in a dream.|$|R
60|$|And just <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{of voices}} reached them, and looking {{forth from the}} {{verandah}} they saw Huish and the captain drawing near.|$|E
60|$|As {{they moved}} along {{they heard the}} train go off, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the saw resumed its {{domination}} of the village noises.|$|E
6000|$|There was a moment's silence, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{of writing}} {{began in the}} middle of the table. When this had finished, I said, [...] "Did you succeed?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> died down, and {{the rocks}} no longer thundered past, {{and he saw}} his tribespeople {{creeping}} close and closer, spearing the wounded as they came. And near to him he heard the scuffle of a mighty Slavonian hunter, loath to die, and, half uprisen, borne back and down by the thirsty spears.|$|R

5|$|Memphis has {{previously}} hosted a major professional basketball {{team in the}} American Basketball Association (ABA).

6000|$|Again {{they were}} silent. A puff of wind ruffled the leaves; the night, for a moment, seemed full of whispering; <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a giggle jarred {{out and a}} girl's voice: ...|$|E
60|$|He did not speak, {{but looked}} at her with fixed, dumb eyes. And <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of distant voices and hurrying feet started her again into passionate life. She once more caught his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] a voice replied; and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of oars in {{the water}} told that the boat was leaving the harbor, {{probably}} steering for a tiny red light which could now be seen some distance off the land.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>the</b> {{hands were}} clasped, and no words but 'Thank you' {{would come to}} the young man's lips and <b>then,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{reminded}} him, he bowed his head, adding, 'Thank God!' ...|$|R
60|$|Hossein lay back, as if {{taking a}} sleep, and so {{remained}} until, {{half an hour}} later, he heard the shouts of the drivers to the women, to take their places in the carts. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of retreating wheels was heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate Aunt Augusta," [...] he said aloud; and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{his voice}} in that huge, still room scared him so that he only thought the rest. [...] "I won't have any fun--and she won't feed my gobbler, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] cried a boatman, and [...] "Shut up, you fool!" [...] {{said a man}} near me to a yelping dog. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> came again, {{this time}} from the {{direction}} of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> came <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of that lusty cry {{of triumph}} from outside, {{followed}} {{by all the}} clatter and the breaking of window glass.|$|R
60|$|The door of {{the cell}} was shut and locked as quietly {{as it had been}} opened; <b>then</b> {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of footsteps crossing the floor.|$|R
60|$|The others, {{who were}} in the same predicament, leaned over the side, listening. The {{swimmers}} were invisible in the darkness, but their progress was easily followed by the noise they made.
