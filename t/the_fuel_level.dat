5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{corrosion}} {{the fuel}} {{system must be}} made of suitable materials, electrical wires must be properly insulated and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.|$|E

The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open.

25|$|The {{effects of}} varying the {{characteristics}} of the dielectric can be used for sensing purposes. Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases. Squeezing the dielectric can change a capacitor at a few tens of bar pressure sufficiently that it {{can be used as a}} pressure sensor. A selected, but otherwise standard, polymer dielectric capacitor, when immersed in a compatible gas or liquid, can work usefully as a very low cost pressure sensor up to many hundreds of bar.|$|E

The B1 model has a fuel sender with a round tank mounting, the B2 has a rectangular mounting plate, therefore the tanks are different also. The DFI fuel delivery hardware appears to be the same.

5000|$|In a {{vertical}} float system a permanent magnet {{is mounted on}} the surface of a floating object. The current carrying conductor is fixed {{on the top of the}} tank lining up with the magnet. When the level of fuel rises, an increasing magnetic field is applied on the current resulting in higher Hall voltage. As <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> decreases, the Hall voltage will also decrease. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is indicated and displayed by proper signal condition of Hall voltage.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, {{the level of}} fuel carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate fuel level of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by a float switch in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|E

40|$|Road {{transportation}} {{is a big}} contributor to the existing CO 2 emissions, among other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants. The amount of emitted pollutants by a vehicle depends on <b>the</b> amount of <b>fuel</b> consumed and <b>the</b> type of <b>fuel</b> utilised. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption <b>level</b> is dependent on distance, load, speed, road gradient, driving pattern and many more factors. This paper extends vehicle routing problem (VRP) literature by developing a new variant as a green routing problem (GRP) which deals with optimising CO 2 emissions and costs from a bi-fuel vehicle fleet, which runs on both <b>the</b> main <b>fuel</b> and <b>the</b> cleaner alternative <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> modelling approach deals with not only <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption <b>level,</b> {{but also with the}} optimised utilisation of <b>the</b> alternative <b>fuel</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle. To analyse environmental and economic performance of the GRP, two extensions as P-GRP and CB-GRP were developed and implemented in an Iranian case study, with a bi-fuel (gasoline/CNG) fleet. Results of the case study and computational experiments suggest a possible reduction in CO 2 emissions by up to 27. 38 % and in costs by up to 18. 76 %, when compared with CVRP with a simple distance minimisation objective, using the conventional gasoline as <b>the</b> <b>fuel...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the capital requirements of using six different <b>fuels</b> in <b>the</b> vehicles with tripled fuel economy (3 X vehicles) that the Partnership for a new Generation of Vehicles is currently investigating. <b>The</b> six <b>fuels</b> include two petroleum-based fuels (reformulated gasoline and low-sulfur diesel) and four alternative fuels (methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, and hydrogen).

Two <b>levels</b> of <b>fuel</b> volume- 70, 000 barrels per day and 1. 6 million barrels per day-were established for meeting 3 X-vehicle fuel demand. As expected, infrastructure capital needs for <b>the</b> high <b>fuel</b> demand <b>level</b> are much higher than for <b>the</b> low <b>fuel</b> demand <b>level.</b> Between <b>fuel</b> production infrastructure and distribution infrastructure, capital needs for the former far exceed those for the latter.

30|$|<b>Fuel</b> {{moisture}} <b>levels</b> were manipulated {{in order}} to measure <b>the</b> effects of <b>fuel</b> moisture on fire behavior. Three different levels of fine-fuel moisture were chosen to represent a) completely dry fuels (0 % <b>fuel</b> moisture), b) <b>the</b> minimum allowable <b>fuel</b> moisture in typical southern Ohio fire prescriptions (4 % fuel moisture), and c) <b>the</b> maximum allowable <b>fuel</b> moisture in <b>the</b> same fire prescriptions (15 % fuel moisture) (Mike Bowden, pers. comm.; Iverson et al. 2004).

50|$|As {{the landing}} gear was being lowered on {{approach}} to Portland International Airport, the crew felt an abnormal vibration and yaw of the aircraft {{as well as a}} lack of an indicator light showing the gear was lowered unsuccessfully. The crew requested a holding pattern to diagnose the problem, and for approximately the next hour the crew worked to identify the status of {{the landing gear}} and prepare for a potential emergency landing. During this time, none of the three cockpit flight crew effectively monitored <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>levels,</b> which was exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} gear was down with the flaps at 15 degrees during the entire hour-long holding maneuver, significantly increasing fuel burn rate. As the crew prepared for a final approach for an emergency landing into Portland, they lost the number one and number two engines to flameout, at which point a Mayday was declared. This was the last radio transmission from Flight 173 to Air Traffic Control. The plane crashed into a wooded section of a populated area of suburban Portland about 6 nautical miles southeast of the airport.|$|R
30|$|Although bunker {{cost savings}} {{is a major}} {{incentive}} for slow-steaming, the impact of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> price <b>level</b> alone is not as salient as one might suspect because fuel surcharges, or bunker adjustment factor (BAF), distort the economic signal that <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> price provides to shipowners in regard to sailing speed (ibid). BAF is a contractual construct that transfers <b>the</b> risk of <b>fuel</b> price fluctuations from the shipowner to the shipper. This means that even when fuel prices are extremely high and bunker {{accounts for more than}} 60 % of the shipowners total cost (UNCTAD, 2008), the shipowners might opt to retain high speeds as long as the underlying demand for the service is strong (Fransoo & Lee, 2013; Wang et al., 2011).|$|R

As a result, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and eventually crashed. A similar incident occurred on December 28, 1978, when the captain of United Airlines Flight 173 was distracted by a landing-gear issue and did not heed his crewmembers' concerns about <b>the</b> aircraft's <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in an exhaustion of fuel to all engines and a subsequent crash.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} synthesizing hier-archical controllers for discrete-time switched affine systems subject to exogenous disturbances that guarantee that the trajectories of the system satisfy a high-level specification expressed as a linear temporal logic formula. Our method builds upon recent results on temporal logic planning and embedded controller synthesis. First, the control problem is lifted to a discrete level by constructing a finite transition system that abstracts {{the behavior of the}} underlying switched system. At the discrete level, we recast the problem as a two player temporal logic game by treating the environment driven switches as adversaries. The solution strategy for the game (i. e. the discrete plan) is then implemented at the continuous level by solving finite-horizon optimal control problems that establish reachability between discrete states and that compensate the effects of continuous disturbances. We also extend the earlier work by making efficient use of propositions in the temporal logic formula to drive the abstraction procedure and to facilitate the computation of continuous input at implementation time. An aircraft fuel system example is formulated; and solved using the proposed method. This sample problem demonstrates the applicability of the abstraction procedure and correct-by-construction controllers to regulate <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> in multiple tanks during interesting operations like aerial refueling.
