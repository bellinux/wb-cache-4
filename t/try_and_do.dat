5|$|After local {{businessman}} Paul Robinson {{is pushed}} from Lassiter's mezzanine, Mark {{is placed in}} charge of the investigation. He goes to the crime scene and then to the hospital to speak with Paul's wife, Rebecca. Mark learns Paul made several enemies before the attempt on his life and Diana Marshall becomes the prime suspect. Mark questions several Erinsborough residents, including Paul's son, Andrew, and Kate Ramsay, who gives Rebecca an alibi. When Andrew tries to help the investigation along, Mark warns him not to <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> his job for him. Paul wakes up from his coma and implies that Diana pushed him. She flees the country. Weeks later, Mark asks Kate out to dinner and after initially turning him down, she agrees. Their date is interrupted by Declan and Kate leaves. Declan and Mark later fight over Kate, but she is only interested in Mark. After Kate confronts Mark about making threats towards Declan, they break up. Kate learns Declan was lying and she apologises to Mark. She kisses him in front of his colleagues, making him realise that she is worth the risk. Mark tells Kate that he needs to solve Paul's case to prove himself to his superiors, but he decides that {{he does not want to}} sacrifice their relationship and he gives up the case.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{was written by}} Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. Unlike {{previous}} Grand Theft Auto games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, [...] " [...] really have any cinematic influences", as explained by Houser. [...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie.

500|$|John Brown was 20 at {{the time}} of the attack and served a {{sentence}} for affray for his role in the rioting. He was a member of the Park Lane Crew, a Tottenham gang that he said Jacobs had also joined. Approached by police again during Nove's second inquiry, Brown said in a statement in August 1993 that Jacobs was a [...] "nutter" [...] who was [...] "out to get blood" [...] that night. He said Jacobs had [...] "broadcast it everywhere that he was going to <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a copper," [...] and that the Park Lane Crew had stored weapons and petrol bombs in preparation for such an attack. Brown admitted to having kicked Blakelock up to ten times, and said that he had seen Jacobs attack Blakelock with a machete or similar.|$|E

They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bono was {{influenced}} by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of [...] "Acrobat", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of one of his short stories, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book [...] "was on my mind when I was writing the words... It's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines, but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist... I'm the opposite. I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of , and that's why I enjoy him." [...] The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989. He noted that the beat is unusual for a U2 song, saying it [...] "was the jumping off point, to <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something with an unusual beat." ...|$|E

Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E

Chibnall, Marsters and {{producer}} Richard Stokes discuss the role of [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] in developing John's character and placing him on a redemptive path. Marsters felt the character to be on a [...] "journey" [...] whilst Chibnall deliberately played upon the question of [...] "can you trust him, or can't you?" [...] Stokes commented that the character isn't the [...] "selfish and anarchic" [...] character seen in [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and that his [...] "affection and love for Captain Jack are enough to make him <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the noble thing". Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on Doctor Who and its spin-offs, notes that because of the reluctance of Hart's collaboration with Gray and his remorse for his actions the episode leaves the audience [...] "a little more favourably disposed" [...] towards the character. In April 2008 Marsters indicated that he expected to return to Torchwood in the near future. He later expressed a desire to be part of Torchwoods fourth series after it was revealed the show would be largely produced in Los Angeles.|$|E

Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control.

We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory.

Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning.
