5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate to remove <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> from the City, especially the upper class. This provided {{a source of}} income for the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats.

At the camp at Jamalabad fort, Mangalorean Catholic leaders were thrown down from the fort. All Christian churches in South Canara, except the Hospet Church at Hospet and the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, were razed {{to the ground and}} all land owned by the captured Christians was taken over by Tipu and distributed among his favourites. After they were freed, all <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> had disappeared and their deserted lands were cultivated by the Bunts.|$|E

Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E

It became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central (WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year surpassed Enron's bankruptcy so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs. The day that Enron {{filed for bankruptcy}}, the employees were told to pack <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building. Nearly 62% of 15,000 employees' savings plans relied on Enron stock that was purchased at $83 in early 2001 and was now practically worthless.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover <b>their</b> <b>belongings.</b> Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E

5|$|In Haiti, about 630,000 {{people were}} still living in tents across areas devastated by the January 2010 {{earthquake}} prior to Emily's arrival. Due {{to the lack of}} sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands of people at the risk of flooding. Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard <b>their</b> <b>belongings.</b> The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted. In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and landing sites in country.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away <b>their</b> <b>belongings</b> and {{traveled}} to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep.

As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
