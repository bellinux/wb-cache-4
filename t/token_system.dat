5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one train on each section of the line so the line was not built with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a <b>token</b> <b>system</b> using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{of the staff}} and ticket system {{is that it is}} very inflexible. If a locomotive fails in a station, for example, a token staff may be at the wrong end of a section and will have to be moved by road. This situation does not occur under the Electric <b>Token</b> <b>System</b> (ETS), a more advanced system in which tokens can be obtained at either end of a section from a token instrument.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{as early}} as 4000 BCE, people were trading livestock, tools, and other items. In Sumer, an early civilization in Mesopotamia, a <b>token</b> <b>system</b> {{was one of the}} first forms of {{commodity}} money. Labor markets consist of workers, employers, wages, income, supply and demand. Labor markets have been around as long as commodity markets. The first labor markets provided workers to grow crops and tend livestock for later sale in local markets. Capital markets emerged in industries that require resources beyond those of an individual farmer.|$|E
50|$|Walker (1990) {{presents}} {{an overview of}} <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> and combining such procedures with other interventions in the classroom. He relates the comprehensiveness of <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> to the child's level of difficulty.|$|R
50|$|One form of {{contingency}} management is the <b>token</b> economy <b>system.</b> <b>Token</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be used}} in an individual or group format. <b>Token</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been shown to be}} successful with a diverse array of populations including those suffering from addiction, those with special needs, and delinquents. However, recent research questions the use of <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> with very young children. The exception to the last would be the treatment of stuttering. The goal of such systems is to gradually thin out and to help the person begin to access the natural community of reinforcement (the reinforcement typically received in the world for performing the behavior).|$|R
40|$|Token economies {{have been}} shown {{effective}} and useful within behaviour analysis and general educational literature. However, despite several recommendations {{for the use of}} token reinforcement within physical education and the documented effectiveness of <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> applied in physical activity settings, little research has examined these systems specifically within a physical education context. The following review examines the existing literature that applies <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> in physical activity situations. Based on the findings from these studies, paired with the recommended uses in physical education, it can be concluded that <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> may be a useful tool for physical educators. However, further research needs to be conducted, particularly in physical education settings. This review provides a rationale and an impetus for conducting such research...|$|R
500|$|In 2012, {{the temple}} {{administration}} introduced a <b>token</b> <b>system</b> {{for visitors to}} the temple. Tokens indicating the time of visit were provided from three stalls in the taxi stands. Each devotee to visit the presiding deity is allocated 10–20 seconds. Proof of identity is mandatory to enter the temple. The temple is reached from Rishikesh, located [...] away via Dev Prayag, Rudra Prayag, Karna Prayag, Nanda Prayag, Joshimutt, Vishnuprayag and Devadarshini. From Kedarnath, visitors can follow the -long Rudra Prayag route or the -long Ukthimath and Gopeswar route.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{its opening}} on 1 July 1880, the single line between [...] and Oban was worked by the {{electric}} <b>token</b> <b>system,</b> {{this being the}} first ever application of that system in everyday service.|$|E

40|$|Token {{reinforcement}} {{procedures and}} concepts are reviewed and discussed {{in relation to}} general principles of behavior. The paper is divided into four main parts. Part I reviews and discusses previous research on <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> in relation to common behavioral functions—reinforcement, temporal organization, antecedent stimulus functions, and aversive control—emphasizing both the continuities with other contingencies and the distinctive features of <b>token</b> <b>systems.</b> Part II describes the role of token procedures in the symmetrical law of effect, the view that reinforcers (gains) and punishers (losses) {{can be measured in}} conceptually analogous terms. Part III considers the utility of token reinforcement procedures in cross-species analysis of behavior more generally, showing how token procedures can be used to bridge the methodological gulf separating research with humans from that with other animals. Part IV discusses the relevance of <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> to the field of behavioral economics. <b>Token</b> <b>systems</b> have the potential to significantly advance research and theory in behavioral economics, permitting both a more refined analysis of the costs and benefits underlying standard economic models, and a common currency more akin to human monetary systems. Some implications for applied research and for broader theoretical integration across disciplines will also be considered. Key words: token reinforcement, conditioned reinforcement, symmetrical law of effect, cross-species analysis, behavioral economics _______________________________________________________________________________ A token is an object or symbol that is exchanged for goods or services. Tokens, in the form of clay coins, first appeared in human history in the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural societies, and the expansion from simple barter economies to more complex economies (Schmandt-Bes-serat, 1992). Since that time, <b>token</b> <b>systems,</b> in one form or another, have provided the basic economic framework for all monetary transac-tions. From the supermarket to the stock market, any economic system of exchange involves some form of <b>token</b> reinforcement. <b>Token</b> <b>systems</b> have been successfully em-ployed as behavior-management and motiva-tional tools in educational and rehabilitative settings since at least the early 1800 s (se...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of a <b>token</b> economy <b>system</b> in comparison to social praise on the manifest behaviors of learning disabled students at an elementary school in West Virginia. The null hypothesis of this study was that there would be no significant difference between a <b>token</b> economy <b>system</b> in comparison to social praise on the manifest behaviors of learning disabled students. The following research question was examined in this study: What are the effects of a <b>token</b> economy <b>system</b> in comparison to social praise on the manifest behaviors of learning disabled students? Literature relevant to this study revealed that a <b>token</b> economy <b>system</b> can be an effective method for changing or controlling student behavior (Mathur, 1996; Rhode, Morgan, & Young, 1983; Turkewitz, O’Leary, & Ironsmith, 1975; DeMartini-Scully, 2000). Some cautions suggested in the study were also noted. <b>Token</b> economy <b>systems</b> can be time-consuming and costly (Lovitt, 1978). Further research revealed that a strategy that may be effective in a <b>token</b> economy <b>system</b> is to fade away from the constant reinforcing with tangible rewards and have students monitor their own performance (Rhode, Morgan, & Young, 1983; Turkewitz, O’Leary...|$|R
50|$|A similar method, {{known as}} 'Telegraph and Crossing Order' was used on some busy single {{lines in the}} UK during the 19th century. However, a series of head-on {{collisions}} resulted from authority to proceed being wrongly given or misunderstood by the train crew - the worst {{of which was the}} collision between Norwich and Brundall, Norfolk, in 1874. As a result, the system was phased out in favour of <b>token</b> <b>systems.</b> This eliminated the danger of ambiguous or conflicting instructions being given because <b>token</b> <b>systems</b> rely on objects to give authority, rather than verbal or written instructions; whereas {{it is very difficult to}} completely prevent conflicting orders being given, it is relatively simple to prevent conflicting tokens being handed out.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>token</b> <b>system</b> was {{implemented}} {{as a means}} of preventing people from playing excessively. Higher leveled or excessive battles cost [...] "tokens" [...] to enter, which gradually increases as more battles are performed. Tokens are restocked on certain days of the week. Alternatively, special tokens may be purchased from the cash shop which provides slightly better benefits than normal tokens. The <b>token</b> <b>system</b> was eventually phased out in the North American version, was not released directly in the European version, and had been replaced with a Fatigue system in the Korean version.|$|E

50|$|Not all blocks are {{controlled}} using fixed signals.

50|$|Developments in {{electronic}} systems {{have led to}} the development of electronic <b>token</b> <b>systems.</b> Trains are able to run over consecutive single-track sections, with the operation being controlled by radio from a central control room. Every train carries an electronic unit that receives and sends an encrypted block of data which represents the <b>token.</b> The <b>system</b> is designed so that the control centre cannot issue a new token for a section of line until the current one is 'returned'. Trains cannot send tokens to each other. This system allows the whole line to operate without any additional signalling personnel, and has functioned without major incident.|$|R
