The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with whips as they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of whips and swords, they faint and cry out for help in vain.|$|E

5|$|The {{video of}} the song {{features}} {{the majority of the}} film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E

More exotic designs such as nanokernels and exokernels are available, but are seldom used for production systems. The Xen hypervisor, for example, is an exokernel.|$|E

Catherine stays with the Lintons. The Lintons are landed gentry and Catherine is {{influenced}} by their elegant appearance and genteel manners. When she returns to Wuthering Heights, her appearance and manners are more ladylike, and she laughs at Heathcliff's unkempt appearance.

Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader {{of one of the}} Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about, saying [...] "Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> off with the story." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Montana sapphires {{were heavily}} mined during [...] for {{industrial}} abrasive and cutting purposes. However, because the Yogo mines were still {{owned by the}} English, the United States government could not control those operations, so the mines were little affected by the war, even though industrial sapphires were critical to the war effort. The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation of Billings, Montana, was the next company to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the English Mine. They made an initial offer in 1946, and reached a deal by 1949. However, the purchase was not complete until 1956 because of legal issues. The sale was finally completed for $65,000 cash and some stock considerations because the company's capital was exhausted, similar to previous Yogo ventures. The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation then {{changed its name to}} be the same as the former English firm's name: New Mine Sapphire Syndicate. It became informally known as the [...] "American Syndicate" [...] to distinguish it from the previous [...] "English Syndicate". Production was poor and mining ceased in September 1959. From 1959 to 1963, the mine itself was left unattended and unsecured, resulting in hobbyists, picnickers, and rockhounds' coming from all over the US and Canada to gather loose rough sapphires. The American Syndicate took action to stop this in 1963, with fences and threats of prosecution. The American Syndicate then tried leasing the mine to several operators. One of these was Siskon, Inc. of Nevada, which lost a significant amount of money. They sued, and in May 1965 the Montana Supreme Court ruled in Siskon's favor. Siskon bought the mine at a sheriff's sale and in turn leased it to a group headed by Arnold Baron, who had a background in gemcutting and jewelry. Baron organized German and Thai gemcutters and had success in marketing Yogos in America—the first such success in 50 years. However, owing to the difficulty in mining the hard rock site, he did not exercise his option to buy the mine, and Siskon sold it in August 1968 to Herman Yaras of Oxnard, California, for $585,000.|$|E

2500|$|As well as contesting marks {{with their}} strength, full {{forwards}} will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> into space {{to shake off}} their defender and take an uncontested mark (this is known as [...] "leading", [...] "leading for the ball" [...] or [...] "leading into space"). This means that the full forward needs to be fast, but only in short bursts. In modern times, some teams have experimented by playing a smaller and faster player (possibly a former forward pocket or flanker) at full forward in order to beat the defender with speed rather than strength. In the case of Mark Williams (Hawthorn) and Brad Johnson (Western Bulldogs), this has been extremely successful.|$|E
