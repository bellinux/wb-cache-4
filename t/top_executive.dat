5|$|The mayor, {{based at}} the Primate's Palace, is the city's <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> officer and is elected to a {{four-year}} term of office. The current mayor of Bratislava is Ivo Nesrovnal, who won the election held on November 15, 2014 as an independent candidate. The city council is the city's legislative body, responsible for issues such as budget, local ordinances, city planning, road maintenance, education, and culture. The Council usually convenes once a month and consists of 45 members elected to four-year terms concurrent with the mayor's. Many of the council's executive functions are {{carried out by the}} city commission at the council's direction. The city board is a 28-member body composed of the mayor and his deputies, the borough mayors, and up to ten city council members. The board is an executive and supervisory arm of the city council and also serves in an advisory role to the mayor.|$|E
5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E
40|$|Academic {{research}} on <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> {{in general is}} rare, {{and even more so}} for German <b>top</b> <b>executives.</b> This paper examines the existence and size of top executive-specific effects on company performance and policy. In addition, the effects of industry-, company-, and executive-level factors that potentially moderate the influence of <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> on their companies are analyzed. Based on a review of the theoretical and empirical literature, a set of hypotheses is derived and tested using a unique dataset including 110 large publicly listed German companies and 459 German <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> from 1983 to 2002. The results indicate that German <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> do matter for organizational outcomes and that their impact on their organization is comparatively large. Moreover, several industry- and company-level factors that influence the ability of <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> to shape their companies are detected. Finally, practical implications of the results are discussed. Keywords: Chief executive officer, chief financial officers, corporate governance, Finanzvorstand...|$|R

25|$|After the coup, Assad was {{appointed}} Minister of Defense. This {{was his first}} cabinet post, and through his position he would be thrust into {{the forefront of the}} Syrian–Israeli conflict. His government was radically socialist, and sought to remake society from top to bottom. Although Assad was a radical, he opposed the headlong rush for change. Despite his title, he had little power in the government and took more orders than he issued. Jadid was the undisputed leader at the time, opting to remain in the office of Assistant Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command instead of taking executive office (which had historically been held by Sunnis). Nureddin al-Atassi was given three of the four <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> positions in the country: President, Secretary-General of the National Command and Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command. The post of prime minister was given to Yusuf Zu'ayyin. Jadid (who was establishing his authority) focused on civilian issues and gave Assad de facto control of the Syrian military, considering him no threat.|$|E

40|$|First version: May 2015, This version: June 2016 本研究は経営者の在職期間と損失回避を意図した利益調整との関係を分析している．主たる発見事項は次の通りである．ひとつは，経営者の在職期間と会計発生高による損失回避との間には統計的に有意な関係はない．いまひとつは，就任間もない経営者ほど損失を回避するために支出を裁量的に削減する．これらの検証に加えて，本研究ではどのようなコーポレート・ガバナンス・メカニズムが経営者の機会主義的行動を抑制するのかについても分析を行った．分析の結果，機関投資家持株比率が高い企業ほど就任間もない経営者が損失回避を意図した利益調整を行う可能性は低下するのに対して，社外取締役比率が高くとも経営者による機会主義的行動は抑制されないことが明らかとなった．これらの結果は，日本の経営者はキャリア・コンサーンの問題から損失回避を意図した利益調整を行うこと，および機関投資家といったガバナンス・システムが経営者の機会主義的行動を抑制することを示唆している．We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between the tenure of <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> and earnings management to avoid loss. The main findings are as follows. First, there is no statistically significant relation between their tenure and loss avoidance through accruals. Second, the probability that <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> discretionally cut expenditures such as R&D and advertising expenditures to avoid loss is higher {{in the early years of}} their service than in the later years. This study also analyzes which corporate governance mechanism is able to restrain such opportunistic behavior. The results indicate that the practice of earnings management by <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> to avoid loss in the early years of their service decreases with institutional ownership. However, it does not vary with the proportion of outside directors on the board. These findings suggest that although Japanese <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> manage earnings to avoid loss out of concern for their careers, a governance mechanism involving institutional investors is likely to inhibit their opportunistic behavior...|$|R

During the period, the overall gender gap in compensation for <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> and potential <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> decreased from 35 percent to 31 percent. However, contrary to many other studies, we do not find that {{the gender gap}} for Danish <b>top</b> <b>executives</b> disappears when controlling for observed individual and firm characteristics and unobserved individual heterogeneity. For CEOs, the raw compensation gap is 28 percent during the period while the estimated compensation gap after controlling for observed and unobserved characteristics increases to 30 percent. For executives below the CEO level, the estimated compensation gap is lower, ranging from 15 to 20 percent. Thus, we find evidence of both glass ceilings and sticky floors in Danish private firms.
