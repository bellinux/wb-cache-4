5|$|As dusk {{approached}} and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared {{they could be}} flanked at any time. He planned to pull his men back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E

Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the British guns, {{advancing}} along <b>the</b> road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> issued into <b>the</b> open {{and checked the}} pursuit of the Americans by a well-directed fire.

The two guns were recaptured, with two others.|$|R

5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E
5|$|Brigade Headquarters was {{attacked}} by a force of Germans that had infiltrated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Informed of the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, the commanding officer of 9th Parachute Battalion, collected 'C' Company, his own headquarters staff and a small group armed with captured German MG 42 machine-guns. They approached the Germans from the rear and trapped them in a crossfire, killing nineteen and capturing one. That afternoon two infantry platoons attacked 'A' Company, but were fought off by a counter-attack from 'C' Company's position.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, {{from which it}} was {{possible}} at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E

5|$|Mardas {{was jealous}} about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and {{during one of}} their {{frequent}} walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> he asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating {{a large part of}} their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi's teachings to the whole of India.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{for more than two}} kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pilot remained unaired, {{although some}} footage {{from the original}} pilot {{was used in the}} first aired episode.

That scene is one of a few to be filmed on 35 mm film, and consequently slight film grain {{can be seen in the}} HD version of the episode.|$|E

There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E
5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes a central figure in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is last heard of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|On the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{on both sides of}} the road between the hamlet of Asch and Stockach. A third charge succeeded in taking the road, but the Austrian forces reformed the line and the artillery, now at the head of a wedge, bombarded the French troops. In a bayonet charge, the French took the hamlet of Wahlweiss, but Ferino's troops could not hold it and withdrew during the night. Jourdan then ordered a general withdrawal from the region, instructing his divisions to retreat along the lines of march they had followed into the region, and himself establishing a command post at Hornberg. He sent the cavalry to the western side of the Black Forest, where the horses could expect to find better forage.|$|E
