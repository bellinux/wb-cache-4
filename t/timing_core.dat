This {{research}} project investigates innovative digital start-ups. A life-story approach, in which founders narrate their experiences, meanings and wisdom, is widely acknowledged {{as a method}} of entrepreneurial learning. The Sunrise Conference in which some of Australia's most successful digital entrepreneurs narrated the early days of their start-up journeys provided a rich pool of data. These narratives are supplemented with in-depth, semi-structured interviews to build twelve case studies. Insights are generated from the founders' perspectives of their success, especially at the early stage that they often refer to as 'traction'. This knowledge is combined with received theory in entrepreneurship and modern practitioners' literature to propose 'TrAction'. The framework consists of 1. Setting a trajectory for success with vision, purpose, focus, <b>timing,</b> <b>core</b> values and powering it with founding team skills; and then 2. Taking actions to achieve product-market fit driven by user experience while excelling in branding, 'growth marketing' and constantly tracking performance in essential metrics. This study lays the foundation for more research in an emerging yet vital sector for the Australian economy. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (viii, 90 pages...|$|E

40|$|Geochemical {{models of}} core {{formation}} are commonly based on core and mantle abundances of siderophile elements that partitioned between silicate and metal in a magma ocean {{in the early}} Earth. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that may provide constraints on the pressure, temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity conditions, and on the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> formation in the Earth. Previous experimental studies suggest that pressure exerts little to no influence over W metal-silicate partitioning up to 24 GPa, and indicate that the stronger influences are temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity. However, core formation models {{based in part on}} W, predict metal-silicate equilibration pressures outside the available experimental pressure range, requiring extrapolation of parameterized models. Therefore, higher pressure experimental data on W were needed to constrain this important parameter...|$|R
40|$|Impulsive choice {{behavior}} {{incorporates the}} psychological mechanisms {{involved in the}} processing of the anticipated magnitude and delay until reward. The goal of the present experiment {{was to determine whether}} individual differences in such processes related to individual differences in impulsive choice behavior. Two groups of rats (Delay Group and Magnitude Group) were initially exposed to an impulsive choice task with choices between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) rewards. The Delay Group was subsequently exposed to a temporal discrimination task followed by a progressive interval task, whereas the Magnitude Group was exposed to a reward magnitude sensitivity task followed by a progressive ratio task. Inter-task correlations revealed that the rats in the Delay Group that made more self-controlled (LL) choices also displayed lower standard deviations in the temporal bisection task and greater delay tolerance in the progressive interval task. Impulsive choice behavior in the Magnitude Group did not display any substantial correlations with the reward magnitude sensitivity and progressive ratio tasks. The results indicate the importance of <b>core</b> <b>timing</b> processes in impulsive choice behavior, and encourage further research examining the effects of changes in <b>core</b> <b>timing</b> processes on impulsive choice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the influence of <b>timing</b> and <b>core</b> recontouring on the retention strength of cast post and cores luted with composite resin cement. Materials and Methods: Forty single-rooted teeth were sectioned 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction. Root canals were fabricated and luted with composite resin cement. The specimens were equally divided into 4 groups. Two groups received core recontouring using a high-speed hand-piece. The other two groups were left uncountoured and served as control. Tensile force was used to separate the posts from the root canals with an Instron testing machine. Statistical analysis was carried out using two-way ANOVA and the Student’s t-test. Results: Post retention of the contoured groups at 15 minutes and 1 hour revealed a significant reduction compared to the uncontoured groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Post and cores that were not subjected to core recontouring exhibited significant greater post retention than those of contoured cores at 15 minutes and at 1 hour after cementation.

40|$|Tungsten is {{important}} in constraining core formation of the Earth because this element is a moderately siderophile element (depleted ~ 10 relative to chondrites) and, {{as a member of}} the Hf-W isotopic system, it is useful in constraining the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> formation. A number of previous experimental studies have been carried out to determine the silicate solubility and metal-silicate partitioning behavior of W, including its concomitant oxidation state. However, results of previous studies are inconsistent on whether W occurs as W(4 +) or W(6 +). It is assumed that W(4 +) is the cation valence relevant to core formation. Given the sensitivity to silicate composition of high valence cations, knowledge of the oxidation state of W over a wide range of fO 2 is critical to understanding the oxidation state of the mantle and core formation processes. This study seeks to measure the W valence and change in valence state over the range of fO 2 most relevant to core formation, around IW- 2...|$|R

Such insights are {{a direct result of}} the unprecedented data from space missions CoRoT and Kepler as well as recent theoretical advances. Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled with asteroseismology, binaries provide two independent methods to obtain masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially offer very robust characterization of these systems. Until recently, only one case has been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlate the detected red-giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find possible candidate systems. Light-curve modeling and mean properties measured from asteroseismology are combined to yield specific measurements of periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse <b>timing</b> variations, <b>core</b> rotation rates, and red-giant evolutionary state. After using three different techniques to eliminate false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red-giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 strong candidates (12 previously unknown) to be eclipsing binaries...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{requirement}} of high performance computing at low {{power can be}} met by the parallel execution of an application on a possibly large number of programmable cores. However, the lack of accurate timing properties may prevent parallel execution from being applicable to time-critical applications. We illustrate how this problem has been addressed by suitably designing the architecture, implementation, and programming model, of the Kalray MPPA®- 256 single-chip many-core processor. The MPPA®- 256 (Multi-Purpose Processing Array) processor integrates 256 processing engine (PE) cores and 32 resource management (RM) cores on a single 28 nm CMOS chip. These VLIW cores are distributed across 16 compute clusters and 4 I/O subsystems, each with a locally shared memory. On-chip communication and synchronization are supported by an explicitly addressed dual network-on-chip (NoC), with one node per compute cluster and 4 nodes per I/O subsystem. Off-chip interfaces include DDR, PCI and Ethernet, and a {{direct access to the}} NoC for low-latency processing of data streams. The key architectural features that support time-critical applications are <b>timing</b> compositional <b>cores,</b> independent memory banks inside the compute clusters, and the data NoC whose guaranteed services are determined by network calculus.

This level of regulation affects virtually all aspects of circadian systems, from the <b>core</b> <b>timing</b> mechanism and input pathways that synchronize clocks to the environment and output pathways that control overt rhythmicity. We hypothesize that post-transcriptional control confers on circadian clocks enhanced robustness as well as the ability to adapt to different environments.

Deficit in neuromotor control of the core may be a remote contributing factor {{to the development of}} PFPS. Comparative evaluation of core and extensor mechanism muscle activation patterns between healthy group and patients involved by patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) in a stair stepping task is the aim of this study. Methods: In this non-randomized interventional study fifteen males with PFPS and fifteen asymptomatic controls participated. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of Vastusmedialisobliquus (VMO), Vastuslateralis (VL), Gluteus medius (GMED), Gluteus Maximus (GMAX), Internal oblique (IO) and Erector spinae (ES) were recorded and EMG onsets were assessed in both stepping up (SU) and down (SD). The time of foot contact determined by a foot switch. Results: During SU: Onset times of all muscles except, VL and ES in the controls were significantly less than PFPS group (P< 0. 05). In PFPS group the temporal sequence of ES, VL and VMO were different from control groups. During SD: Onset times of all muscles except, GMAX and ES in the control group were significantly less than PFP group (P< 0. 05). The sequence of muscle activity in both healthy and PFP groups were the same. Conclusion: Our findings are in line with previous researches about the effects of core on function and control of lower extremity. Activation patterns of core and vasti muscles are different between control and PFPS group during stair stepping task.

40|$|Measurements of the isotopic {{composition}} of tungsten (W) show that lunar samples and Martian meteorites have {{an excess of}} tungsten- 182. This was produced by the decay of hafnium- 182 (Hf- 182), an isotope with a half-life of only 9 million years. Because tungsten dissolves enthusiastically in metallic iron and hafnium does not, {{it is possible to}} use the abundance of W- 182 in rocks formed by melting of the silicate mantle as an indicator of the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> formation. However, the concentrations of Hf and W in rocky material can be affected by melting and crystallization, so we also need to know how each element concentrates in common minerals in the mantles of the Moon and Mars. The behavior of Hf has been studied experimentally, but this is not true of W. Kevin Righter (Johnson Space Center) and Charles (Chip) Shearer (University of New Mexico) have filled this knowledge void by determining how W partitions between olivine, high- and low-calcium pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar, and garnet. The new data allowed Righter and Shearer to reexamine available measurements of the {{isotopic composition}} of W in lunar samples and Martian meteorites. Their analysis suggests that the lunar magma ocean, a huge magma system that surrounded the Moon when it formed, solidified in less than 30 million years. This is shorter than many theoretical calculations suggest. Pathfinder data and chemical data from Martian meteorites suggest that the core of Mars makes up about 20 % of the planet. Core formation and subsequent melting of a region of the mantle containing garnet and high-calcium pyroxene took place less than 20 - 30 million years after the formation of the first solids in the solar system.

40|$|Protandry (prior {{emergence}} of males) in insect populations is usually {{considered to be}} the result of natural selection acting directly on eclosion timing. When females are monandrous (mate once), males in high density populations benefit from early emergence in the intense scramble competition for mates. In low density populations, however, scramble competition is reduced or absent, and theoretical models predict that protandry will be less favoured. This raises the question of how males behave in heterogeneous landscapes characterized by high density core populations in a low density continuum. We hypothesized that disadvantaged late emerging males in a core population would disperse to the continuum to find mates. We tested this idea using the protandrous, monandrous, pierid butterfly Anthocharis cardamines (the orange-tip) in a core population in Cheshire, northwest England. Over a six-year period, predicted male fitness (the number of matings a male can expect during his residence time, determined by the daily ratio of virgin females to competing males) consistently declined to < 1 in late season. This decline affected a large proportion (∼ 44 %) of males in the population and was strongly associated with decreased male recapture-rates, which we attribute to dispersal to the surrounding continuum. In contrast, reanalysis of mark-release-recapture data from an isolated population in Durham, northeast England, showed that in the absence of a continuum very few males (∼ 3 %) emerged when fitness declined to < 1 in late season. Hence the existence of a low density continuum may lead to the evolution of plastic dispersal behaviour in high density core populations, maintaining late emerging males which would otherwise be eliminated by selection. This has important theoretical consequences, since a truncated male emergence curve is a key prediction in game theoretic models of emergence timing which has so far received limited support. Our results have implications for conservation, since plastic dispersal behaviour in response to imperfect emergence <b>timing</b> in <b>core</b> (source) populations could help to maintain sink populations in heterogeneous landscapes which would otherwise be driven to extinction by low mate encounter-rates (Allee effects) ...|$|R
40|$|Geochemical {{models of}} core {{formation}} are commonly based on core and mantle abundances of siderophile elements. Because of the affinity {{of these elements}} for metallic phases, they {{are thought to be}} highly concentrated in Earth's core. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that may provide constraints on the pressure, temperature, composition, and oxygen fugacity conditions, and on the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> formation in the Earth. Previous experimental studies suggest that pressure exerts little influence over tungsten metal/silicate partitioning up to 20 gigapascals (GPa). But, core formation models, based on W, predict metal-silicate equilibration pressures outside the available experimental pressure range, thus, requiring extrapolation. Therefore, higher pressure experimental data on tungsten were needed to constrain this important parameter. High pressure melting experiments were conducted to 50 GPa and 4400 K using a diamond anvil cell, and to 26 GPa and 2500 K using a multi-anvil press. Diamond anvil cell samples were sectioned using a focused ion beam instrument. The W-WO 2 oxygen fugacity buffer was characterized to high pressure, also using diamond anvil cells and a multi-anvil press, combined with synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Combining the high pressure W-WO 2 oxygen fugacity buffer and the database of metal/silicate partitioning data, a new approach was taken to model the Fe-W exchange reaction. Compared to the common linear method of parameterizing metal-silicate partitioning data, this approach captures the non-linear pressure dependence on oxygen fugacity, and allows for modeling of the excess Gibbs energy of mixing based on the activity ratios of Fe, FeO, W, and WO 2. Applying this non-linear parameterization to the problem of core formation in the Earth, a pressure-temperature solution of 38 GPa and 3100 K in a peridotite silicate composition for a single-stage, magma ocean core formation model was determined that constrains equilibrium core formation conditions in the Earth. This solution was further constrained by Ni, Co, and Mo parameterizations from the literature. The pressure and temperature conditions of this solution represents a combination of the averaged effects of a deepening magma ocean through time and the "Moon-forming" impact...|$|R

To elucidate the molecular status of superinfection with these two hepatitis viruses, we cotransfected the full-length or truncated version of HCV structural genes (core and envelope 1) together with the cloned HBV DNA into a human hepatoma cell line (HuH- 7). Expression of HBV-specific major transcripts (3. 5 and 2. 1 kb), as well as HBV antigens (hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e and core antigens), was reduced about two- to fourfold {{by the presence of}} the HCV structural genes. In addition, the secretion of HBV viral particles, including the viral nucleocapsid and mature virion, was drastically suppressed about 20 -fold. Analysis of the intracellular HBV core protein-associated nucleic acid indicated that the encapsidated HBV pregenomic RNA was similarly reduced about 14 -fold. Deletion analysis of the HCV structural genes demonstrated that the core gene alone or the fragment containing the core protein's N-terminal 122 amino acid residues conferred the same level of suppressive activity as the full-length structural genes. By indirect immunofluorescence, we found that the core protein of HCV was located in the cytoplasm of transfected HuH- 7 cells at day 3 posttransfection and was targeted to the nucleus at day 6. Thus, the kinetics of the suppressive effect exerted by HCV constructs matched the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> protein entrance into the nucleus. Our results substantiate the clinical finding that HBV markers are suppressed by superinfection with HCV and further imply that this inhibitory effect may occur in the processes of transcription and encapsidation of HBV pregenomic RNA and may be mediated by the core protein of HCV. The deduced amino acid sequence of the HCV core protein has revealed that it is a basic protein which contains a putative DNA-binding motif (SPRG), as well as triplicate nuclear localization signals and several putative protein kinase A and C recognition sites. These characteristics imply that the HCV core protein can also function as a gene-regulatory protein...|$|R

A key parameter for the interpretation of 182 Hf/ 182 W data is the Hf/W ratio of the primitive (i. e. undepleted) mantle. Since W is incompatible during mantle melting, its ratio relative to U and other similarly incompatible elements in basalts (e. g. Th, La) may be used as proxies for their mantle sources. However, the assumption that W and U are equally incompatible may be flawed for petrological systems that equilibrated over a large range of oxygen fugacity (fO 2). Although W is typically perceived as being homovalent, evidence suggests that U is heterovalent over the range of fO 2 inferred for the silicate mantles of the Earth and the Moon. Here we report new partitioning data for W, U, high-field-strength elements (HFSE), and Th between clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and silicate melt. In agreement with previous studies, we show that these elements behave as homovalent elements at fO 2 characteristic of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s upper mantle. However, both W and U become more compatible at low fO 2, indicating a change in their redox state, with W becoming more compatible at progressively lower fO 2. This result for W is particularly unexpected, because this element was thought to be hexavalent even at very low fO 2. The much higher compatibility of W 4 + (the species inferred here at low fO 2) relative to W 6 + means that even a small fraction of W 4 + will have a significant effect on the overall compatibility of W. Our results imply that over the range of reducing conditions in which lunar differentiation is thought to have taken place (i. e. IW- 2 to IW- 0. 5), W is likely to become fractionated from U. When our partitioning data are applied to model the fractional crystallization of a lunar magma ocean, lunar trends for U/W, Hf/W and Th/W are well reproduced. The result of this model carries with it the implication that the Hf/W of the bulk silicate fractions that comprise the Earth and the Moon are virtually identical...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Understanding {{cellular}} {{responses to}} environmental stimuli requires {{not only the}} knowledge of specific regulatory components but also the quantitative characterization of the magnitude and timing of regulatory events. The two-component system {{is one of the}} major prokaryotic signaling schemes and is the focus of extensive interest in quantitative modeling and in-vestigation of signaling dynamics. Here we report how the binding affinity of the PhoB two-component response regulator (RR) to target promoters impacts the level and timing of expression of PhoB-regulated genes. Information content has often been used to assess the degree of conservation for transcription factor (TF) -binding sites. We show that increasing the information content of PhoB-binding sites in designed phoA promoters increased the binding affinity and that the binding affinity and con-centration of phosphorylated PhoB (PhoB~P) together dictate the level and timing of expression of phoA promoter variants. For various PhoB-regulated promoters with distinct promoter architectures, expression levels appear not to be correlated with TF-binding affinities, in contrast to the intuitive and oversimplified assumption that promoters with higher affinity for a TF tend to have higher expression levels. However, the expression <b>timing</b> of the <b>core</b> set of PhoB-regulated genes correlates well with the binding affinity of PhoB~P to individual promoters and the temporal hierarchy of gene expression appears to be re-lated to the function of gene products during the phosphate starvation response. Modulation of the information content and binding affinity of TF-binding sites may be a common strategy for temporal programming of the expression profile of RR-regulated genes...|$|R
40|$|Terms such as isochrony, {{syllable}} segregation, scanning {{speech and}} staccato-like rhythmic quality {{have been used}} to characterize the temporal regularity that may be a core feature of apraxia of speech. The present report describes a procedure to quantify temporal regularity in children with suspected apraxia of speech (sAOS). Conversational speech samples from 15 such children, together with samples from 30 3 – 6 -year-old children with normal speech acquisition and 30 3 – 6 -year-old children with moderate to severe speech delay of unknown origin, were selected from an audio archive. Signal processing routines were developed to identify and measure the duration of speech and pause events in 24 utterances from the speech samples of each of the 75 speakers. A value termed the coefficient of variation expressed the normalized variability in the durations of each participant’s speech events and pause events within each utterance. A metric termed the coefficient of variation ratio, derived by dividing the coefficient of variation for pause events by the coefficient of variation for speech events, expressed a speaker’s relative temporal variation in the two domains. The 15 children with sAOS had higher coefficient of variation ratios than the 30 children in each of the two comparison groups, indicating that the children with sAOS had proportionally more variation in the duration of pause events and/or less variation in the duration of speech events. Findings are interpreted as supporting the view that a constraint in speech <b>timing</b> is a <b>core</b> feature of the praxis disorder that defines a developmental form of apraxia of speech...|$|R
40|$|Several ranges {{encompassing}} {{more than}} 35, 000 km^ 2 of Sonora, Mexico, contain distinctly lineated and foliated granitic and metamorphic rocks {{that constitute the}} lower plates of metamorphic core complexes. Penetrative deformation is characterized by gently dipping mylonitic foliation across which northeast trending stretching lineation is everywhere developed. Prominent northwest trending fractures, dikes, and normal faults are orthogonal to the lineation. Most kinematic indicators in lower plate mylonitic rocks record top-to-the-southwest sense of shear. Upper plate stratigraphic sequences include Mesozoic supracrustal rocks, Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and allochthonous Precambrian basement. Tilted blocks of upper plate strata generally overlie the mylonites along gently dipping detachment faults. Previously published U-Pb and K-Ar ages from lower plate granitic orthogneisses, upper plate volcanic sequences, and crosscutting dikes constrain the time of mylonitic deformation and detachment faulting in several of these areas to late Oligocene-early Miocene. Partitioning of extensional strain in Sonora was influenced by pre-Tertiary crustal structure. The belt of core complexes developed across two contrasting blocks of continental crust separated by the N 60 degrees W striking Mojave-Sonora megashear. Portions of the southern Papago block (northeast of the megashear) consisting of Jurassic magmatic are rocks and Upper Jurassic-Cretaceous siliciclastic and carbonate strata resting upon a concealed, tectonically fragmented Precambrian basement were especially susceptible to crustal attenuation. Some core complexes of the southern Papago block occur within zones trending northwest that may coincide with Late Jurassic lineaments. In the Caborca block (southwest of the megashear), core complex-related rocks and structures have not been identified where surface exposures of Middle Proterozoic basement and overlying Upper Proterozoic-Paleozoic platform strata are common. However, extensional mylonitic fabrics are locally developed along the margins of a Tertiary two-mica granite batholith. Core complexes {{on both sides of}} the megashear appear to be preferentially developed where Tertiary granites have intruded regions of crust with basement disrupted by pre-Tertiary structures. Sonoran core complexes preserve an extensional tectonic history comparable with that described from core complexes farther north in the United States and Canadian Cordillera. The timing of mid crustal extension in Sonora (25 - 18 Ma) is contemporaneous with the <b>timing</b> of <b>core</b> complex development in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Extension occurred later in these areas than in the Pacific Northwest-British Columbia region but earlier than in the Mojave Desert-Death Valley region. Middle Tertiary mylonitic fabrics of similar style and orientation have not been recognized farther south in Mexico. The southern terminus of the mid-Tertiary Cordilleran core complex belt appears to be in Sonora...|$|R
40|$|Auditory signals (A) are {{perceived}} as lasting longer than visual signals (V) of the same physical duration when they are compared together. Despite considerable debate about how this illusion arises psychologically, the neural underpinnings have not been studied. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate the neural bases of audiovisual temporal distortions and more generally, intersensory timing. Adults underwent fMRI while judging the relative duration of successively presented standard interval (SI) -comparison interval (CI) pairs, which were unimodal (A-A, V-V) or crossmodal (V-A, A-V). Mechanisms of time dilation and compression were identified by comparing the two crossmodal pairs. Mechanisms of intersensory timing were identified by comparing the unimodal and crossmodal conditions. The behavioral results showed that auditory CIs were perceived as lasting longer than visual CIs. There were three novel fMRI results. First, time dilation and compression were distinguished by differential activation of higher sensory areas (superior temporal, posterior insula, middle occipital), which typically showed stronger effective connectivity when time was dilated (V-A). Second, when time was compressed (A-V) activation was greater in frontal cognitive-control centers, which guide decision making. These areas did not exhibit effective connectivity. Third, intrasensory timing was distinguished from intersensory timing partly by decreased striatal and increased superior parietal activation. These regions showed stronger connectivity with visual, memory, and cognitive-control centers during intersensory timing. Altogether, the results indicate that time dilation and compression arise from the connectivity strength of higher sensory systems with other areas. Conversely, more extensive network interactions are needed with <b>core</b> <b>timing</b> (striatum) and attention (superior parietal) centers to integrate time codes for intersensory signals...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of coupled enrichments in 186 Os/ 188 Os and 187 Os/ 188 Os in some mantle-derived materials reflects long-term elevation of Pt/Os and Re/Os {{relative to the}} primitive upper mantle. New Os data for the 89 Ma Gorgona Island, Colombia komatiites indicate that these lavas are also variably enriched in 186 Os and 187 Os, with 186 Os/ 188 Os ranging between 0. 1198397 ± 22 and 0. 1198470 ± 38, and with ?Os correspondingly ranging from + 0. 15 to + 4. 4. These data define a linear trend that converges with the previously reported linear trend generated from data for modern Hawaiian picritic lavas and a sample from the ca. 251 Ma Siberian plume, to a common component with a 186 Os/ 188 Os of approximately 0. 119870 and ?Os of + 17. 5. The convergence of these data to this Os isotopic composition may imply a single ubiquitous source in the Earth's interior that mixes {{with a variety of}} different mantle compositions distinguished by variations in ? Os. The 187 Os- and 186 Os-enriched component may have been generated via early crystallization of the solid inner core and consequent increases in Pt/Os and Re/Os in the liquid outer core, with time leading to suprachondritic 186 Os/ 188 Os and ?Os in the outer core. The {{presence of}} Os from the outer core in certain portions of the mantle would require a mechanism that could transfer Os from the outer core to the lower mantle, and thence to the surface. If this is the process that generated the isotopic enrichments in the mantle sources of these plume-derived systems, then the current understanding of solid metal–liquid metal partitioning of Pt, Re and Os requires that crystallization of the inner core began prior to 3. 5 Ga. Thus, the Os isotopic data reported here provide a new source of data to better constrain the <b>timing</b> of inner <b>core</b> formation, complementing magnetic field paleo-intensity measurements as data sources that constrain models based on secular cooling of the Earth...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A midloop operation test was performed in 1992 at the BETHSY Integral Test Facility in Grenoble, France. The purpose of this experiment was to produce data {{that could be used to}} assess the performance of thermal hydraulic codes under the conditions of low pressure and decay heat. The specific scenario of the test involved the loss of the residual heat removal system in a midloop operation with manways vents open in the pressurizer and at the steam generator. In participation with the International Standard Problem # 38, the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code was used to simulate the transient conducted experimentally at the BETHSY facility and assess its ability to accurately predict the observed phenomena. The overall conclusion is that the code performed quite well in terms of predicting macroscopic trends and their timing, but did not describe more specific thermal hydraulic phenomena accurately. Specific areas of disagreement included predicting water holdup cycles in the pressurizer, two-phase mixture levels in the guide tube, upper core void and temperature profiles, entrainment phenomena in the upper head bypass and mass flow ratios between the upper head bypass, pressurizer manway, and steam generator manway. The code predicted well the <b>timing</b> of the <b>core</b> uncovery and maximum core heater cladding temperature, and the integrated phasic mass flow rates at the steam generator manway. Some of these good predictions was the result of compensating errors in the prediction of component thermal hydraulic phenomena. The consequence of the poor code performance in predicting the pressurizer/pressurizer surge line phenomena was a substantial delay in the falloff of the initial system pressurization, an underestimation of the pressurizer integrated mass flow rate, and the emptying of the hot leg and upper plenum. Large mass errors were generated by the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. 1. 1 release of this code. Typical errors were around 20 % of the total system mass by the end of the transient...|$|R
40|$|Remanufacturing is an {{important}} product recovery option that benefits our sustainable development. Cores, i. e. the used products/parts, are essential resources for remanufacturing. Without cores, {{there will not be}} any remanufactured products. Challenges in the core acquisition process are mainly caused by the uncertainties of: return volume, <b>timing</b> and <b>core</b> quality. Core Acquisition Management actively attempts to reduce these uncertainties and achieve a better balance of demand and return for the remanufacturers. The aim of this dissertation is to extend the knowledge of Core Acquisition Management in remanufacturing, by investigating the current status of research and industrial practice, and developing quantitative models that assist the decision making in the core acquisition process. In the dissertation, a literature review is firstly conducted to provide an overview about the current research in Core Acquisition Management. Possible further research interests, for example, more studies based on non-hybrid remanufacturing systems and imperfect substitution assumption are suggested. Through an industrial survey carried out in a fast developing remanufacturing market - China, environmental responsibility and ethical  concerns, customer orientation and strategic advantage are identified as the most important motives for the remanufacturers, while customer recognition is their most serious barrier at present. Suggestions for further improving the Chinese remanufacturing industry from the policy-makers’ perspective are provided. After the above investigation, mathematical models are then developed to assist the acquisition decisions in two aspects: to deal with the uncertainties of return volume and timing, and to deal with the uncertainties of core quality. Acquisition decision about volume and timing is firstly studied from a product life cycle perspective, where the demands for remanufactured products and the core availability change over time. According to industrial observations, the remanufacturing cost decreases with respect to its core inventory. Using optimal control theory, core acquisition and remanufacturing decisions are derived to maximize the remanufacturer's profit. It is found that besides a simple bang-bang type control policy (either collecting as much as possible, or nothing), a special form of synchronizing policy (adjusting the core collection rate with demand rate) also exists. Furthermore, the acquisition decision depends greatly on the valuation of cores, and Real Option Valuation approaches are later used to capture the value of flexibility provided by owning cores when different aspects of remanufacturing environment are random. More specifically, the value of disposing a core earlier is investigated when the price of remanufactured product is uncertain, and the impact of the correlation between stochastic demand and return is also studied. To deal with the uncertainties of core quality, refund policies with different numbers of quality classes are studied. Under the assumption of uniformly distributed quality, analytical solutions for these refund policies are derived. Numerical examples indicate that the customers’ valuation of cores is {{an important}} factor influencing the return rates and the remanufacturer’s profit. Refund policies with a small number of quality classes could already bring major advantages. Credit refund policies (without deposits) are included for comparisons. In addition, within a game theory framework, the trade-off of two types of errors of the quality inspection in a deposit-refund policy is studied. The salvage values of different cores show great influences on the remanufacturer’s policy choices. The value of information transparency about the inspection errors are studied under different conditions. Interestingly, the customer may actually return more low quality cores when the inspection accuracy is improved...|$|R
