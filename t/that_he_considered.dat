In a 2006 interview, McAvoy said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> becoming a priest {{as a child}} because {{it seemed to be}} a way to explore the world via missionary work. During his education, he worked at a local bakery.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an earlier version of the script to the point <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E

5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant and Ralph Brown (from Withnail and I) with Grant playing Clemens, but Grant declined the role. Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> the film superior to Aliens and its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox. According to the actor, his role as Clemens exposed him to American audiences {{and led to a}} prominent role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for his}} son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered,</b> but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> {{it impossible}} for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> {{the woman who}} had lost her dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{sources have}} not {{recorded}} {{the aftermath of}} the battle but, according to the accounts of the contemporary Arab historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, the Bulgarians marched towards Constantinople. Leo VI was in such a panic <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> arming Arab prisoners of war and sending them against the Bulgarians in return for their freedom, but eventually abandoned the idea. Further negotiations followed until the Byzantines agreed to the Bulgarian demands.|$|E

5|$|The type {{remains of}} Hypacrosaurus remains were {{collected}} in 1910 by Barnum Brown for the American Museum of Natural History. The remains, a partial postcranial skeleton consisting of several vertebrae and a partial pelvis (AMNH 5204), came from along the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry, Alberta, Canada, from rocks {{of what is now}} known as the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous). Brown described these remains, in combination with other postcranial bones, in 1913 as a new genus <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be like Saurolophus. No skull was known at this time, but two skulls were soon discovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Together, Lorne Michaels, Belushi's brother Jim Belushi, and Judith Jacklin Belushi, {{reviewed}} the actor's comedic sketches from Saturday Night Live to select what were generally considered his best works. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Daily News on the 1985 VHS release, Belushi's widow commented she was not sure if her husband had a particular sketch he liked the most, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> the Star Trek parody among his favorites. The Best of John Belushi edition in VHS format sold approximately 200,000 copies. It reached number three on Billboard's Top Videocassettes Sales Chart in February 1986.|$|E
5|$|Von Stroheim {{did not see}} Greed as {{political}} and told a journalist <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it {{to be like a}} Greek tragedy. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.|$|E

5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E

5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it more likely to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it {{his duty}} as {{president}} {{to attend the}} game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E

Wolf continued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> Nazi-era youth Tommy Scheel, who smuggled swing records and British fashion as a form of rebellion against the Nazis, as the [...] "hippest of them all" [...] and [...] "almost like a proto-punk".|$|R
