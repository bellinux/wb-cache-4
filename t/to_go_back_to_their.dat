Rodríguez, {{commander}} of the Ecuadorian forces defending the province of El Oro during the war, the incidents of 5 July started when an Ecuadorian border patrol found some Peruvian civilians, protected by policemen, clearing a patch of land on the Ecuadorian side of the river. Upon seeing the patrol, the Peruvian policemen opened fire, killing one soldier. This {{was followed by the}} widespread exchange of fire between troops on the opposing banks of the Zarumilla, while two Ecuadorian officers sent to Aguas Verdes to speak with the Peruvian local commanding officer were told by Peruvian authorities <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> lines.|$|E

25|$|Kuber and {{his people}} moved {{as far as the}} region of Thessaloniki. He decided to settle {{together}} with the Sermesianoi in a plain and sent his envoy to the Byzantine Emperor, whom the Miracles of Saint Demetrios did not name, to request his permission. The emperor gave his consent and ordered the nearby Slavic tribe of the Dragovites to supply Kuber {{and his people}} with food. However, Kuber's people still wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ancestral homes and started to disperse. Fearing of the decline of his power base, Kuber asked the emperor to forbid the Sermesianoi to leave the plain and to confirm Kuber's position as their ruler. His request seems to have been rejected, because he attempted to seize Thessaloniki, taking advantage of a civil war in the city. However, Saint Demetrius unmasked Kuber's agents who tried to open the gates of Thessaloniki, hindering him from entering the city, according to the saint's hagiography.|$|E
500|$|According to drummer Sean Moore, {{the band}} {{felt they had}} been [...] "going a bit astray" [...] with their {{previous}} album, 1993's Gold Against the Soul, and so the approach to the follow-up was for the band <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> [...] "grass roots" [...] and rediscover [...] "a little bit of Britishness that we lacked". Singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalls the band feeling they had become [...] "a bit too rockist [...] we had lost our direction". The band stopped listening to American rock music and returned to influences that had inspired them when they first formed, including Magazine, Wire, Skids, PiL, Gang of Four and Joy Division.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the band wanted a [...] "performance video" [...] and that they wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> [...] "rock roots". When asked the concept behind the video, Webb said: [...] "They provided the sound and I provided the lights. A whole lot of lights. We used {{the same guy who}} did the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — we used a bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks. There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E

500|$|The canons were seldom {{used for}} the {{intended}} purpose. However, {{they were used to}} provide gun salute every year {{on the occasion of the}} birthday of Kamehameha III. Another notable daily event at the fort was the beating of the drums at dusk by guards as a signal (a curfew) to the sailors on land <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ships. This practice is recorded in detail by Jones as: [...] "Seamen are obliged to be clear of the beach at drumbeat—eight o'clock in the evening. [...] No person is allowed to remain on shore over night, unless furnished with a proper pass by the captain of the port; and any one found on the beach, or in the town, with no pass, after the proper time, is marched to the calboose, where he is kept in confinement till morning, and then muleted in a pretty round sum for breaking the laws. [...] This is generally paid by the captain, and afterward, with pretty good interest, deducted from Jack's pay." ...|$|E
500|$|After the bad {{commercial}} results of Running Wild, Mercury broke {{the contract with}} Girlschool, leaving the band without financial backup and with a career in dire straits. [...] "Back to square one again", McAuliffe said at the time. The band decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> roots, remaining a quartet with only McAuliffe on vocals and going on a UK tour in November – December 1985 supporting Blue Öyster Cult; their immediate goal was to play {{as much as they}} could and regain some of their fan base. In early 1986, thanks again to Lemmy’s suggestion, they eventually signed for Doug Smith’s new label GWR Records, which also included in their roster Motörhead. The girls immediately started working on a new album with their old producer Vic Maile at Jackson’s Studio in Rickmansworth. The first output of their new work was a team-up with British glam rock singer Gary Glitter for the cover of his 1973 hit [...] "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)", which was released as a single in April 1986. The album Nightmare at Maple Cross, released in July of the same year, marked for the band the return to the sound of Hit and Run and to their trademark abrasive lyrics. The album received fairly good reviews, but it did not enter the British charts and was released in North America only a year later. The following European tour saw the girls supporting the Scottish hard rock band Nazareth.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{band members}} {{moving on to}} new or {{previous}} projects, they also alluded {{to the possibility of}} reforming in the future. Patrick {{said in an interview that}} he wouldn't mind possibly reuniting Army of Anyone someday, but only if the conditions weren't too difficult. Dean DeLeo answered similarly when asked the same question, stating [...] "I don’t know man, I would love to." [...] In an interview after Korn's May 24, 2010 show in Omaha, Nebraska, Luzier went as far as to say that there were plans for all members to reconvene to work on a second album after Korn, Filter and Stone Temple Pilots' respective Summer 2010 tours. However, no other band members would report on such concrete plans, with Patrick even stating in a July 2010 that Filter was his main focus for the foreseeable future. He would also expand on this later on, complaining that the first one took too long (three years), and he and Robert DeLeo agreed it may be best <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> previous bands for now.|$|E
2500|$|Sales of {{relaxers}} took a great fall among African-American {{women from}} 2010 to 2015. Many African-American women gave up relaxers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> natural roots. Celebrities like Esperanza Spalding, Janelle Monáe and Solange Knowles have played with natural hair looks. During {{the same time}} period, the number of natural-hair support groups has increased.

This is entirely new," [...] according to Terry Shrosphire in the article [...] "Black Hair Relaxer Sales are Slumping Because Of This". Research has shown that relaxer sales dropped from $206 million in 2008 to $156 million in 2013. Meanwhile, sales of products for styling natural hair continued to rise. Chris Rock's documentary Good Hair has shown what many women go through to achieve the [...] "European standard" [...] of hair. [...] "Weaves that cost thousands of dollars and relaxers that take way too much time. Black woman has finally decided that it was simply too much," [...] according to the documentary.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, the BMA {{administrator}} {{called for}} a meeting that included the Mufti and Abuna Marcos {{and asked them to}} calm the people and ask for reconciliation and both agreed. The next day a convoy of four cars: (In the first car were armed Police, in the 2nd was the Asmara Administrator with his Arabic translator, in the third were the Mufti and the Abuna and in the 4th was the Asmara & Hamassein Judge and the vice of the Abuna) moved to the districts of ‘Geza Berhanu’, Edaga Arbi, Akhria, Edaga Hamus, Aba Shawl, Hadish [...] Adi and Gaza Banda. In each location people were addressed with microphones to gather in both Arabic and Tigrinya and were told that the Police will not harm them. In places where there were a majority of Christians the Abuna will address them first and later the Mufti calling the people to end the violence and vice versa in the other locations where the majority were Muslims. Later the people were told <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> homes. In the evening the Mufti and the Abuna went to the Radio Station and advised the citizens to end violence. The wise men from both sides accepted the call, but the looting of properties of Muslim merchants continued for 3 more days before the riots came to an end.|$|E

2500|$|Halloween in the Castro {{was tied}} to the LGBT culture of San Francisco and [...] began in the 1950-1960s in the Tenderloin/Polk street area of the city where the {{mainstream}} gay bars were first centralized. The event traces its history to the ostracism of LGBT people {{in the first half}} of the 20th century from mainstream culture which led to community identity and using gay bars as a focal point for socializing, networking and organizing politically. After World War II, in the 1940s, the San Francisco Bay Area became a haven for LGBT military personnel who didn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> old lives. In the 1950s, a group of gay bars in San Francisco's Tenderloin area helped create a strip of venues for [...] "sex, drugs and late night fun". There has also been a South-of-Market (SoMa) leather subculture and BDSM bar scene with gay-focussed sex clubs sharing Folsom street, a tradition which is carried on with the annual Folsom Street Fair. The nearby business- and tourist-oriented area, Union Square, was also popular for cruising for sex and was open to gay men whereas the Tenderloin was where drag queens, t-girls and prostitutes of all orientations were known to congregate publicly in the city, because they were unwelcome in gay bars at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1890 season, {{nearly all}} of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh Burghers. [...] The Players' League {{collapsed}} after the season, and the players were allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> old clubs. [...] However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the AA's Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. [...] In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was [...] "piratical". This incident (which is discussed at some length in The Beer and Whisky League, by David Nemec, 1994) quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, they made sport of being denounced for being [...] "piratical" [...] by renaming themselves [...] "the Pirates" [...] for the 1891 season. The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. Around the time the team adopted the Pirates nickname, the United States Board on Geographic Names forced the city of Pittsburgh to undergo a controversial name change by having them drop the [...] "h" [...] {{at the end of the}} name, making the team's official name the [...] "Pittsburg Pirates" [...] from the adoption of the Pirates nickname until Pittsburgh was able to get the [...] "h" [...] restored to its name in 1911.|$|E
