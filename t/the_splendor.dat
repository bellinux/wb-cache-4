5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

25|$|Haninai's posthumous son Bostanai was {{the first}} of the exilarchs under Arabic rule. Bostanai was the {{ancestor}} of the exilarchs who were in office from the time when the Persian empire was conquered by the Arabs, in 642, down to the 11th century. Through him, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of the office was renewed and its political position made secure. His tomb in Pumbedita was a place of worship as late as the 12th century, according to Benjamin of Tudela.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} {{of medical and}} biological sciences in the nineteenth century, {{the impact of the}} work of Claude Bernard (1813–1878), Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) Robert Koch (1843–1910), Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) and all <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of French medical schools, Vienna, Berlin and Edinburgh, was a stimulus {{for the creation of a}} medical school in the country. The basic medical school program lasts seven years. There is also a second medical school in the country, it is private and located in Punta del Este, Maldonado.|$|E
25|$|Zemfira asks Aleko if {{he misses}} <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of his homeland, but he {{responds}} that his only desire is {{to spend his}} life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174–176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells {{a story of a}} man that he knew who spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E

Only married men could give such Feasts, {{and his wife}} took a prominent and honoured place during the ritual which emphasised male-female co-operation and interdependence. His wife brewed the beer which he offered to the guests. The event displayed ceremonies and festivities organised by the sponsor. The Feast given by a wealthier tribes person would be more extravagant. He would typically invite everyone from the tribe. This event bestowed honour to the couple from the tribe. After the Feast, the tribe would give the couple rights to ornaments equally.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, {{most of the}} cathedral's {{valuables}} were looted, and the thievery {{continued for}} several more years until the cathedral was finally closed in 1938. There were rumors of plans to demolish the cathedral and use the remaining material for a district workers' theatre. However, the cathedral {{was transferred to the}} Soviet Ministry of Telecommunications, for which it became a warehouse. Only in 1990 did the cathedral return to the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church, when restoration began. By that time, the interior was largely bare, compared to <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> and majesty of its pre-Revolutionary past.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} Vatican, Bernini created {{systematic}} rearrangements and majestic embellishment of either empty or aesthetically undistinguished space that exist as he designed {{them to the}} present day and have become indelible icons of <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of the papal precincts. Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the Cathedra Petri, the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the Baldacchino created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the Scala Regia, the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever tricks of optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.|$|E

25|$|Ögedei {{dispatched}} {{him along}} with his relatives to attack the Kipchaks, Russians, and Bulgars in the west in 1235. When the most formidable Kipchak chief, Bachman, fled to {{an island in the}} Volga delta. Möngke crossed the river and captured him. When he ordered Bachman to bend down on his knees, Bachman refused and was executed by Möngke's brother Bujek. Möngke also engaged in hand-to-hand combat during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. While his cousins, Shiban and Büri, went to Crimea, Möngke and Kadan, a son of Ögedei, were ordered to reduce the tribes in the Caucasus. The Mongols captured the Alan capital Maghas and massacred its inhabitants. Many chiefs of the Alans and Circassians surrendered to Möngke. After the conquest of Europe, Möngke would bring them back to Mongolia. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev (1240). Möngke was apparently taken by <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of Kiev and offered the city surrender, but his envoys were killed. After Batu's army joined Möngke's soldiers, they sacked the city. He also fought alongside Batu at the Battle of Mohi. In the summer of 1241, before the premature end of the campaign, Möngke returned home after his uncle Ögedei recalled him in the winter of 1240–41. However, Ögedei died.|$|E
500|$|Gábor Klaniczay {{emphasizes}} that Ladislaus [...] "seemed expressly designed to personify the knight-king ideal" [...] of his age. During {{the reign of}} Ladislaus's successor, Coloman the Learned, Bishop Hartvik said that Ladislaus's [...] "character was distinguished by the respectability of morals and remarkable for <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of his virtues". The so-called Gesta Ladislai regis ("The Deeds of King Ladislaus"), which are the texts about Ladislaus's life and reign preserved in 14th-century Hungarian chronicles, were written during Coloman's rule. Five significant events of Ladislaus's life, which {{were not included in}} his official legend, were only preserved in the Gesta.|$|E
500|$|The {{site of the}} Royal Stoa is {{currently}} occupied by [...] the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine, and is therefore unavailable for archaeological exploration. Between 1968 and 1978, however, professor Benjamin Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem carried out excavations {{at the foot of}} the southern wall. These uncovered over 400 architectural fragments in the destruction debris below the site of the Stoa, some of which were incorporated in secondary use in later Byzantine and Ummayad construction. Despite their fragmentary nature, these provide some of the largest and richest Second-Temple era assemblages ever found, a testament to <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> described by Josephus.|$|E

500|$|Light {{became a}} popular means for 15th-century Northern {{painters}} {{to represent the}} mystery of the Incarnation, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and [...] "virgo intacta". This is reflected in a passage attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux from his [...] "Sermones de Diversis"; [...] "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting it when entering nor destroying it when emerging: thus the word of God, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E
500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century. Millard Meiss notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass {{to the passage of}} the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin. St. Bernard likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: [...] "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E
500|$|Warhol had a {{positive}} view of ordinary culture and felt the abstract expressionists had taken great pains to ignore <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of modernity. The Campbell's Soup Can series, along with his other series, provided him {{with a chance to}} express his positive view of modern culture. However, his deadpan manner endeavored to be devoid of emotional and social commentary. The work was intended to be without personality or individual expression. Warhol's view is encapsulated in the Time magazine description of the 'Slice of Cake School,' that [...] "... a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can, when transposed to canvas, become Art." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Corliss of Time named WALL-E his {{favorite}} film of 2008 (and later of the decade), noting the film succeeded in [...] "connect {{with a huge}} audience" [...] despite the main characters' lack of speech and [...] "emotional signifiers like a mouth, eyebrows, shoulders, [...] elbows". It [...] "evoke <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of the movie past" [...] and he also compared WALL-E and EVE's relationship to the chemistry of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Other critics who named WALL-E their favorite film of 2008 included Tom Charity of CNN, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times, Christopher Orr of The New Republic, Ty Burr and Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, and Anthony Lane of The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|Kalākaua {{met with}} {{heads of state}} in Asia, the Mideast and Europe, to {{encourage}} an influx of sugar plantation labor in family groups, as well as unmarried women as potential brides for Hawaii's existing contract laborers. While in Asia, he tried to forestall American ambitions by offering a plan to Emperor Meiji for putting Hawaii {{under the protection of}} the Empire of Japan with an arranged marriage between his niece Kaʻiulani and a Japanese prince. On his visit to Portugal, he negotiated a treaty of friendship and commerce with Hawaii that would provide a legal framework for the emigration of Portuguese [...] laborers to Hawaii. The King had an audience in Rome with Pope Leo XIII and met with many of the crowned heads of Europe. Britain's Queen Victoria and <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> of her royal life impressed him more than any other monarchy; having been greatly affected by the ornate trappings of European sovereigns, he would soon have Hawaii's monarchy mirror that grandeur.|$|E
500|$|Kohn {{regarded}} its visuals as {{the pinnacle}} of the show. Sava wrote {{that the notion of}} time being a flat circle could have inspired the circular shape of the inner frame. He noted the use of color beyond the circle as a way to convey the many emotions evoked for the whole of the episode. Ignoring this device, Sava saw its use as humorous diversions while it contributed to <b>the</b> <b>splendor.</b> Nussbaum described the creatures appearing in the outer frame as annotative and a mute chorus, suggesting they live in a parallel universe of both connection and isolation. The episode was later released on DVD twice, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Princess Day box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. Home video critic Justin Remer called [...] "Bad Timing" [...] "surprisingly devastating" [...] in DVD Talk. Kohn summed up the episode's climax as the [...] of Adventure Time.|$|E
