40|$|This report {{describes}} the slope A/D measurement of a resistance and {{the ease with}} which it can be applied to MSP 430 microcontrollers. It describes a digital thermometer design that uses the slope ADC capabilities of the <b>Timer</b> Port <b>module</b> on the MSP 430 x 3 xx microcontrollers. It is used more generally as a reference on how to connect resistive sensors and reference resistors to the <b>Timer</b> Port <b>module.</b> All MSP 430 x 3 xx devices include the <b>Timer</b> Port <b>module.</b> The module allows several resistive sensors and reference resistors to be connected in an application. Unused module pins can be used as independent outputs. Slope A/D conversion is an analog-to-digital conversion technique that can be implemented with a comparator rather than a standalone ADC module or device. The technique is based on the charging/discharging of a capacitor with a known value. The number of clock cycles necessary to discharge the capacitor is then counted. Longer discharge times indicate larger voltages. The voltage is derived from the discharge time using the standard equation for capacitor discharge. In addition to digitizing voltages, a variation of the technique can be used to measure resistance. This is valuable in measuring any component that can have varying resistance, such as potentiometers and various types of transducers. Unlike voltage measurement, where the key relationship is between voltage and time while the resistance is constant, the key relationship in resistance measurement is between resistance and time, while the initial voltage remains constant. The R-relationship is linear, which means the calculation is easier and less- costly to implement in a microcontroller than for the exponential V-t relationship. The thermometer has been simulated by using a variable resistance instead of a thyristor. In addition care has been taken to optimize the power consumption by forcing the microcontroller to several low-power modes during the operation. The combination of the <b>Timer</b> Port <b>module,</b> the 16 -bit CPU, and the ultra low power design provide unmatched MIPS per watt performance.

In the second, a hierarchy of timing wheels with different granularities is used to span a greater range of intervals.

This {{order is}} ensured in budding yeast by the mitotic exit network (MEN), where Cdc 14 p dephosphorylates key conserved Cdk 1 -substrates {{exemplified by the}} anaphase spindle-elongation protein Ase 1 p. However, in metazoans, MEN and Cdc 14 function is not conserved. Instead, the PP 2 A-B 55 α/ENSA/Greatwall (BEG) pathway controls the human Ase 1 p ortholog PRC 1. In this pathway, PP 2 A-B 55 inhibition is coupled to Cdk 1 -cyclin B activity, whereas separase inhibition is maintained by cyclin B concentration. This creates two cyclin B thresholds during mitotic exit. Simulation and experiments using PRC 1 as a model substrate show that the first threshold permits separase activation and chromosome segregation, and the second permits PP 2 A-B 55 activation and initiation of cytokinesis. Removal of the ENSA/Greatwall (EG) <b>timer</b> <b>module</b> eliminates this second threshold, as well as associated delay in PRC 1 dephosphorylation and initiation of cytokinesis, by uncoupling PP 2 A-B 55 from Cdk 1 -cyclin B activity.

An MC 6840 programmable <b>timer</b> <b>module</b> (PTM) was used to give real-time PWM voltage waveforms at its three outputs. The MC 68000 calculates {{the width of the}} pulses for only the first quarter cycle and sorts these into a table.

A real-time method of setting the 120 ° phase shift between the three phases of the pulses using the PTM was developed and showed a good level of accuracy.

The DC motor used on the UI Project System pictured in Appendix III has a Hall Effect sensor that provides a pulse each time the DC motor shaft makes a revolution. 1 There are two methods of measuring the frequency of the tachometer. The pulses can be counted per unit time or the inverse computed of the period between two successive transitions. Measuring frequency by counting pulses over short intervals is more accurate for signals when the frequency of the signal being measured relatively high.

40|$|Point {{to point}} {{communication}} between sensor and the Embedded Control Unit (ECU) {{is a very}} important and basic task in automotive domain. But, there are no efficient protocols to implement the same. Earlier protocols used to fulfill the communication between Transmitter (sensor) and receiver (ECU) is Analog output protocol and Pulse width modulation protocol. But, there are many difficulties w. r. t cost, speed, diagnosis etc [...] . So, the alternate solution to replace the two earlier protocols and improve the performance w. r. t Speed of operation and Cost is the Single Edge Nibble Transmission (SENT) Protocol. SENT is a unidirectional communication scheme from sensor/transmitting device to receiving/ECU. The sensor signal is transmitted as a series of pulses with data encoded as falling to falling edge periods. Details of the signal encoding may vary for specific sensor. SENT frame sent from the sensor will be received by the TIM (Timer Input Module), sub module of GTM (Generic <b>Timer</b> <b>Module).</b> Another sub module of GTM namely MCS (multi-channel sequencer) is used to process the frame. MCS is configured such that it allows +/- 20 % clock deviation for the data frames; detects CRC errors; generates interrupts on CRC error, data error, calibration error etc. SENT (Single Edge Nibble Transmission) defines a level of standardization in the implementation of the digital pulse scheme for reporting sensor information.

40|$|Integrated {{electronic}} systems {{are more and}} more used in a wide number of applications and environments, ranging from mobile devices to safety-critical products. This wide distribution is mainly due to the miniaturization surrounded by an increasing computing power of semiconductor devices. However, there are many complex and arduous challenges associated to this phenomenon. One of these challenges is the reliability of {{electronic systems}}. Nowadays, several research e↵orts are aimed at improving the semiconductors reliability. Manufacturing processes, aging phenomena of components and environmental stress may cause internal permanent defects and damages during the lifetime of a device; in the other side, the environment in which these devices are employed could introduce soft errors (i. e., errors that do not damage the device but a data during the computation) in their internal circuitry, thus compromising the correct behavior of the whole system. Consequently, in order to guarantee product quality and consumer satisfaction, it is necessary to discover faults as soon as possible (both, in the manufacturing process and during the devices lifetime); moreover, it is equally important to provide the electronic systems with fault tolerance equipments aimed to assure a correct functioning in every condition. Despite the reliability requirements, modern electronic systems require also an increasing computational power to satisfy the customers needs. In order to face to this demand, {{in the last two decades}} di↵erent powerful computational devices have been designed and developed. They are mainly based on architectures allowing the execution of multiple computations in parallel at the same time. Among the others, the Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors are a particular type of multicore and reconfigurable processors; they have been developed to perform several operations in parallel, where the scheduling of the operations themselves is completely demanded at the compiler: VLIWs are suitable for systems requiring high computational performance maintaining a reduced power consumption. Another interesting type of multicore computational units are the General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) : their very high computational power, combined with low cost, reduced power consumption, and flexible development platforms are pushing their adoption not only for graphical applications, but also in the High Performance Computing (HPC) market and in embedded devices. Moreover, GPGPUs are increasingly used in some safety-critical embedded domains, such as automotive, avionics, space and biomedical. The main in common feature of VLIWs and GPGPUs is that they can be used in a System-on-Chip (SoC) as computational co-processors: in a typical SoC, in fact, the main Central Processing Unit (CPU) is in charge of demand and supervise the execution of data intensive operations to these architectures; in this way, the workload of the CPU itself is lower. As an example, in the NASA labs, VLIWs have been evaluated to efficiently perform image analysis on board a Mars rover for future space missions, while the main CPU of the system is available to perform other realtime control operations. In the other hand, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) which are increasingly common in cars, uses GPGPUs or GPGPU-like devices to analyze images (or radar signals) coming from external cameras and sensors to detect possible obstacles, requiring the automatic intervention of the breaking system. In this PhD thesis, several new techniques have been developed with the common goal of improving the reliability characteristics of multicore processing units. More in particular, considering VLIW processors, new test and diagnostic methods have been studied and implemented in order to detect permanent faults; they are mainly based on the Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) technique. The final goal is to reduce the time required to perform the test of a generic VLIW processor, and to efficiently localize the faulty module. On the other hand, the present dissertation focus on the e↵ects introduced by soft errors in GPGPU devices; this works have been done through the execution of several neutron radiation tests. At the end of these analysis, new techniques finalized to the fault tolerance enhancement of GPGPU applications have been proposed. As industrial case, the validation of a programmable timing multicore co-processor module (i. e., the Generic <b>Timer</b> <b>Module</b> manufactured by Bosch) used in the today automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs) has been designed and implemented. More in particular, an FPGA-based validation platform has been developed, where one of its main feature is the ability to efficiently verify the behavior of the module under test, thus ensuring a correct implementation of the software running on it.
