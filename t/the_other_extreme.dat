5|$|While sharks {{had been}} seen as harmless, the {{pendulum}} of public opinion quickly swung to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> and sharks quickly came to be viewed not only as eating machines, but also as fearless, ruthless killers.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> in {{the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> {{the striped}} {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E

50|$|Other {{portions}} of a stand could be heavily thinned or gaps or openings could be created. These areas accelerate the {{growth rates of}} trees in the open areas or on their perimeter and help retain or develop long crowns with live branches. Another portion of the stand, {{sometimes referred to as}} the matrix, is thinned to result in residual trees densities which area in between <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extremes.</b> Over <b>the</b> whole area, a wide variety of trees with different diameters and species are retained.|$|R
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades {{has been reduced to}} a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted {{on the sides of the}} head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> Plinian eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme,</b> the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

40|$|Fish is an {{important}} part of the diet of human in almost all the countries of the world. Animal proteins are generally superior to plant proteins and fish is one of the cheapest sources of quality animal protein and availability and affordability is better for fish in comparison to other animal protein sources. Fish serves as a health food for the affluent world owing to the fish oils which are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially the omega- 3 PUFAs and at the same time, it is a health food in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extremes</b> of <b>the</b> nutritional scale owing to its proteins, oils, vitamins and minerals and the benefits associated with the consumption of small indigenous fishes...|$|R

5|$|Canis Major is {{also home}} to many {{variable}} stars. EZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf–Rayet star of spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766 days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation. VY Canis Majoris {{is one of the largest}} stars known, a remote red supergiant located around 3800 light-years away from Earth. Estimates of its size, mass and luminosity have varied, with figures of 600 to 3000 times the radius, and 60,000 to 500,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. It was observed in 2011 using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope, yielding a radius of 1420 ± 120 solar radii, surface temperature of around 3490 K (and hence spectral type M4Ia) and a luminosity 270,000 times that of the Sun. Its current mass has been revised at 9–25 solar masses, having shed material from an initial 15–35 solar masses. W Canis Majoris is a type of red giant known as a carbon star—a semiregular variable, it ranges between magnitudes 6.27 and 7.09 over a period of 160 days. A cool star, it has a surface temperature of around 2900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun, its distance estimated at 1444–1450 light-years from Earth. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>extreme</b> in size is RX J0720.4-3125, a neutron star with a radius of around 5km. Exceedingly faint, it has an apparent magnitude of 26.6. Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously changing over several years. The nature of the changes are unclear, but it is possible they were caused by an event such as the star's absorption of an accretion disc.|$|E
