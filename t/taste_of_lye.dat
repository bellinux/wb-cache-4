The environment will be polluted, if the improper handing <b>of</b> waste <b>lye,</b> and discharged into the surface water. The washing process of the synthetic zeolite was studied in this paper. Rational recycling <b>of</b> waste <b>lye</b> and {{reduce the amount of}} it emissions in the washing process were found. By comparing the environmental effects and the technical and economic, the method of washing with water-acid-water was determined to be the best solution of the zeolite washed. The waste lye can be recovered in this method, and it will be used for preparation <b>of</b> <b>lye</b> in the next synthetic zeolite.
