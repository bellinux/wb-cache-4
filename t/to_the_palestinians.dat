5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue a call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E
25|$|At the Arab League {{summit of}} October 1947, in Aley, the Iraqi general, Ismail Safwat, painted a realist {{picture of the}} situation. He {{underlined}} the better organization and greater financial support of the Jewish people in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> He recommended the immediate deployment of the Arab armies at the Palestinian borders, the dispatching of weapons and ammunition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> and the contribution of a million pounds of financial aid to them. His proposals were rejected, other than the suggestion to send financial support, which was not followed up on. Nonetheless, a techno-military committee was established to coordinate assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Based in Cairo, it was directed by Sawfat, who was supported by Lebanese and Syrian officers {{and representatives of the}} Higher Arab Committee. A Transjordian delegate was also appointed, but he did not participate in meetings.|$|E

25|$|Collectively these 3 {{factors were}} {{considered}} to be responsible for causing 70% of the exodus, according to the IDF report. Furthermore, Morris states 'the report makes no mention of any blanket order issued over Arab radio stations or through other means, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to evacuate their homes and villages' despite as Morris states the IDF 'monitoring Arab radio transmissions'.|$|E
25|$|While {{all members}} of the party were doves as far as the Israeli general {{political}} spectrum was concerned, there were considerable difference of political strategy and tactics. One faction, headed by Ran Cohen—later a Knesset Member and cabinet minister for the Meretz party—held that Israeli peaceniks talking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> should strive to extract concessions from them, such as an official recognition of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Although a Religious Zionist, Bakshi-Doron was {{not afraid}} to buck the party line.

He stipulated that any agreement would have to allow for the Temple Mount to remain in Israeli hands.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, the West Bank water {{infrastructure}} {{controlled by the}} Israeli army was {{handed over to the}} Israeli national water company Mekorot. As of 2009, Mekorot operates some 42 wells in the West Bank, mainly in the Jordan Valley region, which mostly supply the Israeli settlements.

25|$|The 1995 Interim Agreement {{as part of}} the Oslo Peace Process {{provided}} certain {{quantities of}} water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> but prevents them from drilling any new wells in the Mountain Aquifer.

25|$|In 1993, {{with the}} {{transfer}} of increased control of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem from Israel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> PLO chairman Yasser Arafat appointed Sulaiman Ja'abari as Grand Mufti. When he died in 1994, Arafat appointed Ekrima Sa'id Sabri. Sabri was removed in 2006 by Palestinian National Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, who was concerned that Sabri was involved too heavily in political matters. Abbas appointed Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, who was perceived as a political moderate.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Arafat—wanting his admired, but loud-spoken, friend {{inside the}} leading circle—reappointed al-Hout to the PLO-EC. He {{then became a}} {{founding}} member of the Arab National Conference in 1992. In response to the 1993 Oslo Accords signed by Yasser Arafat, al-Hout resigned from his post in August 1993 in the PLO-EC along with Palestinian cultural chief Mahmoud Darwish and discontinued to represent the PLO at the UNGA. Al-Hout strongly advocated that all of historical Palestine belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> in one state, rejecting the two-state solution agreed on in the accords.|$|E
25|$|In May 1994, {{following}} the Palestinian-Israeli agreements {{known as the}} Oslo Accords, a phased transfer of governmental authority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> took place. Much of the Strip (except for the settlement blocs and military areas) came under Palestinian control. The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas. The Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters. In September 1995, Israel and the PLO signed a second peace agreement, extending the Palestinian Authority to most West Bank towns.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June, Abbas {{appointed}} Salam Fayyad {{as prime}} minister {{and gave him the}} task of forming a new government. The international community smoothly recognized the government. Within days, the US recognized Abbas' emergency government and ended a 15-month economic and political boycott of the Palestinian Authority in a bid to bolster President Abbas and the new Fatah-led government. The European Union similarly announced plans to resume direct aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> while Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said it would release to Abbas Palestinian tax revenues that Israel had withheld since Hamas took control of the Palestinian Parliament.|$|E

25|$|On September 28, 1995, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO {{chairman}} Yasser Arafat {{signed the}} Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in Washington. the agreement marked {{the conclusion of}} the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians recognized Israel's right to exist and promised to abstain from use of terror. However the agreement was opposed by the Hamas and other Palestinian factions, whom at this point were already committing suicide bomber attacks throughout Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{security}} {{of these resources}} is impacted by riparian conflicts. Several hundred million cubic meters of groundwater in the West Bank Mountain Aquifer are disputed between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the 1995 Interim Agreement {{as part of the}} Oslo Peace Process Israel provided 52 million cubic meters of water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in 2011, but prevents them from drilling new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan was Israel able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 48 million cubic meters of water per year were provided to Israel under the Peace Treaty in 2011.|$|E
25|$|According to the Palestinian Water Authority, {{the average}} Israeli {{consumption}} {{of water is}} 300 liter per person per day, {{which is more than}} 4 times that of the Palestinian use of 72 liters per day. Some Palestinian village communities live on even less water than the average Palestinian consumption, in some cases no more than 20 liters per person per day. According to the World Bank, water extractions per capita for West Bank Palestinians are about one quarter of those for Israelis, and have declined over the last decade. In 1999, Palestinians in the West Bank used only 190 lpcd from the West Bank resources, the settlers 870 lpcd, and the Israelis used even 1,000 lpcd. Israeli settlers in the West Bank thus used about 4.5 times the amount of water available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E

25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat {{signed the}} Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995 in Washington. The {{agreement}} was witnessed by President Bill Clinton {{on behalf of}} the United States and by Russia, Egypt, Norway and the European Union, and incorporates and supersedes the previous agreements, marking the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the Palestinian National Covenant, which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 and the elimination of Israel.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{his career}} in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress. He {{supports}} strong United States–Israel relations. He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to Palestinians.|$|E
