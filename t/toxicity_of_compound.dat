40|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{in the treatment of}} trypanosomiases has been achieved with the recent development of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT). As an alternative to drug combinations and as a means to overcome most of the antitrypanosomatid drug discovery challenges, a multitarget drug design strategy has been envisaged. To begin testing this hypothesis, we designed and developed a series of quinone-coumarin hybrids against glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase/trypanothione reductase (GAPDH/TR). These enzymes belong to metabolic pathways that are vital to Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, and have thus been considered promising drug targets. The synthesized molecules were characterized for their dual-target antitrypanosomal profile, both in enzyme assays and in in vitro parasite cultures. The merged derivative 2 -{[3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropoxy) - 2 -oxo- 2 H-chromen- 7 -yl]oxy}anthracene- 1, 4 -dione (10) showed an IC 50 value of 5. 4 μM against TbGAPDH and a concomitant Ki value of 2. 32 μM against TcTR.

We evaluated the O 2 −-scavenging activities of the compounds by a chemiluminescence method, and activation of ERK 1 / 2 in PC 12 cells was evaluated by Western blot analysis. At 166 μmol/L, the O 2 −-scavenging activities were markedly different among compounds A and B. 3 -(2, 6 -Dimethylphenyl) - 2 -selenoxo- 1, 3 -thiazolidin- 4 -one (compound Aa) exhibited the strongest superoxide anion-scavenging activity among compounds A and B. The concentration necessary for 50 % inhibition of the activity (IC 50) of compound Aa was 25. 9 μmol/L. Compound Aa activated ERK 1 / 2 of the PC 12 cell, as did ebselen, and suppressed hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity more potently than ebselen.

Extensive {{studies have shown}} that Agaricus subrufescens (A. blazei Murrill or A. brasiliensis) has anticancer properties. A comparative study of Agaricus subrufescens strains (from Brazil and France) is presented herein using Agaricus bisporus (champignon de Paris) as control. In vivo OCDE test were performed to evaluate either tolerance and/or acute and sub chronic toxicity in rats and mice. Our data reveal that all A. subrufescens strains are not toxic, either in vivo or in vitro, except some locomotor hypoactivity. All show a preventing effect against carcinogenesis, including A. bisporus.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} therapeutic advances, {{congestive heart}} failure (CHF) remains a medical and socioeconomic problem. CHF is usually treated with the plant-derived digitalis cardiac glycosides such as digoxin, which increase the force of contractions of failing cardiomyocytes and reduce cardiac conduction rate. However, the usage of digoxin in CHF has lessened considerably due to its narrow therapeutic window and high drug toxicity. This leads to a need for new drugs, particularly positive inotropic agents, which would not only {{improve the quality of}} life but also reduce mortality in CHF patients. So far, there has been a lack of desirable inotropic agent. With this aim in mind, an alternative drug namely 8 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2, 4 -dimethyl- 9 -((4 -methylpiperidin- 1 -yl) methyl) imidazo[1, 2 -a][1, 8]naphthyridine, abbreviated as compound [1], was chemically synthesized. Previous reports indicated that compound [1] has two significant advantages for CHF treatment. Firstly, it increases muscular contraction and decreases heart rate in anaesthetized rats. The fall in heart rate is desirable in the case of CHF because it allows the heart to function more efficiently. Secondly, it has a relaxant effect on the vascular smooth muscles of the aortic ring causing a drop in the systemic blood pressure, which is an added advantage in cardiovascular treatment. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies these effects remain unclear and the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> [1] especially its effects on the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2 +]i homeostasis and cell death in cultured cardiomyocytes have yet to be evaluated. Therefore, both of these aspects were investigated in this study. In addition, to discover more biologically active heterocyclic compounds, new imidazo[1, 2 -a][1, 8]naphthyridine derivative was synthesized. This compound was named GKL. The structure of GKL was identified from 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra and molecular weight was confirmed using the mass spectrum generated by LC-MS (NIST library). The potential of both compound [1] and GKL as positive inotropic agents were assessed via comparative analyses to digoxin using a standard in vitro experimental model, H 9 c 2 (2 - 1) cells, with a significant advantage of being an animal-free alternative. It was found that the mechanism of action of compound [1] and GKL might be through specific activation of L-type voltage calcium channel via G protein (β 1 -adrenoceptor) which was supported by the increased in cAMP (3 ′- 5 ′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) concentrations. Digoxin, besides inhibiting Na+, K+-ATPase, might activate ryanodine receptors in particular to exert positive inotropic effect. Although myocardial oxygen consumptions were increased in compound [1]- and GKL-treated cells, which reduces cardiac efficiency, this consumption did not differ significantly to that of the control. As toxicity evaluation is an important step in the early stages of drug discovery, <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> [1] and GKL was examined. Compound [1] and GKL were found to induce cell death in a time-dependent manner. The cells appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death and confirmed by Western blot analysis where compound [1] and GKL regulated both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signalling cascades. The most important finding was that GKL induced an influx of [Ca 2 +]i with reduced toxicity in mitochondria as compared to digoxin and compound [1], suggesting its potential application in targeting CHF. In summary, the positive inotropic action of compound [1] and GKL can potentially give hope to the therapeutic promise of medicine in the field of cardiovascular disease...|$|E

These complexes exhibit keto-enolic equilibria in aqueous solution, very dependent of pH, although isolated in the solid state in one defined form, and this type of equilibrium was previously verified to be crucial for their catalytic activity in the oxidation of carbohydrates, through intermediary generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, biological {{studies carried out with}} tumor cells of different origin such as human neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y) and promonocytic (U 937) cells showed that these compounds exert different toxicity. In particular, while compounds [Cu(isaen) (H 2 O) ]ClO 4 (.) 2 H(2) O 2, [Cu(isahist) (H 2 O) ](ClO 4) (2) 4 and [Cu(isa) (2) ]ClO 4 6 are not toxic for both cell lines at the concentrations used in this study, compounds [Cu(isapn) ](ClO 4) (2) 1, [Cu(isaep) (2) ](ClO 4) (2) (.) 2 H(2) O 3 and [Cu(isami) (H 2 O) ]-ClO 4 5 are cytotoxic, with the compound 3 being the most effective. In these compounds, isaen, isahist, isapn, isaepy and isami stand for imine ligands prepared by condensation of ethylenediamine (en), histamine (hist), 1, 3 -diaminopropane (pn), 2 -aminoethylpyridine (epy), and 8 -aminoquinoline (and) with isatin (isa). Cells treated with these compounds were committed to the apoptotic program as evidenced by cytofluorimetric analyses of cell cycle. Moreover, the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> 5 was equivalent for both cell lines while the compound 1 was almost not toxic at 24 h for SH-SY 5 Y cells where only an arrest in G 1 phase was observed. Compound 3 was more efficient in inducing cell death and also in this case a striking effect on U 937 cells (apoptotic cells 68 % compared with 11 % of SH-SY 5 Y) was observed. Therefore, the results indicated that their activity seems to be cell type specific. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic lipid A analogs (compounds 404 through 406) were {{examined}} for their immunopharmacological activities. These compounds had two amide-bound and two ester-bound (R) - 3 -hydroxytetradecanoyl {{groups at the}} C- 2 and C- 2 ' and the C- 3 and C- 3 ' positions, respectively, of beta (1 - 3) glucosamine disaccharide. In all of the in vitro assays, these synthetic compounds exhibited high activities {{comparable to those of}} a reference lipid A prepared from Escherichia coli O 8 :K 27 Re-mutant strain F 515. The compounds activated the clotting enzyme cascade of the horseshoe crab, activated the human complement via the classical pathway, caused polyclonal B-cell activation, stimulated the phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes by murine peritoneal macrophages, and enhanced the migration of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. They also increased the thymidine uptake of splenocytes of BALB/c nu/nu and C 3 H/HeN mice but not those of C 3 H/HeJ (a nonresponder to lipopolysaccharide). A dephosphorylated derivative, compound 403, was barely active in all of the above assays except for the enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration. However, compounds 404 through 406 were feeble in pyrogenicity and could not prepare the local Shwartzman reaction, although they were very lethal to galactosamine-loaded mice. Therefore, synthetic lipid A analogs described here were fully immunopharmacologically active in in vitro assays, but all of them were far less active than natural E. coli F 515 lipid A regarding the biological activities characteristic of endotoxic lipopolysaccharides and lipid A's. The high lethal <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> 406 (1, 4 '-bisphosphate) to the galactosamine-loaded mice may not reflect its real toxicity to normal mice. In all activities examined, compound 406 was quite comparable to a biosynthetic lipid A precursor, a natural counterpart of compound 406. The immunopharmacological activities of these newly synthesized lipid A analogs, especially compound 406, were much stronger than those of compounds that had been synthesized earlier by using the originally proposed model of the lipid A structure. The findings described in this report justify the acylation pattern of a disaccharide backbone of lipid A, revised on the basis of recent analytical studies. The low in vivo endotoxic activities of the present lipid A analogs are most probably {{due to the fact that}} the kinds of acyl groups were different from those of the complete lipid A from E. coli, although there were no differences in the acylation positions on the disaccharide backbone...|$|E
