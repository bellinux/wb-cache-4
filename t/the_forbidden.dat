5|$|While {{development}} is now tightly controlled {{in the vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>Forbidden</b> City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Forbidden</b> City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for <b>the</b> <b>Forbidden</b> City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.|$|E

40|$|Minimal {{forbidden}} {{factors are}} {{a useful tool}} for investigating properties of words and languages. Two factorial languages are distinct if and only if they have different (antifactorial) sets of minimal forbidden factors. There exist algorithms for computing <b>the</b> minimal <b>forbidden</b> factors of a word, as well as of a regular factorial language. Conversely, Crochemore et al. ~[IPL, 1998] gave an algorithm that, given the trie recognizing a finite antifactorial language $M$, computes a DFA recognizing the language having $M$ as set of minimal <b>forbidden</b> factors. In <b>the</b> same paper, they showed that the obtained DFA is minimal if the input trie recognizes <b>the</b> minimal <b>forbidden</b> factors of a single word. We generalize this result to the case of a circular word. We also discuss combinatorial properties of <b>the</b> minimal <b>forbidden</b> factors of a circular word. Finally, we characterize <b>the</b> minimal <b>forbidden</b> factors of <b>the</b> circular Fibonacci words. Comment: Extended version. Submitted to journa...|$|R
