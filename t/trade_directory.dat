In 1848, 5 shipwrights, 4 rope- and line-makers, 6 sail-makers and 4 mast-, pump-, and block-makers are listed in a local <b>trade</b> <b>directory.</b> Hewett & Co continued in boat building and repair until 1899. Other industries replaced the nautical trades, including jute spinning, paint and chemicals manufacture. By 1878 Daniel de Pass had opened the Barking Guano Works (later de Pass Fertilisers Ltd, part of Fisons) at Creekmouth. Creekmouth was also {{the site of the}} major Barking Power Station from 1925 until the 1970s, burning coal shipped in by river; the current station known as Barking is further east near Dagenham Dock. In the 20th century new industrial estates were established, and many local residents came to be employed in the car plant at Dagenham.|$|E

2500|$|The {{way of life}} in {{the village}} changed little over the centuries as the farming was always the mixed inbyland and open moors system.

An 1823 <b>trade</b> <b>directory</b> lists 17 farmers, four shoemakers, three corn millers, two blacksmiths, two butchers, two victuallers (one also a tallow chandler), a tailor, a wheelwright, and a [...] "blue, brown, and shop paper manufacturer" [...] in Lealholm. The Industrial Revolution absorbed some of the local population as the nearby boom town of Middlesbrough expanded its iron and steel industry but essentially, in this remote area, the farming economy survived until after the Second World War and the mechanisation of agriculture.|$|E

[...] The gardens were opposite Montpelier Crescent, a South Downs-facing development built between 1843 and 1847. [...] In 1856, a <b>trade</b> <b>directory</b> stated that 16 houses had been built {{on the west side of}} the former Montpelier Road, which by that time had been renamed along most of its length: the stretch opposite Montpelier Crescent had been called Vernon Terrace.

2500|$|William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland instigated an {{irrigation}} {{scheme of}} flood meadows for [...] along {{the course of}} the River Maun between Carr Bank Wood, Mansfield and the parish boundary between Edwinstowe and Ollerton. The flood meadows were intended to increase the yield of hay to feed flocks of sheep during the winter. The scheme cost almost £40,000 and was notable by the philanthropic nature of the high wages that the Duke offered to pay the construction labourers in a time of high unemployment created by the mechanisation of industry and the recent wars against Napoleon. The flood meadows passed through the heart of Clipstone Park, and the construction of them seems to have taken its toll on the preservation of the King's Houses.

2500|$|Artistic {{activity}} in late Georgian Birmingham was {{not restricted to}} landscape painting. A century later the London-based Magazine of Art could describe Birmingham as [...] "perhaps the most artistic town in England", and the changes {{that would result in}} this transformation had already started by the 1780s. A local <b>trade</b> <b>directory</b> of 1785 lists twenty four professional artists, including the portraitist James Millar, the still life painter Moses Haughton and the portrait miniature painter James Bisset. Of widest influence was the Birmingham School of engravers – a separate group to the landscape artists but emerging similarly from the drawing academies of Joseph Barber, Vincent Barber and Samuel Lines. Formed around the younger Barber's pupils William Radclyffe, James Tibbitts Willmore and John Pye, and Lines' pupil William Wyon, this group were to dominate high-quality European printmaking in the 1850s and 1860s and revolutionise the art of book illustration, bringing contemporary art to a much wider public than ever before.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930 the {{government}} introduced the Road Traffic Act. In 1931 Richardson started the Borough Motor Traffic Police unit, specially concentrating on motor vehicles. A document from the Metropolitan Police Force, London, {{was sent to}} Halifax which the Force implemented and was distributed to the Policemen. The Chief Constable wrote in a memorandum dated 1 January 1931: [...] "The Road Traffic Act of 1930 places a responsibility on the Police in the Borough {{which can only be}} discharged by the organisation of efficient motor patrols throughout the County." [...] Richardson purchased two vans which, from 3 August 1931, were used to enforce the new regulations that had just been brought in. Their use was mainly connected with speed limits in built-up areas in the Borough. Richardson continued his involvement with the local population by encouraging swimming and life-saving lessons and giving awards at the Woodside Baths, Halifax. In 1935 he was awarded the King's Silver Jubilee Medal. The well known Person and <b>Trade</b> <b>Directory</b> Kellys always listed the Chief Constable of Halifax when new editions were printed.
