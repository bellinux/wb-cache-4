50|$|The Mozambique {{government}} confiscated all of {{the animals}} and placed them {{in the care of}} ADI. The <b>python,</b> <b>tigers</b> and lions were confiscated for CITES and import permit contraventions, in addition to welfare reasons. The horses were rehomed in Mozambique and the lions, <b>tigers,</b> <b>pythons</b> and dogs were moved to South Africa where they spent some time in quarantine whilst waiting for a permanent home.|$|R
50|$|In Bring ‘Em Back Alive, {{unlike in}} most other jungle {{pictures}} of the time, Elliott kept the camera in the background. Neither the camera nor the cameramen are visible in any of thescenes. The result is an infinitely clearer conception of the clashes between <b>tigers,</b> <b>pythons</b> and crocodiles than had been achieved in previous films. The movie was a huge hit, Elliott's (and Frank Buck's) most successful and popular film.|$|R
5000|$|He is also {{referred}} to as [...] "The Honey Badger". When asked why, he said [...] "It's supposed to be the most fearless animal in the animal kingdom. When you look at it, he seems quite cute and cuddly, but as soon as someone crosses his territory in a way he doesn't like, he turns into a bit of a savage and he'll go after anything - <b>tigers,</b> <b>pythons</b> - he turns very quickly, but he's a good guy". He wears an image of a honey badger {{on the back of his}} helmet.|$|R
50|$|Animal species include leaf monkey, gibbon, douc langur, gaur, giant muntjac, dhole, jackal, <b>tiger,</b> pangolin, <b>python</b> {{and king}} cobra. Two herds of wild {{elephants}} are {{known in the}} park.|$|R
50|$|Its {{appearance}} is not known, {{because of the}} fragmentary nature of its fossil remains. It possibly resembled modern gorillas, because of its supposedly similar lifestyle. Some scientists, however, think it probably looked more like its closest modern relative, the orangutan. Based on the upper estimates, Gigantopithecus possibly had few or no enemies when fully grown. However, younger, weak, or injured individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by <b>tigers,</b> <b>pythons,</b> crocodiles, machairodonts, hyenas, bears, and Homo erectus. Based on the lower estimates, however, even fully grown individuals may have been vulnerable to predation by the animals mentioned above other than pythons and hyenas.|$|R
50|$|After 48 {{hours of}} combat, the VNA began {{to gain the}} upper hand. Le Grand Monde, {{previously}} Bảy Viễn’s largest gambling establishment, and temporarily serving as a Bình Xuyên citadel, was overrun by Diệm’s paratroopers after a struggle which caused heavy losses on both sides. The VNA then stormed one of the Bình Xuyên’s most heavily fortified strongholds, the Petrus Ký High School in Cholon. By the time Collins had arrived back in South Vietnam on May 2, the battle was almost won. The Bình Xuyên forces were broken and in retreat and their command posts were levelled. Bảy Viễn’s headquarters was battered and his <b>tigers,</b> <b>pythons</b> and crocodiles inside {{had been killed by}} mortar attacks and shelling.|$|R

50|$|Kankaria Zoo, officially Kamla Nehru Zoological Garden, was {{established}} by Rueben David in 1951 spread over 21 acres. It was rated the best zoo in Asia in 1974. They are 450 mammals, 2,000 birds, 140 reptiles in a 31-acre zoo. It houses wild animals like <b>tigers,</b> lions, <b>python,</b> anaconda, snakes, elephants, albino (white) animals like the rhesus monkey, spotted deer, white blackbuck, chinkara, elephant, emu, jungle babbler, bush-quail and common palm civet. Kankaria Zoo has also bred of rare species like pythons, crocodiles, bearcats and wild asses. Reuben David was awarded Padma Shri in 1974 for it.|$|R

50|$|The main predators of the Thylogale stigmatica are dingos, <b>tiger</b> quolls, amethystine <b>pythons</b> and {{domestic}} dogs. The rate of predation increases following a forest fire, {{when there is}} less forest cover. They detect predators by spreading out when foraging. Each pademelon can watch for predators on its particular area. If a predator is seen, a warning {{to others in the}} area is spread by a thumping sound made by the hind legs.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1950s, {{the place}} {{was a part of}} a huge and dense jungle known as Charkoshe-Jhaadi teeming with all kinds of wild animals and plants {{including}} Royal Bengal <b>Tigers,</b> one-horned rhinoceroses, <b>pythons,</b> bears, antelopes, and so on, with not a single human being daring to settle in there. Men coming down from the high mountain regions like Lamjung, Tanahun/Tanhun, Gorkha etc., started clearing jungles to make space for a new place to live in and to make land for the essential agriculture.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} genetic variability within Spirometra erinacei (Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea) from different host species and geographical origins in Australia using a {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) -based mutation detection approach, followed by DNA sequencing. Part of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (p cox 1) was amplified by PCR, scanned for sequence variation by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and representative samples from different host species were selected for DNA sequencing. While no variation in SSCP profiles was detected among S. erinacei samples from dog, fox, cat, <b>tiger</b> snake and <b>python,</b> they differed in profile from 5 specimens from the green tree frog (Litoria caerulea). This was supported by sequence data which demonstrated that p cox 1 sequences of samples from the latter host species differed at 8 of 393 (2 %) nucleotide positions from those from the non-amphibian host. Using a nucleotide difference in the p cox 1 sequence, a PCR-linked {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) could be employed to unequivocally delineate between samples from non-amphibian and amphibian hosts. These findings demonstrate the existence of at least two genotypes within S. erinacei, which may have important implications for studying the epidemiology, ecology and systematics of this cestode...|$|R
50|$|Known {{predation}} {{records are}} by the barn owl Tyto alba, the masked owl T. novaehollandiae, the sooty owl T. tenebricosa, the barking owl Ninox connivens, the brown antechinus Antechinus stuartii, the tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus, the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii, the dingo Canis lupus dingo, the dog Canis lupus familiaris, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, the cat Felis catus, Stephen's banded snake Hoplocephalus stephensii, and the rough-scaled snake Tropidechis carinatus. In {{a study of}} the impacts of logging on the species, conducted in McPherson State Forest, not far from Gosford, high rates of predation were found with six of 61 radio-tracked pygmy-possums taken by reptiles (<b>tiger</b> snakes, diamond <b>pythons,</b> and goannas) and two by raptors such as sooty owls with other predators such as native Antechinus and feral cats and foxes noted. A sooty owl pellet investigation found that pygmy possums comprised 15% of the 126 dietary items identified. The study's authors suggested that the species is vulnerable to altered predation regimes, such as influxes of feral predators, and highlights the need for a better understanding of any influence of logging on predator activity.|$|R
5000|$|After repulsing the Song {{invasion}} of 981, Lê Hoàn pursued {{a policy of}} reconciliation with the Song Empire. He sent diplomats to the Song court in Dongjing and received Song emissaries in Hoa Lư. In addition, he consented to the Song Emperor's offers to award him traditional titles held by top Chinese officials during the Tang-era Chinese occupation of Vietnam: [...] "Governor of Annam", and [...] "Peaceful Sea Military Governor." [...] However, he refused to genuflect before a Chinese emissary, giving the phony excuse of being {{unable to do so}} due to an injury, and attempted to intimidate the emissary with displays of military force and bizarre gifts of a <b>tiger</b> and a <b>python.</b> On one occasion, Lê Hoàn assigned a learned monk named Đỗ Thuận to impersonate a menial servant and to impress a Chinese diplomat with his literary acumen, and thus to convey the impression that the ordinary people of the realm were skilled in Chinese poetry and speech. Thus, Lê Hoàn complied with Emperor Taizong's demand for recognition, {{while at the same time}} signalling his own independence and potential for belligerence.|$|R
50|$|Tiger quolls live in {{a variety}} of habitats, but seem to prefer wet forests such as rainforests and closed {{eucalypt}} forest. They are arboreal, but only moderately, as 11% of their travelling is done above ground. Prey items eaten by quolls include insects, crayfish, lizards, snakes, birds, domestic poultry, small mammals, platypus, rabbits, arboreal possums, pademelons, small wallabies, and wombats. They may scavenge larger prey such as kangaroos, feral pigs, cattle, and dingoes. However, the tiger quoll does not scavenge as much as the Tasmanian devil. Much of the prey eaten by the quoll are arboreal. They can climb high into trees and make nocturnal hunts for possums and birds. The flexibility of their diets suggests their prey base is not detrimentally affected by bushfires. When hunting, a quoll stalks its prey, stopping only when its head is up. It then launches its attack, executing a killing bite {{to the base of the}} skull or top of the neck, depending on the size of the prey. The quoll will pin small prey down with its fore paws and then deliver the bite. With large prey, it jumps and latches on its back and bites the neck. Quolls, in turn, may be preyed on by Tasmanian devils and masked owls in Tasmania and dingos and dogs in mainland Australia. It may also be preyed on by wedge-tailed eagles and large <b>pythons.</b> <b>Tiger</b> quolls yield to adult devils, but will chase subadults away from carcasses. Quolls also probably compete with introduced carnivores, such as foxes, cats, and wild dogs. Tiger quolls are also hosts to numerous species of endoparasites.|$|R
