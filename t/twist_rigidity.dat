40|$|A {{generalization}} of the Euler–Plateau problem {{to account for}} the energy contribution due to twisting of the bounding loop is proposed. Euler–Lagrange equations are derived in a param-eterized setting and a bifurcation analysis is performed. A pair of dimensionless parameters govern bifurcations from a flat, circular ground state. While one of these is familiar from the Euler–Plateau problem, the other encompasses information about the ratio of the <b>twisting</b> to bending <b>rigidities,</b> <b>twist,</b> and size of the loop. For sufficiently small values of the latter pa-rameter, two separate groups of bifurcation modes are identified. On the other hand, for values greater than the critical twist arising in Michell’s problem of the bifurcation of a twisted annular ring, only one bifurcation mode exists. Bifurcation diagrams indicate that a loop with greater <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidity</b> shows more resistance to transverse buckling. However, a twisted and closed filament spanned by a surface endowed with uniform surface tension buckles at a twist less than the critical value for an elastic ring. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{flexural}} and <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidities</b> of orthotropic plates. Asymmetrically stiffened plates are examples of technically orthotropic plates and are found in civil engineering structures such as bridges and ribbed floor slabs. The formulae for the rigidities as {{found in the literature}} are reviewed. The writer has devised an experimental method of determining the rigidities. This involves a bending test using the Moire technique and a twisting test. In the writer's method only one model is needed to determine all the rigidities. This is compared to other methods for which two or three models are needed. Sixteen different models of asymmetrically stiffened plates with ribs running in one direction only were made. The flexural rigidities of eight of these models and the <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidities</b> of all sixteen models were determined. The objective of the tests was to compare the test values with the theoretical values. More specifically the objective can be defined as follows. a) To determine how well an asymmetrically stiffened plate behaves as an orthotropic plate, i. e. how far apart may the ribs be spaced before the plate becomes a system of plate elements and beam elements. b) To determine the influence, if any, on the rigidities Dx, D₁ and Dy of altering the spacing of the ribs of stiffened plates which have the same theoretical values of Dx. c) To determine whether there is any difference between the rigidities D₁₂ and D₂₁, which are the same for a true orthotropic plate and are usually assumed to be the same for an asymmetrically stiffened plate.

40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} progress in understanding the properties of supercoiled DNA has been obtained due to nanotechniques that made stretching and twisting of single molecules possible. Quantitative interpretation of such experiments requires accurate knowledge of torques inside manipulated DNA. This paper argues {{that it is not}} possible to transfer the entire magnitudes of external torques to the twisting stress of the double helix, and that a reducing torque transfer coefficient (TTC< 1) should always be assumed. This assertion agrees with simple physical intuition and is supported by the results of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. According to MD, the TTCs around 0. 8 are observed in nearly optimal conditions. Reaching higher values requires special efforts and it should be difficult in practice.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of multivalent counterion-induced bundle formation by filamentous actin (F-actin) is studied using a coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulation. Real diameter size, helically ordered charge distribution and <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity</b> of F-actin {{are taken into}} account in our model. The attraction between parallel F-actins induced by multivalent counterions is studied in detail and it is found that the maximum attraction occurs between their closest charged domains. The model F-actins aggregate due to the like-charge attraction and form closely packed bundles. Counterions are mostly distributed in the narrowest gaps between neighboring F-actins inside the bundles and the channels between three adjacent F-actins correspond to low density of the counterions. Density of the counterions varies periodically with a wave length comparable to the separation between consecutive G-actin monomers along the actin polymers. Long-lived defects in the hexagonal order of F-actins in the bundles are observed that their number increases with increasing the bundles size. Combination of electrostatic interactions and <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity</b> has been found not to change the symmetry of F-actin helical conformation from the native 13 / 6 symmetry. Calculation of zero-temperature energy of hexagonally ordered model F-actins with the charge of the counterions distributed as columns of charge domains representing counterion charge density waves has shown that helical symmetries commensurate with the hexagonal lattice correspond to local minima of the energy of the system. The global minimum of energy corresponds to 24 / 11 symmetry with the columns of charge domains arranged in the narrowest gaps between the neighboring F-actins.

We construct the stability diagram that describes the buckling transition of such ribbons under the opposing action of force and torque and show that all the predicted behaviors can be understood in terms of continuous transformations between straight and spiral/helical states of the ribbon.

40|$|Protein-induced DNA looping {{is crucial}} for many genetic {{processes}} such as transcription, gene regulation and DNA replication. Here, we use tethered-particle motion to {{examine the impact of}} DNA bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidity</b> on loop capture and release, using the restriction endonuclease FokI as a test system. To cleave DNA efficiently, FokI bridges two copies of an asymmetric sequence, invariably aligning the sites in parallel. On account of the fixed alignment, the topology of the DNA loop is set by the orientation of the sites along the DNA. We show that both the separation of the FokI sites and their orientation, altering, respectively, the twisting and the bending of the DNA needed to juxtapose the sites, have profound effects on the dynamics of the looping interaction. Surprisingly, the presence of a nick within the loop does not affect the observed rigidity of the DNA. In contrast, the introduction of a 4 -nt gap fully relaxes all of the torque present in the system but does not necessarily enhance loop stability.

40|$|Introduction The {{statistics}} of directed walks constitute a fundamental statistical mechanics problem. This problem, {{apart from its}} theoretical interest, is of great practical importance in polymer physics {{as it can be}} used to describe the extension of a molecular chain under tension. For modest applied tensions, a polymer's elasticity is largely determined by entropic considerations. The statistical mechanical link thus connects the macroscopic force versus extension relation to the microscopic bend rigidity of the polymer. In this poster we investigate the statistical mechanics of a slightly more complicated system. The system consists of a chain that has a <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity</b> as well as a bend rigidity. This problem is also of some practical importance. Unlike many polymers, biopolymers such as actin and DNA are not free to rotate about the links between successive monomers.

The conjecture that physical loops exhibit additional rigidity on scales comparable to the entire loop due to the contribution of <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity,</b> can be tested experimentally by determining the persistence length from the local curvature and comparing it with that obtained by measuring the radius of gyration of dsDNA plasmids.

40|$|Bundles of {{filamentous}} polymers are primary structural {{components of}} {{a broad range of}} cytoskeletal structures, and their mechanical properties play key roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion to mechanotransduction and fertilization. We give a detailed derivation of a wormlike bundle model as a generic description for the statics and dynamics of polymer bundles consisting of semiflexible polymers interconnected by crosslinking agents. The elastic degrees of freedom include bending as well as twist deformations of the filaments and shear deformation of the crosslinks. We show that a competition between the elastic properties of the filaments and those of the crosslinks leads to renormalized effective bend and <b>twist</b> <b>rigidities</b> that become mode-number dependent. The strength and character of this dependence is found to vary with bundle architecture, such as the arrangement of filaments in the cross section and pretwist. We discuss two paradigmatic cases of bundle architecture, a uniform arrangement of filaments as found in F-actin bundles and a shell-like architecture as characteristic for microtubules. Each architecture is found to have its own universal ratio of maximal to minimal bending rigidity, independent of the specific type of crosslink induced filament coupling; our predictions are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data for microtubules. Moreover, we analyze the predictions of the wormlike bundle model for experimental observables such as the tangent-tangent correlation function and dynamic response and correlation functions. Finally, we analyze the effect of pretwist (helicity) on the mechanical properties of bundles. We predict that microtubules with different number of protofilaments should have distinct variations in their effective bending rigidity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} general model of actin {{filament}} deformation and fragmentation {{in response to}} compressive forces. The elastic free energy density along filaments is determined by their shape and mechanical properties, which were modeled in terms of bending, twisting, and twist-bend coupling elasticities. The elastic energy stored in filament deformation (i. e., strain) tilts the fragmentation-annealing reaction free-energy profile to favor fragmentation. The energy gradient introduces a local shear force that accelerates filament intersubunit bond rupture. The severing protein, cofilin, renders filaments more compliant in bending and twisting. As a result, filaments that are partially decorated with cofilin are mechanically heterogeneous (i. e., nonuniform) and display asymmetric shape deformations and energy profiles distinct from mechanically homogenous (i. e., uniform), bare actin, or saturated cofilactin filaments. The local buckling strain depends on the relative size of the compliant segment {{as well as the}} bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidities</b> of flanking regions. Filaments with a single bare/cofilin-decorated boundary localize energy and force adjacent to the boundary, within the compliant cofilactin segment. Filaments with small cofilin clusters were predicted to fragment within the compliant cofilactin rather than at boundaries. Neglecting contributions from twist-bend coupling elasticity underestimates the energy density and gradients along filaments, and thus the net effects of filament strain to fragmentation. Spatial confinement causes compliant cofilactin segments and filaments to adopt higher deformation modes and store more elastic energy, thereby promoting fragmentation. The theory and simulations presented here establish a quantitative relationship between actin filament fragmentation thermodynamics and elasticity, and reveal how local discontinuities in filament mechanical properties introduced by regulatory proteins can modulate both the severing efficiency and location along filaments. The emergent behavior of mechanically heterogeneous filaments, particularly under confinement, emphasizes that severing in cells is likely to be influenced by multiple physical and chemical factors...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} accepted that thermal fluctuations take active part in functional tasks of biological molecules. We employ a set of coarse-grained models to investigate the mechanism of transmission of allosteric signal via spatial fluctuations. Our models are coarser than those in computational techniques established in molecular biology, but allow for both the identification of candidates for the essential physical structures and also the analytical determination of thermodynamic quantities that define ligand binding. The models are constructed for general classes of macromolecules and are validated through parameterisation from experiments and atomistic simulations. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we investigate the “dynamic allostery” in dimeric proteins composed of two identical subunits. We demonstrate that cooperative effects upon binding of two identical ligands can arise purely through modification of slow global vibrational modes of the protein. We parameterise the model on a test case, the CAP homodimer. Finally, we explain the role of local, fast vibrations in the allosteric effect and propose a general protocol for interpreting thermodynamic parameters of dynamically allosteric homodimers. The second part of this thesis considers allosteric effects in DNA, an example of nearly uniform elastic medium. The DNA is modeled as an elastic rod and substrate binding as local increase of its bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>rigidity.</b> This results in altered structure of normal modes and leads to qualitatively different type of dynamic allostery compared to that of the discrete models previously employed to study allosteric effects in proteins. Dynamic allostery in DNA is found always to be negative, due to an anti-correlated amplitude of thermal fluctuations at the binding site and around it. This allows us to draw conclusions about general design rules of allosteric molecules and highlight the controlling feature that biological molecules evolved to optimize their dynamics for their function. ...|$|R

The rod like chain in presence of the cutoff is able to reproduce quantitatively the experimentally observed effects of supercoiling on the elongation-force characteristics, in the small supercoiling regime. An exact solution of the model, using both transfer matrix techniques and its mapping to a quantum mechanics problem, allows to extract, from the experimental data,the value of the <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity.</b> We also analyse the variation of the torque and the writhe to twist ratio versus supercoiling, showing analytically the existence of a rather sharp crossover regime which can be related to the excitation of plectonemic-like structures.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{statistical}} mechanics of a torsionally constrained polymer. The polymer is modeled as a fluctuating rod with bend stiffness Ak BT and twist stiffness Ck BT. In such a model, thermal bend fluctuations couple geometrically to an applied torque through the relation Lk = Tw + Wr. A general treatment of this coupling is complicated, {{and so we}} restrict ourselves to explorations of two limiting cases. ^ In the first case, we consider polymers which are nearly extended under tension. We develop a theory based on a phantom chain model to describe the geometric coupling and compare its predictions to recent single λ-DNA molecule experiments. Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is obtained using C = 109 nm. The analysis we develop further predicts a thermal reduction of the effective <b>twist</b> <b>rigidity</b> induced by bend fluctuations. ^ In the second case, we consider the zero tension limit in which the polymer retracts into an entropic coil.

40|$|A new Monte Carlo (MC) {{algorithm}} is proposed for simulating inextensible circular chains with finite <b>twisting</b> and bending <b>rigidity.</b> This new algorithm samples the relevant Riemann volume elements in a uniform manner, when the constraining potential vanishes. Simulations are performed for filaments comprising 170 subunits, each containing approximately 28 bp, which corresponds to a DNA length of 4770 bp. The bending rigidity is chosen to yield a persistence length, P = 500 A, and the intersubunit potential is taken to be a hard-cylinder potential with diameter d = 50 A. This value of d yields the same second virial coefficient as the electrostatic potential obtained by numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for 150 mM salt. Simulations are performed for unknotted circles and also for trefoil knotted circles using two different values of the torsional rigidity, C = (2. 0 and 3. 0) x 10 (- 19) dyne cm 2. In the case of unknotted circles, the simulated supercoiling free energy varies practically quadratically with linking difference delta l. The simulated twist energy parameter ET, its slope dET/dT, and the mean reduced writhe /delta l for C = 3 x 10 (- 19) dyne cm 2 all agree well with recent simulations for unknotted circles using the polygon-folding algorithm with identical P, d, and C. The simulated ET vs. delta l data for C = 2. 0 x 10 (- 19) dyne cm 2 agree rather well with recent experimental data for p 30 delta DNA (4752 bp), for which the torsional rigidity, C = 2. 07 x 10 (- 19) dyne cm 2, was independently measured. The experimental data for p 30 delta are enormously {{more likely to have}} arisen from C = 2. 0 x 10 (- 19) than from C = 3. 0 x 10 (- 19) dyne cm 2. Serious problems with the reported experimental assessments of ET for pBR 322 and their comparison with simulated data are noted. In the case of a trefoil knotted DNA, the simulated value, (ET) tre, exceeds that of the unknotted DNA, (ET) unk, by approximately equal to 1. 40 -fold at magnitude of delta l = 1. 0, but declines to a plateau about 1. 09 -fold larger than (ET) unk when magnitude of delta l > or = 15. Although the predicted ratio, (ET) tre/(ET) unk approximately equal to 1. 40, agrees fairly well with recent experimental measurements on a 5600 -bp DNA, the individual measured ET values, like some of those reported for pBR 322, are so large that they cannot be simulated using P = 500 A, d = 50 A, and any previous experimental estimate of C...|$|R
