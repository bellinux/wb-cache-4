5000|$|The {{rolling moment}} {{created by the}} {{side-slip}} (labelled as [...] "P") tends <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> the aircraft back to wings level. More dihedral effect tries <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> the wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> the wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction less strongly. Dihedral effect helps stabilise the spiral mode by tending <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> the wings toward level {{in proportion to the}} amount of side-slip that builds up. It's not the whole picture however. At the same time that angle of side-slip is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of side-slip that can be present. If there is no side-slip, there can be no restoring rolling moment. If there is less side-slip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability created by the vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> the wings back level by limiting side-slip.|$|R
