5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>in</b> Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>in</b> 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E

The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> <b>In</b> 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court.
