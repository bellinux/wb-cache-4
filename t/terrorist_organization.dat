40|$|In {{this study}} {{we have tried to}} derive a linkage map of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> in India, using the methods of Social Network Analysis. The {{presence}} of links between <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> has been inferred from media reports of terrorist violence, where the frequency of co-occurrence of names of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> {{has been used as a}} basis for inferring intensity of links. The groupings effected by SNA based on textual links alone correctly displayed ideological and regional groupings of the <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations.</b> Our analysis correctly identified the major groups of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> operating in the country and their linkages to international <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations.</b> Using betweenness centrality we were able to mark out key players such as the ISI of Pakistan, in spite of its having a relatively low intensity of links. The role of ISI in terrorism in India is well known and borne out by conventional analysis. Other prominent organizations were the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The methodology used in this paper is likely to be useful for strategic analysis based either on open source or intelligence (classified) data...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach in}} the discipline of International Relations is to treat <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> as "non-state" actors of international relations. However, this approach is problematic {{due to the fact}} that most <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> are backed or exploited by some states. In this article, I take issue with the non-stateness of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> and seek to answer the question of why so many states, at times, support <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations.</b> I argue that in the face of rising threats to national security in an age of devastating wars, modern nation states tend to provide support to foreign <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> that work against their present and imminent enemies. I elaborate on my argument studying three cases of state support for terrorism: Iranian support for Hamas, Syrian support for the PKK, and American support for the MEK. The analyses suggest that, for many states, terror is nothing but war by other means...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization</b> and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explain the {{creation}} of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> by political parties. Extant literature argues that institutional structural constraints, such as electoral systems, are more likely to lead political parties to create <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations.</b> However, this article hypothesizes that party ideology is also an important factor that explains the creation of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> by political parties. Using a Poisson random effect model for panel data on twenty-eight countries between 1965 and 2003, this article shows that party ideology is positively correlated with the formation of <b>terrorist</b> <b>organizations</b> even after controlling for institutional structural constraints. The implication of these findings is important for policy makers eager to create stable polities. domestic terrorism; domestic politics; regime ideology; government constraints; terror networks...|$|R

5|$|In 2008, DiCaprio {{starred in}} Body of Lies, a spy film {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization,</b> and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown {{contacts}} for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975).

5|$|The {{premise of}} Alien Soldier is {{provided}} with a long text scroll {{at the start of}} the game. After the game has begun, it is not referred to again.

A <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization</b> known as Scarlet rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A-Humans and A-Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone else out. During the height of Scarlet's power, an assassination attempt on the group's leader, Epsilon-Eagle, was carried out by a special forces group. Scarlet fought back with their powers, and the battle somehow breached the space-time continuum. Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into the continuum.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} written {{for most of its}} 155-issue run by comic book writer, artist, and editor Larry Hama, and was notable for its realistic, character-based {{storytelling}} style, unusual for a toy comic at the time. Hama wrote the series spontaneously, never knowing how a story would end until it was finished, but worked closely with the artists, giving them sketches of the characters and major scenes. While most stories involved the G.I. Joe Team battling against the forces of Cobra Command, an evil <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization,</b> many also focused on the relationships and background stories of the characters. Hama created most characters in collaboration with Hasbro, and used a system of file cards {{to keep track of the}} personalities and fictional histories of his characters, which later became a major selling point for the action figure line.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{inspired}} by Breizh Atao's message, Célestin Lainé, a reserve artillery officer, gathered {{a small group}} of companions to found Gwenn ha du, a <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization</b> advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through direct action. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France. Lainé was arrested, however he was released after a former coworker provided him with an alibi. Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections. Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lainé was working at the Kuhlmann plant in Loos, French Flanders. There he established links with Flemish nationalists, who introduced him to , an Abwehr agent, who converted Lainé into Nordic neopaganism. Lainé returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army. Lainé's most trusted supporters from the two groups were placed in Service Spécial, a secret special operations unit.|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a <b>terrorist</b> <b>organization</b> (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E
