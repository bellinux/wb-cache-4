2500|$|The Sherritt {{home was}} a typical period two-room slab hut, which Dan {{could see through the}} bedroom and kitchen to Joe in the back. When Weekes had first knocked, Constable William Duross had been talking with Sherritt and his wife in the kitchen. He joined the three other policemen, Henry Armstrong, Thomas P. Dowling, and Robert Alexander, in the bedroom. Even though they were big men, well-armed and {{experienced}} [...] "protectors", they remained <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> in fear while Sherritt was shot. Byrne then told Ellen Barry to open {{the front door of the}} hut. When she did, Dan Kelly was revealed a few feet away. Joe ordered the frightened women to leave the house, then the outlaws began shooting into the walls of the bedroom. The police threw themselves to the floor.|$|E
60|$|This {{conviction}} came to {{him with}} terrible force out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Father Rocco, neither {{your words}} nor your manner satisfy me. You speak in riddles; and you sit <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> with your face hidden from me--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same <b>dark</b> and diabolical manner, he {{repeated}} his success; {{and came back}} with a bag of money and {{not so much as a}} shoestring.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not reply}} categorically. Standing <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{sheltering}} <b>dark,</b> she said, [...] "Papa, I wasn't very candid with you, this afternoon. I am engaged to Mr. Burnamy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huldy {{she said}} she wished he might put a curb round the well out <b>there,</b> because <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> sometimes, a body might stumble into it; and the parson, he told him he might do that.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} he sat <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> the moon through the {{skylight}} above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the stairway. He tried to be philosophical.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pratt," [...] said Crosbie, {{putting his}} hand on his friend's {{shoulder}} as soon as the party had ridden out of hearing, [...] "do you see that girl <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> blue habit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{chairman}} looked puzzled, then replied: [...] "If {{my friend}} {{will come up}} here instead of hiding down <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> I {{have no doubt that}} Dr. Therne will be able to satisfy his curiosity." ...|$|E
60|$|And so we {{sat down}} to the food around {{the light of a}} good many candles while she {{remained}} crouching out <b>there,</b> staring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> as if feeding her bad temper on the heavily scented air of the admirable garden.|$|R
6000|$|I am to lie [...] At daybreak on the {{mountain}} and keep watch [...] Until an Aran coracle puts in [...] At Muckanish or at the rocky shore [...] Under Finvarra, but would break my neck [...] If I went stumbling <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b>|$|R
60|$|KIT. Arethusa, if {{you looked}} at me like that I'd forgive you piracy on the high seas. I was only sulky; I was boxed up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black <b>dark,</b> and couldn't see my hand. It made me pity that blind man, by George.|$|R
60|$|Elsa {{stood for}} a moment quite still <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> with the silence of the night and all its sweet sounds {{encompassing}} her, and the scent of withered flowers and slowly-dying leaves mounting to her quivering nostrils.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} to-night I shan't sleep a wink," [...] she {{retorted}} crossly, [...] "once father has gone. I shall always {{be thinking of}} you out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> watching this house. It will make me nervous." ...|$|E
60|$|His cudgel crashed {{down upon}} the meddler's head: there was a groan, a dim form sank to the ground among {{the feet of the}} crowd, and the next moment it lay <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> alone. The mob pressed on, their {{enjoyment}} nothing disturbed by this episode.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{thinks that}} <b>there</b> are grouse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Valley, and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lands towards {{the setting sun}} over the Rocky Knoll." ...|$|R
60|$|Death {{had been}} so near! She had felt an icy breath across her throat! She was frightened--hideously, abjectly, miserably frightened. Death lurked for her, <b>there</b> outside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> from behind <b>the</b> acacia tree! Death <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guise of a jealous madman, whose hate had been whetted by an hour's lonely watch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark--lonely, but for his thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|But dusk {{would come}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apple boughs, [...] The {{green of the}} glow-worm shine, [...] <b>The</b> birds <b>in</b> nest would crouch to rest, [...] And home I'd trudge to mine; [...] And <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight, <b>dark</b> with dew, [...] Asking not {{wherefore}} nor why, [...] Would brood like a ghost, and as still as a post, [...] Old Nicholas Nye.|$|R
60|$|At first Bremner {{watched the}} rising tide, {{and as he}} sat up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> he felt himself dreadfully forsaken and desolate, and began to comment on things in general to his dog, by way of {{inducing}} a more sociable and cheery state of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] she gasped, [...] "old Jerome Irving and Aunt Anne {{are sitting}} round <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> {{on the front}} porch and he had his arms around her, kissing her! And they never saw nor heard me, no more'n if they were deaf and blind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{give you}} my word to-night.' And, looking thoughtfully down, she {{gradually}} moved and moved away, going into the adjoining room, and closing the door between them. She remained <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> till {{he was tired of}} waiting, and had gone up to his own chamber.|$|E
60|$|I thought I should ha' gorn out o' my mind. It {{was just}} a little tinkle at first, then another tinkle, but, as I stood <b>there</b> all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> and cold trying to make up my mind to take no notice of it, it began to ring like mad. I 'ad to go--I've known men climb over the gate afore now--and I didn't want to be caught in that dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another object {{besides the}} object I know of?" [...] {{repeated}} Captain Wragge, {{when he was}} left by himself. [...] "Is <b>there</b> a gentleman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background, after all? Is <b>there</b> mischief brewing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> that I don't bargain for?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{about this}} silent {{creature}} sitting <b>there</b> so motionless, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>there</b> seemed a warmth, a hidden fervour of feeling, {{as if the}} whole of her being had been stirred, and some change were taking place in its very depths.|$|R
60|$|Aaron stood <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> {{outside the}} big gates, and wished himself somewhere else. However, he rang the bell. There {{was a huge}} barking of dogs on the other side. Presently a light {{switched}} on, and a woman, followed by a man, appeared cautiously, in the half-opened doorway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yeh {{better come}} up an' get killed easy-like;" [...] one called {{down to the}} mucker. [...] "We're apt to muss yeh all up down <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> with these here axes and crowbars, an' then wen we send yeh home yer pore maw won't know her little boy at all." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said it was}} for a {{talk that}} I had come; and <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> room, lighted only by the street lamp without, she told me all. And at the end she dropped her head on her bare arms; and I turned away and looked out of the window for a while.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As I stood <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{gathering}} <b>dark</b> I {{thought that}} in this simple explanation I had mastered {{the problem of the}} world--mastered the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not call}} Nick," [...] was the other's swift admonition. [...] "Don't you see, Noll?" [...] he {{explained}} <b>in</b> answer to <b>the</b> inquiry of his brother's stare, [...] "don't {{you see that}} we fought <b>there</b> almost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> and without witnesses. It...." [...] he swallowed, [...] "it will be called murder, fair fight though it was; and should it be discovered that it was I...." [...] He shivered and his glance grew wild; his lips twitched.|$|R
5000|$|It {{goes on to}} {{say that}} if <b>there</b> were sweethearts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> [...] "he'd pass the light and leave it dark," [...] and concludes by {{explaining}} that now, the old lamplighter turns the stars on at night and turns them off at dawn.|$|R
6000|$|First {{he accused}} Jacobsen, {{who was very}} indignant, and then me, who laughed. In the end Jacobsen and I left the [...] "circle" [...] and the cabin, which was locked behind us; only Bastin and Bickley {{remaining}} <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b> Presently we heard sounds of altercation, and Bickley emerged looking very red in the face, followed by Bastin, who was saying: ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{told him}} what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but clear enough when done. He heard me out with very few questions, {{laughing}} here and there like a man delighted: {{and the sound of}} his laughing (above all <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> where neither one of us could see the other) was extraordinary friendly to my heart.|$|E
60|$|We stood <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> whispering, {{and then}} Bill couldn't stand it any longer, and 'e went over on tiptoe to the bunk ag'in. He was tremblin' with {{excitement}} and I wasn't much better, {{when all of}} a sudden the cook sat up in 'is bunk with a dreadful laughing scream and called out that somebody was ticklin' 'im.|$|E
60|$|Bostil strode slowly ahead. He {{sympathized with}} {{the tension that}} held Slone; he knew why the rider's face was gray, why his lips only moved mutely, why <b>there</b> was horror <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> {{strained}} eyes, why the lean, strong hands, slowly taking up the lasso, now shook like leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind.|$|R
60|$|On a short {{consideration}} with him, {{she agreed}} to wait {{at the top of}} the tower till he could come back and inform her if the accident were really so serious as to interfere with his plan for departure. He then left her, and <b>there</b> she sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> alone, looking over the parapet, and straining her eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the homestead.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Jurassic, about 200 million years ago, a sea covered almost all of south Germany. During the Lower Jurassic (Lias) the region was {{initially}} still {{on the edge of the}} sea. Rivers transported sand from the mainlandinto the sea basin and the coast moved further southeast as a result. <b>There</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> still waters <b>dark</b> clays and marls were deposited.|$|R
