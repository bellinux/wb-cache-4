500|$|Earlier, in 1689, {{after the}} Moghul armies had overrun {{the region of}} the Mysore <b>table-land,</b> twelve parganas (or sub-districts) were annexed to the newly formed {{province}} (subah) of Sira. The remaining region was allowed to remain under the rule of the poligars, who continued to collect taxes from the cultivators, but were now required to pay annual tribute to the provincial government in Sira. In the annexed regions, in which tax assessment on cultivation was under amāni or Sarkār (provincial government) management, an elaborate system of officials collected and managed revenue. Most offices had existed in the region under the previous Bijapur Sultanate administration, and consisted, among others, of Deshmūks, Deshpāndes, Majmūndārs, and Kānungoyas. The Deshmūks [...] "settled accounts" [...] with the village headmen (or patels); the Deshpāndes verified the account-books of the village registrars (or kārnāms); the Kānungoyas entered the official regulations in the village record-books and also explained decrees and regulations to the village governing officers and residents.|$|E

2500|$|Explorer James Bruce, {{who visited}} the Ethiopian Highlands c. 1770, wrote of [...] "a {{tradition}} among the Abyssinians, which {{they say they have}} had since time immemorial", that {{in the days after the}} Deluge, Cush, the son of Ham, traveled with his family up the Nile until they reached the Atbara plain, then still uninhabited, from where they could see the Ethiopian <b>table-land.</b> There they ascended and built Axum, and sometime later returned to the lowland, building Meroë. He also states that European scholars of his own day had summarily rejected this account on grounds of their established theory, that Cush must have arrived in Africa via Arabia and the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait located between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa. Further, the great obelisk of Axum was said to have been erected by Cush in order to mark his allotted territory, and his son Ityopp'is was said to have been buried there, according to the Book of Aksum, which Bruce asserts was revered throughout Abyssinia equally with the Kebra Nagast.|$|E

5000|$|The {{geography}} of Tibet {{consists of the}} high mountains, lakes and rivers lying between Central, East and South Asia.

60|$|Once more, {{this double}} {{change in the}} extent and in the {{elevation}} of the lands, involved yet another species of heterogeneity, that of coast-line. A tolerably even surface raised out of the ocean, must have a simple, regular sea-margin; but a surface varied by <b>table-lands</b> and intersected by mountain-chains must, when raised out of the ocean, have an outline extremely irregular both in its leading features and in its details. Thus endless is the accumulation of geological and geographical results slowly brought about by this one cause--the contraction of the Earth.|$|R
60|$|Without even {{awaiting}} a reply, the guide walked smartly {{into the bushes}} in rear of his lonely dwelling, followed by our hero. In a few minutes they reached a mound or hillock, which had been cleared of trees and underwood, and from the summit of which one could see over the tree-tops and the cottage roof away down the valley to the horizon of the <b>table-lands</b> beyond. It was a lovely spot, and, as Lawrence saw it that quiet sunny afternoon, was suggestive only of peace and happiness.|$|R

60|$|On {{passing the}} limits of O-push-y-e-cut's domains, the {{travellers}} left the elevated <b>table-lands,</b> and all the wild and romantic scenery which has just been described.

60|$|To many {{travellers}} {{it would}} have been death to have ventured out on such a trackless waste, but Pedro knew the road and the landmarks so thoroughly that he advanced with his wonted confidence. At first the snow was very deep, and, despite their utmost care, they once or twice strayed from the road, and were not far from destruction. As they descended, however, the intense cold abated; and when they came out upon occasional <b>table-lands,</b> they found that the snow-fall there had been much less than in the higher regions, also that it had drifted off the road so much that travelling became more easy.|$|R

60|$|By high plains I do {{not mean}} table-lands; <b>table-lands</b> do not {{interest}} one very much. They seem to involve the bore of a climb without the pleasure of a peak.

60|$|He pointed as {{he spoke}} {{to the head of the}} glen or valley, which was {{somewhat}} narrower and more gloomy than the vales through which they had ridden in the earlier part of the day. Since crossing the first cordillera on the Pacific side of the Andes they had, indeed, traversed a great variety of country. In some places the land was rocky and comparatively barren. In others, where the peculiar form of the mountains sheltered the <b>table-lands,</b> the country was fertile, and numerous farms dotted the landscape, but as they ascended higher on the main chain the farms became fewer, until they finally disappeared, and an occasional hut, with a mere patch of cultivated ground, was all that remained in the vast solitudes to tell of the presence of man.|$|R
60|$|These {{three days}} {{gave me a}} fair general view of Grand Canary.

From this plateau barrancos, or ravine-valleys, said to number 103, radiate quaquaversally. Their bottoms, {{becoming more and more}} level as they near the sea, are enriched by gushing founts, and are unrivalled for fertility, while the high and stony intervening ridges are barren as Arabia Deserta. Even sun and rain cannot fertilise the dividing walls of the rich and riant vegas. Here, as at Madeira, and showing even a better likeness, the tierra caliente is Egypt, the mediania (middle-heights) are Italy, and the upper mesetas, the cloud-compelling <b>table-lands,</b> are the bleak north of Europe plus a quasi-tropical sun.|$|R
