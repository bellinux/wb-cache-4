5|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, the town {{experienced}} severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In {{the autumn of}} 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks. The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of the borough council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007, flooding has been less severe, and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the <b>town</b> <b>car</b> parks are often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the run up to Christmas in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Model K with a {{limousine}} body type sold for $3,850 in 1909, and the <b>town</b> <b>car</b> went for $3,200.|$|E
25|$|In some cars, an {{additional}} feature was the so-called opera light that was {{mounted on the}} outside of the B-pillar or C-pillar and lit up when the exterior lights were turned on. (See 1980s Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car,</b> 1979-91 Mercury Grand Marquis, or high-end models of the 1988-1990 Oldsmobile 88).|$|E
50|$|A padded {{roof was}} {{standard}} equipment on all <b>Town</b> <b>Cars,</b> with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim <b>Town</b> <b>Cars,</b> a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with center pillar coach lamps was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier trims, a padded vinyl coach roof (covering the rear {{half of the}} roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim <b>Town</b> <b>Cars.</b> On non-Cartier <b>Town</b> <b>Cars,</b> a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating {{the look of a}} convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.|$|R

25|$|On November 22, 1920, Thomas' {{effects were}} sold off in an estate sale. The sale netted {{approximately}} $30,000. Lewis Selznick bought Thomas' <b>town</b> <b>car</b> {{for an undisclosed}} sum. Mabel Normand bought a 20-piece toilet set, a 14 karat gold cigarette case, and three pieces of jewelry, including a sapphire pin.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, he {{auctioned}} his 2001 Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> on eBay {{to raise}} money for Girls, Inc. In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation. Later auctions raised $2,110,100, $1.68million and $3,456,789. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house. The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, New York {{introduced}} {{incentives to}} replace its current yellow cabs with electric hybrid vehicles {{such as the}} Toyota Prius and Ford Escape Hybrid. In May 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a five-year plan to switch New York City's taxicabs to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles {{as part of an}} agenda for New York City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the plan was dropped after Cab companies complained that the cost of maintaining the new hybrid vehicles vastly outweighed the tiny amount of fuel savings they got from going smaller. Proponents of the traditional Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> and Ford Crown Victoria say they were well suited to their task, while others said customers who cared for the environment preferred hybrids. Not only that, but passenger safety also became an issue with the newer vehicles, and 6 months after the program took effect, it was dropped. Still, the proportion of the taxi fleet made up of Crown Victorias has dropped over time. In 2010, it stood at about 60% of yellow cabs, as the number of Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Sienna minivans kept rising. The percentage of Crown Victoria taxis in the city would be further undercut by the adoption of the similarly-sized Toyota Camry Hybrids since 2010, and the Toyota Prius V. By 2015, the Ford Victoria fleet would be nearly entirely replaced.|$|E

500|$|During {{their time}} in America, Marie, Nicholas and Ileana {{undertook}} tours of several cities, including Philadelphia. They were very popular, and were greeted with equal enthusiasm in each city they visited, {{so much so that}} [...] " [...] seemed fairly dazed by their tremendous ovation". At the White House, the official dinner was marked by awkward moments, due to the morose attitude of President Calvin Coolidge and his wife Grace; Marie lingered less than two hours. Before leaving the United States, Marie was presented with a bullet-proof armored <b>town</b> <b>car</b> by Willys-Knight, which she joyfully accepted. On 24 November, Marie and her children were seen off by a delegation from Washington, D.C., as they prepared to leave by ship from New York Harbour. Morris wrote that [...] "our last view was of Her Majesty, her children on either side, waving back with that tear-and-smile of those who pass from happy scenes." [...] Morris accompanied the queen throughout her journey and offered a very detailed account of Marie's time in America in her book, published in 1927.|$|E
500|$|... "Swim Good" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics and was widely {{considered to be}} one of the best tracks off Nostalgia Ultra. Sam Hockley-Smith of The Fader commented that [...] "Swim Good" [...] was one of the [...] "highs off of record", as did Anthony Osei of Complex magazine. Pitchfork commented that the track was a [...] "brooding highlight" [...] off the record. In addition, Yahoo! Music's Billy Jounhson described it as a [...] "breakout" [...] song". AbsolutePunk stated the song was [...] "hard-hitting" [...] and [...] "proved that Ocean's voice is as great as his knack for writing thoughtful pop songs." [...] NPR's Andrew Noz commented that [...] "in the standout [...] "Swim Good," [...] he sings of putting broken hearts in the trunk of a Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> and driving to the ocean as they bleed through." [...] Several critics noted the song for its dark subject matter. On the week of September 10, 2011 the song debuted at number eighty-one on Billboards Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and peaked at position number seventy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Town</b> <b>car</b> (US): Essentially {{the inverse}} of the landaulet, a {{historical}} body style {{in which the}} front seats were open and the rear compartment closed, normally with a removable top to cover the front chauffeur's compartment. In Europe the style {{is also known as}} Sedanca de Ville, often shortened to Sedanca or de Ville. [...] Note that the modern Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> derives its name, but nothing else, from this style.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2012, {{a version}} of <b>Car</b> <b>Town</b> for iOS, called <b>Car</b> <b>Town</b> Streets, was released. The game's {{graphics}} are {{similar to that of}} <b>Car</b> <b>Town,</b> but its gameplay is much different. In 2014, an Android OS port came out on the Google Play Storereleased by Miniclip. On December 23rd, 2015, <b>Car</b> <b>Town</b> Streets closed down.|$|R
50|$|The Aygo {{was used}} on BBC's Top Gear {{in a giant}} match of football, {{showcasing}} its maneuverability. The Top Gear presenters deemed the Aygo and its Peugeot and Citroën counterparts to be competent <b>town</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{also the}} FM <b>Towns</b> <b>Car</b> Marty (Efu Emu Taunzu Kā Mātī) for {{installation}} in automobiles. It included a built in navigation system with audio and video guidance, and could also be detached from the car and played at home. It came in two versions, the MVP-1 (released in April 1994) and MVP-10 (released in November 1994). The only difference between the MVP-1 and MVP-10 is the drive mechanisms. There has been speculation that the MVP-10 was introduced since the MVP-1 broke easily. An optional IC Card for the FM <b>Towns</b> <b>Car</b> Marty allowed it to use VICS, and was subsequently sold with a video monitor.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{known as}} {{full-size}} luxury cars, grand saloons, or premium large cars, while [...] "Oberklasse" [...] {{is used in}} Germany. Typically a four-door saloon (sedan). These are the most powerful saloons, with six, eight and twelve-cylinder engines and have more equipment than smaller models. Vehicles in this category include some of the models from the flagship lines of luxury car brands, such as Cadillac CT6, Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> and Maserati Quattroporte.|$|E
2500|$|GM's timing {{with this}} latest {{downsizing}} {{proved to be}} off the mark. Gasoline prices had dropped dramatically — below $1.00 per gallon {{in many parts of}} the U.S. — by the fall of 1985, against corporate soothsayers' predictions of $3.00 and up. As a result, buyers chose to [...] "buy big" [...] in 1986, with cars like the Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> and Chrysler's long-in-the-tooth, V8-powered Fifth Avenue setting sales records for the 1986 model year.|$|E
2500|$|The 1940 Roadmaster had {{a shorter}} wheelbase, was lighter, and was less {{expensive}} than the previous year’s model. The formal and fastback sedans were gone, {{but for the first}} time a 2-door coupe was available, which sold a respectable 3,991 units. [...] Also new for this year, the coach-building firm of Brunn was asked to design several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80 and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have actually been produced in 1940, an open-front <b>town</b> <b>car</b> not surprisingly called the Townmaster. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345.|$|E
5000|$|The Ross was a [...] "Brass era" [...] {{gasoline}} automobile {{manufactured in}} Detroit, Michigan from 1915 to 1918. It had a Herschell-Spillman V-8 engine with body styles including sedans and <b>town</b> <b>cars.</b> The vehicles are now considered antiques.|$|R

2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant to get a look at the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the passenger window, Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The TLC oversees over 90,000 for-hire vehicles, {{including}} [...] "black cars"; [...] "livery cars"; commuter [...] "dollar vans"; luxury limousines; and paratransit vehicles. Black cars {{cannot be}} hailed on the street, instead being dispatched by a parent business. These businesses usually use luxury cars {{such as a}} Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> due to their almost-exclusively business clientele, and drivers ordinarily get less than 10% of their income in cash. There were around 500 base stations for black cars, comprising a total fleet of 25,000 vehicles, as of the 2014 TLC Factbook. Livery cars are similar to black cars, but are used by a greater range of people. There were 80 livery bases and 10,000 livery vehicles in 2014. Commuter vans carry more people, usually between 9 and 20 passengers per trip. Commuter van licenses were held by 50 entities, which collectively owned 500 vehicles, in 2014. Luxury limousine providers and private paratransit companies numbered 200 each in 2014, collectively chartering 7,000 luxury limousine vehicles and 2,000 paratransit vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Aluminium engine cradles and {{suspension}} struts for stretched Lincoln <b>Town</b> <b>Car</b> {{were the}} first automotive parts that were friction stir at Tower Automotive, who use the process also for the engine tunnel of the Ford GT. A spin-off of this company is called Friction Stir Link, Inc. and successfully exploits the FSW process, e.g. for the flatbed trailer [...] "Revolution" [...] of Fontaine Trailers. In Japan FSW is applied to suspension struts at Showa Denko and for joining of aluminium sheets to galvanized steel brackets for the boot (trunk) lid of the Mazda MX-5. Friction stir spot welding is successfully used for the bonnet (hood) and rear doors of the Mazda RX-8 and the boot lid of the Toyota Prius. Wheels are friction stir welded at Simmons Wheels, UT Alloy Works and Fundo. Rear seats for the Volvo V70 are friction stir welded at Sapa, HVAC pistons at Halla Climate Control and exhaust gas recirculation coolers at Pierburg. Tailor welded blanks are friction stir welded for the Audi R8 at Riftec. The B-column of the Audi R8 Spider is friction stir welded from two extrusions at Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria.|$|E
