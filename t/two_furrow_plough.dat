The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the furrow opener mechanisms action and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism in no-till, on the Oxisol resistance to penetration during soybean sowing, under three soil moistures. The experiment was arranged in split-split plot design, in which the plots were composed by three soil moistures (23. 8; 25. 5 and 27. 5 % b. s.), <b>two</b> <b>furrow</b> opener mechanisms sub-plots (double disks and <b>furrow</b> <b>plough)</b> and the split-split plot of three levels of load applied to soil firming mechanism (12. 2; 18. 5 and 24. 1 kPa), according to randomized blocks design, with three replications. The soil moisture provided different resistance behavior to penetration with the depth, on the seedbed, independently of the furrow opener and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism. The <b>furrow</b> <b>plough</b> use provided less soil resistance to penetration when compared to the double disk furrow opener, on the seedbed, independently of the soil moisture and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism.

40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) and the International Crops Re search Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have {{developed}} a <b>furrowing</b> <b>plough</b> which enables better use {{to be made of}} the vertisols found in the upland plains of Ethiopia. These fertile soils are too hard to be worked during the dry season and are quickly waterlogged during the rainy season which considerably reduces their productivity. According to trials carried out in 1986, such ploughing reduces the waterlogging of the rooting zone and produces higher yields. It can be done without a large investment by a <b>furrowing</b> <b>plough</b> made from <b>two</b> traditional ploughs attached together by a wood frame and pulled by a pair of oxen.

Other features include the uncommon site of dry stone walling (not a common local feature) and specimen trees and earthworks which suggest 18th century landscaping. Capability Brown is known to have visited Eywood House in the valley below in Titley and though no evidence of any work being done by him exists the substantial evidence of landscaping suggests that great wealth and imagination was used to greatly alter the hill and surrounding area and would benefit from some modern archaeological investigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{earthworks}} {{are located}} {{a little to}} the north west of the present village of Spurstow, which is believed to have subsequently contracted or moved. They lie in a valley, which formerly contained a stream. There are six house platforms which are 25-40 metres2 in area, each of which is surrounded by a 2-metre ditch. To {{the north side of the}} platforms and abutting them there is evidence of medieval ridge and <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> A later causeway runs north-south, bisecting the site.

25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow plough in clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} <b>furrow.</b> For <b>ploughs</b> with <b>two</b> or more <b>furrows</b> more than <b>two</b> horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sodâ and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down.
