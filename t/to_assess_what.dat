Ubisoft Reflections was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and game mechanics for authenticity and references to real life hacktivism were fictionalized, like the Project Chanology protest. The original soundtrack for Watch Dogs 2 was composed by Hudson Mohawke.|$|E

25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what</b> type of diving exposure suit is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the right size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of diving suits.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what</b> current {{knowledge}} of social immune systems suggested about whether social immunity was a bypoduct or driver of complex group living, Meunier delineated 30 different mechanisms of social immunity found in eusocial insects {{and looked for}} counterparts to these in presocial and solitary insects. Supporting the hypothesis that social immunity was a driver and not a by-product of complex group living, 10 mechanisms had counterparts in presocial insects and 4 in solitary species (though this {{does not imply that}} some mechanisms may evolve as a byproduct). Evidence that social immunity mechanisms are selected for at least somewhat due to collective benefits is lacking though – possibly due to the difficulty in isolating the immune benefits from the other benefits that social immunity mechanisms often bestow (e.g. allogrooming inhibits the establishment of ectoparasites, but also improves the accuracy of nest mate recognition due to the sharing and thus homogenization of chemical signatures between group members), and the difficulty in experimentally separating direct fitness from indirect fitness, potentiated in eusocial taxa where sterile/non-reproductive individuals predominatee. More studies on presocial taxa would allow for phyletic analyses to recover the actual path of evolution that different mechanisms of social immunity took.|$|E

Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as [...] "Restricted" [...] or [...] "Prohibited", but a new designation is being considered [...] "Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis", to allow scientists <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what</b> damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment. A nonproft organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: [...] "altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives"; and Category II: [...] "increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I". More than 100 species have been placed in Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.|$|E

2500|$|Other historians, such {{as those}} who collaborated on 'Paekche of Korea and the Origin of Yamato Japan' and Jonathan W. Best, who helped {{translate}} {{what was left of}} the Baekje annals, have noted that these princes set up schools in Yamato Japan and took control of the Japanese naval forces during the war with Goguryeo, taking this as evidence of them being more along the lines of diplomats with some kind of familial tie to the Japanese imperial family and as evidence against any hostage status. In addition, the translation of the old documents is difficult because in the past, the term [...] "Wa" [...] was derogatory, meaning [...] "midget" [...] or [...] "dwarf," [...] which was a reference to the perceived smaller stature of the average Japanese in ancient times. As a result, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what</b> is truly being stated, particularly in records made in Korea after the fall of Baekje, as the reference to Yamato Wa (Japan) could have been a derogatory statement by a rival nation (specifically Silla).|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{development}} {{of the principles of}} natural justice began with the case of Ridge v. Baldwin (1963) in which Lord Reid rejected the artificial distinction established in a line of cases which held that a court could only judicially review decisions that were judicial or quasi-judicial in nature, but not those that were [...] "administrative". Instead, he held that the role of the courts was <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what</b> a reasonable person would regard as fair procedure in any given circumstances. Following this case, the {{development of}} natural justice principles led to a [...] "sliding scale of fairness", with the degree of fairness required varying with the context and circumstances of each case. In Lloyd v. McMahon (1987), Lord Bridge of Harwich outlined some considerations to take into account, including the character of the decision-making body, the kind of decision it has to make, and the statutory or other framework in which it operates. Most importantly, it has to be considered whether the fundamental human rights of an individual will be affected. Where such rights are affected, the common law will require more procedural protection.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the history}} records in Japan (Nihon Shoki) and Korea (Samguk Sagi), Korean princes were sent to Japan as hostages. Due to the {{confusion}} on {{the exact nature of}} this relationship of whether Japanese is the founder of Silla or hostages {{and the fact that the}} Nihon Shoki is a compilation of myths make it difficult to evaluate. In Japan the hostage interpretation is dominant. Other historians like the ones who collaborated in the works for [...] "Paekche of Korea and the origin of Yamato Japan" [...] and Jonathan W. Best who helped translate what was left of the Baekjae annals have noted Silla King served as horse keeper for the Japanese Emperor and were the vanguard of the Japanese Navy during the war with Koguryeo as evidence of them being diplomats with some kind of familial tie to the Japanese imperial family and not hostages. In addition, the translation of these documents are difficult because in the past the term [...] "Wa" [...] was derogatory meaning [...] "midget pirate" [...] or [...] "dwarf pirate" [...] in Chinese.

2500|$|Until {{recently}} {{babies born}} in hospitals {{were removed from}} their mothers shortly after birth and brought to the mother only at feeding times. [...] Mothers were told that their newborn would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mother more time to rest. [...] As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a [...] "rooming in" [...] option wherein {{after a period of}} routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother's room. [...] However, more recent information has begun to question the standard practice of removing the newborn immediately postpartum for routine postnatal procedures before being returned to the mother. [...] Beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) may benefit both mother and infant. [...] Using animal studies that have shown that [...] the intimate contact inherent [...] in skin-to-skin contact promotes neurobehaviors that result in the fulfillment of basic biological needs as a model, recent studies have been done <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>what,</b> if any, advantages may be associated with early skin-to-skin contact for human mothers and their babies.
