5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe.

25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large temperature sensitivity) and when they were temperature cycled <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> return to different frequencies (they were hysteretic).|$|R
50|$|Labor {{shortages}} in the German war economy became critical especially after German {{defeat in the}} battle of Stalingrad in 1942-1943. This led to the increased use of prisoners as forced labourers in German industries. Following the German invasion and occupation of Polish territory, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens, including teenagers, became labourers in Germany, few by choice. A total of 2.3 million Polish citizens, including 300,000 POWs, were deported to Germany as forced laborers. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work longer hours for lower wages than their German counterparts.|$|R

They accept the Bible as Divine and the Biblical history of the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah to Moses at Mount Sinai as true, and have been widely regarded as Orthodox. Nonetheless, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some input from modern academic scholarship and <b>tended</b> not <b>to</b> treat Rabbinical Midrash and Aggadah as fact.|$|R
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
50|$|These decentralizing trends, however, did {{not have}} equal effects on African-American {{residents}} of the city. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> far less access to New Deal mortgage support programs such as Federal Housing Authority and Veterans Administration insured mortgages. African-American neighborhoods were viewed by lenders and the federal programs as riskier, resulting - in this period - in much lower rates of home ownership for African-Americans than other residents of the city.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1880s, the Socialists {{knew their}} first electoral success, winning control of some municipalities. Jean Allemane and some FTSF members criticized {{the focus on}} electoral goals. In 1890, they created the Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (POSR). Their main {{objective}} was to win power through the tactic of the [...] "general strike". Besides these groups, some politicians declared themselves as independent socialists outside of the political parties. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> moderate opinions.|$|R
5000|$|The Terry Alts {{were one}} of many clandestine {{societies}} founded in Ireland from the 18th century on, all involved in agrarian agitation in pre-Famine Ireland. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> colourful names such as the [...] "Whiteboys", [...] "Oakboys", [...] "Rockites", and [...] "Ribbonmen". These agrarian societies all had their own characteristics and specific origins, relating to fair rents, traditional access to common land or payment of tithes to the established church and other similar issues.|$|R
5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more mixed populations.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme {{example of this is}} the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E

By the time most indentured workers had earned freedom and some rose to common planter status, the wealthiest planter families in the county already controlled the valuable riverfront property.

25|$|These {{alterations}} which {{protect against}} malarial infections but impair {{red blood cells}} are generally considered blood disorders, since <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> overt and detrimental effects.

Some of these disorders are known by fanciful and cryptic names like sickle-cell anemia, thalassaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen and the Duffy antigen. These names refer to various proteins, enzymes, and the shape or function of red blood cells.|$|E
