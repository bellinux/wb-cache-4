However, he never again attained {{the high level}} of his remarkable papers of 1874–84, even after Kronecker's death on December 29, 1891. He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals.

5|$|Having {{completed}} those chapters which analyse {{the relevant}} aspects {{of power in}} social life, Russell shifts his focus onto <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> issues that are connected with those problems.

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in <b>the</b> <b>Philosophical</b> Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, {{universities}} were opened to women, allowing Rand {{to be in}} the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University.

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E

5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, <b>the</b> <b>philosophical</b> consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In 1767 Pennant {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} the Royal Society. About this time he met the much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire.

Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.|$|E
