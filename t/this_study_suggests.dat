25|$|In {{artificial}} selection studies, specific strains of rats were bred to prefer alcohol. These rats preferred drinking alcohol over other liquids, {{resulting in a}} tolerance for alcohol and exhibited a physical dependency on alcohol. Rats that were not bred for this preference did not have these traits. Upon analyzing the brains of these two strains of rats, {{it was discovered that}} there were differences in chemical composition of certain areas of the brain. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> that certain brain mechanisms are more genetically prone to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain {{as central to}} their experience, sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.|$|E
25|$|Parrots have {{fluorescent}} plumage {{that may}} be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulates) found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> that the fluorescent plumage of parrots is not simply a by-product of pigmentation, but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.|$|E

25|$|Other {{eutrophication}} studies {{performed in}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008). To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes {{to look at}} the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{that is made}} naturally {{by human}} cells. It can also be administered in capsules or {{can be found in}} foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has {{an important role in the}} Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve conduction velocity. Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{attention}} has been negative. In his book, Otaku, Hiroki Azuma observed: [...] "Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan", citing the fact that [...] "n 2003, Hayao Miyazaki won the Academy Award for his Spirited Away; {{around the same time}} Takashi Murakami achieved recognition for otaku-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the 2004 International Architecture exhibition of the Venice Biennale (Biennale Architecture) featured “otaku”. In 2005, the word moe - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen {{as one of the top}} ten [...] “buzzwords of the year." [...] The former Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso has also claimed to be an otaku, using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs. In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of otaku. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{a journal}} article {{published}} in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reported a gender bias among science faculty. [...] Faculty were asked to review a resume from a hypothetical student and report how likely they would be to hire or mentor that student, {{as well as what}} they would offer as starting salary. [...] Two resumes were distributed randomly to the faculty, only differing in the names {{at the top of the}} resume (John or Jennifer). [...] The male student was rated as significantly more competent, more likely to be hired, and more likely to be mentored. [...] The median starting salary offered to the male student was greater than $3,000 over the starting salary offered to the female student. [...] Both male and female faculty exhibited this gender bias. [...] <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> bias may partly explain the persistent deficit in the number of women at the highest levels of scientific fields. [...] Another study reported that men are favored in some domains, such as biology tenure rates, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair; the authors interpreted this to suggest that the under-representation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration. In April 2015 Williams and Ceci published a set of five national experiments showing that hypothetical female applicants were favored by faculty for assistant professorships over identically-qualified men by a ratio of 2 to 1.|$|E
