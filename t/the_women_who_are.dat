5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was found that women who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E

She has said of teaching at a community college, [...] "I feel like I can make a greater difference in their lives. I just love that population. It just feels really comfortable to me. I love <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> coming back to school and getting their degrees, because they're so focused." ...|$|E
500|$|In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon {{addressed}} the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted {{what she knew}} and felt at the time. Bannon has said she knows the concerns of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> uncomfortable with the themes of her books: [...] "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative {{and some of it}} looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited when I was writing them." ...|$|E

500|$|Raël has {{instructed}} {{some women}} members {{to play a}} pro-sex feminist role in the Raëlian Church. [...] "Rael's Girls" [...] is another group {{of women in the}} movement which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women. [...] Rael's Girls solely consists of women who work in the sex industry. [...] The women of Rael's Girls say {{there is no reason to}} repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute. [...] This organization was set up [...] "to support the choice of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> working in the sex industry". Rael's Girls and its founder Raël were featured in a pictorial in the October 2004 issue of Playboy.|$|E
500|$|In her {{piece for}} Salon, Janet Turley {{claimed that the}} women [...] "become {{reflections}} of the men", given that the True Detective universe is seen {{through the eyes of}} the show's male leads. Sam Adams of Indiewire contended that the season's central story focused on [...] "the horrible things men do to women", many of which are never reported to or investigated by authorities. Adams wrote, [...] "No one missed Dora Lange. Marie Fontenot disappeared, and the police let a rumor stop them from following up". Furthermore, he observed that the role of women is only more profound because Cohle is made to suffer by virtue of his ex-wife and deceased daughter, and Hart is unable to [...] "deal appropriately with <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> there". According to Scott Wilson, a cultural studies lecturer at Kingston University, women are distinguished into three groups—what he calls [...] "the superegoic, the obscene and the sacred". Maggie, in Wilson's interpretation, is portrayed as the superegoic wife who [...] "constantly makes demands on her guilty husband or partner tying him or her down and deflecting him or her from his symbolic role as police." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis and Stone asked William Elder, {{a retired}} Philadelphia physician, {{to draw up}} the {{convention}} call while they set about securing signatures to it and lining up speakers. [...] "We need all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> accustomed to speak in public – every stick of timber that is sound," [...] Stone wrote to Antoinette Brown, a fellow Oberlin student who was preparing for the ministry. On Davis's list to contact was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who sent her regrets along with a letter of support and a speech to be read in her name. Stanton wished {{to stay at home}} because she would be in the late stages of pregnancy.|$|E

The narrative makes it clear it is the crushing pressure of Korean etiquette which murders them. Han Kang is well served by Deborah Smith's subtle translation in this disturbing book." [...] Porochista Khakpour, writing for The New York Times, states that the book is nothing like typical stories about vegetarianism that end with [...] "enlightenment". She compares the work with African-Australian author Ceridwen Dovey's novella Blood Kin, American author Herman Melville's 1853 short story [...] "Bartleby, the Scrivener", Iranian author Sadegh Hedayat's 1937 cult horror story The Blind Owl, and various journals and works of Austrian author Franz Kafka, including A Hunger Artist.|$|E

6000|$|Finlayson, after {{minutely}} {{describing the}} people of Cochin China, says that their rounded heads and faces are their chief characteristics; and, he adds, “the roundness of the whole countenance is more striking in <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> reckoned beautiful in proportion as they display this form of face.” The Siamese have small noses with divergent nostrils, a wide mouth, rather thick lips, a remarkably large face, with very high and broad cheek-bones. It is, therefore, not wonderful that “beauty, according to our notion is a stranger to them. Yet they consider their own females {{to be much more}} beautiful than those of Europe.”[429] ...|$|E

For example, I have not time to write a book explaining to every one how nice Frank Crosse is; but if he were nasty my life would be empty, and so of course I should write my book.' ...|$|E
