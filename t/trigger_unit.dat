2500|$|The {{fire and}} safety {{selector}} is ambidextrous and has controls {{on both sides}} of the receiver which took upon the design of the original G3 selector. Selector settings are described with letters: [...] "S"—safe ("Sicher"), [...] "E"—semi-automatic fire ("Einzelfeuer") and [...] "F"—continuous fire ("Feuerstoß"). HK also offers several other trigger options, including the so-called Navy trigger group, with settings analogous to the standard trigger, but the selector positions have been illustrated with pictograms. A semi-automatic only <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> (lacks the [...] "F" [...] setting) is also available.|$|E
2500|$|The pinned and riveted {{sheet metal}} {{receiver}} of the Bizon {{is derived from}} the AKS-74 and has been modified at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms of the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|E

5000|$|MCEM-2 is blowback-operated, {{selective}} fired weapon which fires {{from an open}} bolt. The bolt is of the [...] "telescoped", or [...] "wrap-around" [...] type, {{with most}} of its mass being {{in front of the}} breech face. The receiver is made from steel tube, and pistol grip with <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> is attached below. The magazine is inserted into the pistol grip - a feature copied from Mors.

50|$|During the {{lifetime}} of the SDS-V, Simmons also produced a compact <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> {{about the size of}} a suitcase, containing seven small pads.

50|$|The {{detection}} {{signal from}} the neutron detector {{is connected to the}} scaler unit, gated delay unit, <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> and the oscilloscope. The scaler unit is merely used to count the number of incoming particles or events. It does so by incrementing its tally of particles every time it detects a surge in the detector {{signal from the}} zero-point. There is very little dead time in this unit, implying that no matter how fast particles are coming in, it is very unlikely for this unit to fail to count an event (e.g. incoming particle). The low dead time is due to sophisticated electronics in this unit, which take little time to recover from the relatively easy task of registering a logical high every time an event occurs. The <b>trigger</b> <b>unit</b> coordinates all the electronics of the system and gives a logical high to these units when the whole setup is ready to record an event run.|$|E

40|$|A single-fibre {{electromyography}} {{measuring unit}} {{based upon a}} personal computer (Apple II) and a special <b>triggering</b> <b>unit</b> is described. Its compact size facilitates its use online, next to the patient. It is a relatively cheap system, and can be handled by one investigator and a nurse. Operation is simple, and error messages are provided. Investigation of a patient consists of measuring the time of occurrence of action potentials in up to 20 trains of complex motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). One train may consist of up to 170 MUAPs, each comprising a maximum of four single action potentials (spikes). Triggering is performed with a special unit: after an initial spike, triggering at an adjustable level is only possible within an adjustable time window. This feature reduces false triggerings and allows selection of {{a part of a}} complex MUAP. Interval analysis by the computer also reduces processing of MUAPs originating from other motor units. Computed are the mean consecutive difference (MCD) values of the jitter, the variance, the percentage of blockings and the number of relevant intervals. Scatter plots can be displayed and printed of the raw data, the consecutive differences or the interpulse intervals (IPI) against the interdischarge intervals (IDI). Suspicious data may be rejected by manipulation of graphical cursors. If a MUAP consists of at least four spikes, a test can be carried out whether there is a neurogenic variability cause: concomitant jitter. The system has been evaluated {{over the last two years}} in the EMG department of the Academic Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

The second variant is the Mk 1L, with the same features as the Mk 1S, but with a 140 mm long cylinder to fit special-purpose grenades such as tear gas canisters and less-lethal impact rounds that are too long to fit in the other models' shorter cylinder.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multi-core}} designs, distributed embedded logic an-alyzers {{with multiple}} <b>trigger</b> <b>units</b> and trace buffers with real-time offload capability through high-speed trace ports {{can be placed}} on-chip. This brings new challenges on how to connect the debug units together in such way that the limited storage space in the trace buffers can be used efficiently. This problem is further ag-gravated when shadow registers are used to capture data for some signals in the design. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that can dynamically allocate the trace buffers at runtime based on the needs for debug data acquisition coming from multiple data sources and user-programmable priorities. Experimental results show that using the proposed architecture, real-time observability can be improved using {{only a small amount}} of on-chip logic hard-ware, while avoiding excessive storage on-chip.

The rifle has a Picatinny rail for mounting optics. The rifle also features an improved muzzle brake over the SSG 04, with the ability to attach a suppressor. Introduced in 2008, Steyr claims EKO Cobra, Austrias primary counter-terrorism unit, had its hand in developing this weapon. The SSG 08 utilises the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action, cold hammer-forged barrels, <b>trigger</b> <b>units</b> and magazines of its parent, the SSG 04, but features an aluminium alloy stock, with side-folding, fully adjustable butt and additional Picatinny rails on the forend.

50|$|In {{computer}} architecture, a transport triggered architecture (TTA) {{is a kind}} of CPU {{design in}} which programs directly control the internal transport buses of a processor. Computation happens as a side effect of data transports: writing data into a triggering port of a functional <b>unit</b> <b>triggers</b> the functional <b>unit</b> to start a computation.

Due to its modular structure, TTA is an ideal processor template for application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.|$|R
