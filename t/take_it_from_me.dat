H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E

How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?' You have to have that experience to know. 'Cause you have all those things, I've had all those things, and I've had nothing but chaos around me. So I'm just sharing what I know with the world.

Writing to Charles I, Wentworth described Ormonde as [...] "young, but <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> a very staid head".|$|E
60|$|I {{took up the}} pen {{without another}} word. When I had {{finished}} the note he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> and read <b>it</b> through. Then {{he glanced at the}} address and started.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was also}} accused of ripping off the Power Station sound {{for his own}} records. He snapped: [...] "Listen, I gave The Power Station that sound. They <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> {{not the other way}} around." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another spirit, a female, said to Dante, [...] "Ah! when thou returnest to earth, and shalt have rested from thy long journey, {{remember}} me,--Pia.

2500|$|In April 1897, {{thousands}} of people reported seeing [...] "airships" [...] {{in various parts of}} the United States. Many signed affidavits.

2500|$|Vera Michelena (June 16, 1885 – August 28, 1961) was a Venezuelan American actress, contralto prima donna [...] and dancer who {{appeared}} in light opera, musical comedy, vaudeville and silent film.

6000|$|... "Don't you fret, my dear, {{about the}} letter," [...] said the voice. [...] "I {{gave it to}} the lad quite safe, and the lad he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> without a word. He went his way and I went mine, and not a living soul {{followed}} me afterwards--that I'll warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is the King's money," [...] he said curtly; [...] "you {{could never}} have <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> by force, but I give it over to you willingly now.

60|$|I {{looked over}} the paper, for I really {{did not know what}} he meant, but he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> and pointed out a {{paragraph}} about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up.|$|R
2500|$|During the war, Winston Churchill {{consulted}} {{him only}} once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of Éamon de Valera's Ireland. Baldwin saw {{the draft of}} Churchill's speech and advised against it, which advice Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, [...] "I went into Downing Street... a happy man. Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite out of things. But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country {{at such a time}} should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him". To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: [...] "You can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn't turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies {{in the eyes of the}} world. I pray he is spared to see us through".|$|E

60|$|The thick beechen stick {{had been}} feeling uncomfortably heavy in my invalid hand {{for some time}} past. There was no sort of need for my keeping it any longer. John Jago was going away to Narrabee, and Silas Meadowcroft's savage temper was subdued to a sulky repose. I handed the stick back to Ambrose. He laughed as he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} gone back to New Orleans," [...] she said, [...] "to get the {{miniature}} <b>from</b> Auguste. He <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> Monsieur." [...] She raised her head a little proudly. [...] "If my brother had asked it, I might have given it to him, though I treasured it. But Auguste is so--impulsive. My uncle told my father, who is very angry. He will punish Auguste severely, and--I do not like to have him punished. Oh, I wish I had the miniature." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{put my hand}} on hers. [...] "Don't quit, Nan. You'll {{never forgive}} {{yourself}} if you quit. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> Whit will pull out of this hole!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd {{have gone}} into the forest and got food for myself," [...] Hare-Lip announced; [...] "and if any man tried to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> away <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> I'd have killed him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said that}} she thought you would <b>take</b> <b>it</b> better <b>from</b> <b>me</b> than <b>from</b> her; and after we had made up our minds about it, she said I ought not to wait a second." ...|$|R
2500|$|With Palmer bailing on the tour, {{some critics}} {{referred}} to it as [...] "unprofessional behaviour". In Number One magazine, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: [...] "Firstly, I didn't need the money, and secondly the cash wasn't exactly a long time coming. It wasn't exactly an experience that set me up for retirement." [...] He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: [...] "Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> not the other way around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact he is. He's an American. He'll pay you that without a murmur. You can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> that it's a {{perfectly}} genuine proposition." ...|$|E

60|$|At ten, {{they put}} off; only one boat putting {{off at a}} time; another {{following}} in five minutes; both then lying on their oars until another followed. Ahead of all, paddling his own outlandish little canoe without a sound, went the Sambo pilot, to take them safely outside the reef. No light was shown but once, {{and that was in}} the commanding officer's own hand. I lighted the dark lantern for him, and he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> when he embarked. They had blue lights and such like with them, but kept themselves as dark as Murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you will}} not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> amiss <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> my dear, if I do not offer {{to be one of}} your husband's seconds in the affair?" [...] he asked suddenly, {{throwing}} off his hesitation and speaking more frankly.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{was a new}} {{revelation to}} me, and it altered my opinion of course. But I still failed to see what Mrs. Gallilee's extravagances {{had to do with}} her wicked {{resolution}} to prevent Ovid <b>from</b> marrying <b>me.</b> Miss Minerva's only answer to this was to tell me to write to Mr. Mool, while I had the chance, and ask for a copy of my father's Will. 'I will take the letter to him,' she said, 'and bring the reply myself. It will save time, if it does nothing else.' The letter was written in a minute.

60|$|RIDGEON. That doesnt matter. She coaxed {{me to see}} you. Well, {{you must}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> now that with all the good will in the world, I cannot {{undertake}} another case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I don't {{know what}} God looks like, but <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> I've seen a tintype of the devil," [...] Mary gurgled, emotionally {{fluttering}} {{back and forth}} between laughter and tears.|$|E
60|$|Thank God you did. You can't grudge me the {{happiness}} you gave me. You can't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> away <b>from</b> <b>me</b> now. I know you love me. I hold {{the sun and}} the moon in my hands and all the stars of heaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "All through life, {{it seems}} by me," [...] she continued, [...] "to tell me something. For poor {{neglected}} children, my little child pleads {{as if it}} were alive, and had a voice I knew, with which to speak to me.
