5|$|The back of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> {{iridescent}} and blue-green in color, {{with many}} yellow and gold spots. The belly is white. The head color changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season. Specimens have {{a tone of}} blue under their eyes. Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia, and {{the margin of the}} anal fin is a purplish-blue color.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Jaws {{is limited by}} how the humans respond to the shark menace. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> given much detail, with {{descriptions}} of its anatomy and presence creating the sense of an unstoppable threat. Elevating the menace are violent descriptions of the shark attacks. Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E
50|$|Cironka (Циронка) is a {{traditional}} Macedonian dish. It originates from Prespa region. This dish is made from common bleak. <b>The</b> fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> salted {{with a lot of}} salt until they become whitish. Then, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> left in a bowl for six to seven days. The bowl must be covered and except <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> we can put some nettle. After that, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> threaded and they're left to dry on sunny weather, until they get hard. Then <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> fried on both sides, and placed in hot water to become less salty. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> served with some peppermint, oil, vinegar and garlic.|$|R
50|$|Recently, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} underground from limestone caves containing streams, near Tena, Napo Province, Ecuador. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> {{observed and}} filmed climbing the cave wall reaching up to 10 ft {{above the water}} level.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} slender shape, <b>the</b> young <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> often not {{recognised}} as bream, {{but they can}} be identified by their flat bodies and silvery colour. At this stage, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> still pelagic, but after a few months, they acquire their typical body shape and become bottom-dwellers. By three to four years old, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> sexually mature.|$|R
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
40|$|The dynamites (sticks) {{used for}} <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> those {{employed}} in the quarries for blasting <b>the</b> rocks. Dynamite <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> carried out stealthly due to the economical gains. One of the serious hazards of <b>the</b> dynamite <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> physcial injury it may cause to the fishermen. <b>The</b> dynamite <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a socio-economic problem. The fishermen who resort to <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> {{well aware of the}} dangers involved. But they opt for <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> due to <b>the</b> eocnomic gains and as {{it is one of the}} ways to make easy moneyThe possible solution to the problem is to persuade the fishermen to desist from using <b>the</b> dynamites for <b>fishing</b> and offering alternate employment...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we maintain," [...] said Mary, [...] "that <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> not bailed to Henry at all. Rollo {{only gave}} him back the dipper, and, though <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> in it, still <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> {{did not do}} Henry any good, {{and so it was}} not for his benefit." ...|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{hung over}} <b>the</b> fire, {{the top of}} the barrel is covered with a lid and sealed around the edges with wet jute sacks (the water {{prevents}} the jute sacks from catching fire). All of this serves to create a very hot, humid and smoky fire. The intense heat and thick smoke <b>is</b> essential if <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> to be cooked, not burned, and to have the strong, smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies. Typically {{in less than an hour}} of smoking, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> ready to eat.|$|R
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana and the Kathasaritsagara continue, that on {{advice of}} Shiva, Rati assumes {{the form of}} Sambara's kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband's arrival in Sambara's house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his wife Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is {{swallowed}} by a fish. This fish is caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara's kitchen. When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama and she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate love of a wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada {{and that he was}} not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvārakā, Krishna's capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> <b>is</b> either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E

50|$|Cod, Mackerel, Pollack, Herring, Haddock, Halibut, Lobster, and Tuna were {{plentiful}} in {{the early}} years. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> salted and dried to preserve them as there <b>was</b> no refrigeration. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> sold in Halifax and made its way {{up and down the}} East Coast.|$|R
50|$|The Māori of New Zealand, to whom <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{known by}} their name kahawai, koopuuhuri, and kooukauka, fish in {{subsistence}} and customary capacities. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> (and are) caught with lines of flax fibre and elaborate hooks of bone, wood, shell such as paua, or stone. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> filleted before being hung on racks to dry. Recreational fishers also seek Australian salmon for their renowned mettle when hooked; <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{a challenge to}} land and often jump, occasionally standing on their tails. A significant number are taken for sport. No records of total recreational catches are kept, but the year's estimated catch of Australian herring from Western Australia's Blackwood River estuary beginning May, 1974, was 68,000 individuals.|$|R
50|$|The islands economy {{also saw}} a huge growth in its <b>fishing</b> industry. <b>The</b> <b>fishing</b> {{technique}} of almadraba {{was used in the}} seas around the island. This used a labyrinth of nets and around fifty boats which channelled huge schools of <b>fish,</b> Tuna being <b>the</b> main catch, in to a holding area. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> then culled and dragged aboard <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> boats. However these catches were so bountiful that not all <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> killed. Some of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> kept alive in aquatic enclosures. There was just this sort of Roman facility, along with a fish processing plant, built at S'Argamassa.|$|R
25|$|Wet fish {{trawlers}} – are trawlers where <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> kept in {{the hold}} in a fresh/wet condition. They must operate in areas not far distant from their landing place, and the fishing time of such vessels is limited.|$|E
25|$|In the , the roe of {{this species}} is called buriko. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> caught during its {{spawning}} season, when many of the females are loaded with eggs 23mm in diameter. The eggs are surrounded by slimy mucous.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{has been}} a staple food source since at least 3000 BC. <b>The</b> <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> served {{numerous}} ways, and many regional recipes are used: eaten raw, fermented, pickled, or cured by other techniques, such as being smoked as kippers.|$|E
30|$|The {{fingerlings}} {{were acquired}} from a hatchery in Italy and <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> under acclimatization for 8  weeks previously {{to the beginning}} of the trial.
