30|$|Social {{interactions}} {{within a}} group of participants can form a community if they occur more frequently within the group than {{with other members of}} the network.

40|$|Abstract Background Computerized {{morbidity}} registration networks {{might serve}} as early warning systems in a time where natural epidemics such as the H 1 N 1 flu can easily spread from one region to another. Methods In this contribution we examine whether general practice based broad-spectrum computerized morbidity registration networks {{have the potential to}} act as a valid surveillance instrument of frequently occurring diseases. We compare general practice based computerized data assessing the frequency of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) with data from a well established case-specific sentinel network, the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). The overall frequency and trends of weekly ILI and ARI data are compared using both networks. Results Detection of influenza-like illness and acute respiratory illness occurs equally fast in EISS and the computerized network. The overall frequency data for ARI are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for both networks, the overall trends are similar, but the increases and decreases in frequency do not occur in exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>weeks.</b> For ILI, <b>the</b> overall rate was slightly higher for the computerized network population, especially before the increase of ILI, the overall trend was almost identical and the increases and decreases occur in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>weeks</b> for both networks. Conclusions Computerized morbidity registration networks are a valid tool for monitoring frequent occurring respiratory diseases and the detection of sudden outbreaks. </p...|$|R
