The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, {{the speed of}} the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid.

5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{referred}} to forensic autopsy halls for medicolegal examination.

The main aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the virus infection rates in <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>bodies.</b> One thousand consecutive <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> that had been referred to autopsy hall of Legal Medicine Bureau of Tehran, Iran, during 2016, were included. The blood samples were analyzed in the laboratory for detection of HBs Ag, HBs Ab, HIV Ab, and HCV Ab, after providing informed consent from legal next of kin of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>The</b> general characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> were also collected by a checklist. Forty-seven cases of HIV seropositivity, 80 cases of HBs Ag seropositivity, and 97 cases for HCV Ab seropositivity were found. Among them, 27 cases of HIV, 40 cases of anti-HBC positive, and 94 cases of RIBA testing positive for HCV were proved through confirmatory tests. In other words, 2. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> were infected with HIV, 3. 8 % with HBV, and 9 % with HCV. The total infection rate was 15. 5 %. This is a worrying risk for pathologist and autopsy technicians...|$|R
