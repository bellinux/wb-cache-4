5|$|In 1645, {{during the}} English Civil War, Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price), an opportunist and witchhunter, takes {{advantage}} of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror in East Anglia. Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. <b>They</b> <b>charge</b> the local magistrates for the work they carry out.|$|E
5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E

25|$|Investigators stated {{publicly}} {{that they did}} not believe Biryukova's story and suspected criminal activity had occurred. However they did not formally describe her as a suspect or person of interest, nor did <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> her with child endangerment despite the circumstances of the case and her past arrest, along with her then-husband, for leaving Sky in the car unsupervised.|$|E
25|$|Usury {{was still}} {{banned by the}} Church in this period, with an {{interpretation}} concisely expressed as Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury"). So the Medici Bank could not openly adopt the modern formula of promising to pay interest on demand deposits and loaning out {{a fraction of the}} deposits at greater interest to pay for the interest on the deposit, since a depositor would gain revenue on the principal without any risk to the principal, which would have made both parties usurers and sinners; nor could <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> fees or other such devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} a network of public schools, from {{nurseries}} to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum {{is the responsibility of}} the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades).|$|E

25|$|Value-added tax {{avoids the}} cascade effect of sales tax by taxing only the value added {{at each stage}} of production. For this reason, {{throughout}} the world, VAT has been gaining favor over traditional sales taxes. In principle, VAT applies to all provisions of goods and services. VAT is assessed and collected {{on the value of}} goods or services that have been provided every time there is a transaction (sale/purchase). The seller charges VAT to the buyer, and the seller pays this VAT to the government. If, however, the purchasers are not the end users, but the goods or services purchased are costs to their business, the tax they have paid for such purchases can be deducted from the tax <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> to their customers. The government only receives the difference; in other words, it is paid tax on the gross margin of each transaction, by each participant in the sales chain.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. <b>They</b> <b>charge</b> Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
500|$|In Western cultures, {{killer whales}} were {{historically}} feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written {{description of a}} killer whale was given by Pliny the Elder circa AD 70, who wrote, [...] "Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of ... <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> and pierce them like warships ramming." ...|$|E

500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} big push. There is a moment of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who would have noticed another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{continued}} to be an independent voice in the Senate. During the Red Scare, he was critical of attempts to permit illegal wiretap evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment. Nevertheless, he refused to strip Joseph McCarthy, the leading figure in the Red Scare, of his major Senate committee chairmanships, cautioning that [...] "many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> him with." [...] He was the only Republican to oppose the Bricker Amendment, which would have limited the president's treaty-making power. He concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the Constitution. He also opposed the Submerged Lands Act and the Mexican Farm Labor bill, {{both of which were}} supported by the Eisenhower administration. He denounced Eisenhower's appointment of Albert M. Cole, an open opponent of public housing, as Federal Housing Administrator and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower's Agriculture Secretary, Ezra Taft Benson. Again, his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party. In 1954, he was named to the Senate Republican Policy Committee.|$|E
2500|$|If unions {{succeed in}} wage hikes, and {{employers}} raise the prices <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> consumers {{to maintain their}} own profit margins, and the supply of money remains the same, then something else has to [...] "give." [...] Either the prices {{of goods and services}} in nonunion sectors have to fall and offset the union sector hikes, or people's cash balances need to fall, in terms of their purchasing power.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, the University of Toronto changed how <b>they</b> <b>charged</b> fees to {{students}} in the Faculty of Arts & Science. Instead of <b>charging</b> per-course fees, <b>they</b> started <b>charging</b> a flat fee - meaning that students {{would have to pay}} for five courses - even if they only took three. This amounted to a 66 per cent tuition fee increase for no service improvement.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of Krugman's interpretation, given by Austrian economics (see Austrian critiques) {{is that the}} problem is the fixed price of babysitting (wages), not of the scrip (money), alleging that the correct solution is to let couples decide how much <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> for babysitting on their own; when there is high demand or low supply of babysitters, couples would be more willing to babysit if they were given more scrip for their services.|$|E
2500|$|But the [...] "Spring Rush" [...] comes early. The large {{mobilization}} of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' {{trip to the}} claims office. The girls are left alone and spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. <b>They</b> <b>charge</b> 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa (she does go two books later).|$|E

2500|$|Electric utility {{companies}} {{generally do not}} utilize flat rate pricing. For example, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG) normally charges $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kW·h) for the base tier, but additional tiers are priced as high as $0.30 per kW·h to customers without electric vehicles. Some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate tariff that provides discounts for off-peak usage, such as overnight recharging. PG offers a special, discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers, the [...] "Experimental Time-of-Use Low Emission Vehicle rate." [...] That tariff gives people much cheaper rates if <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> at night, especially during the summer months.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of retail FX brokers [...] {{offering}} the opportunity for speculative currency trading: brokers and dealers or market makers. Brokers serve {{as an agent of}} the customer in the broader FX market, by seeking the best price {{in the market for a}} retail order and dealing on behalf of the retail customer. <b>They</b> <b>charge</b> a commission or [...] "mark-up" [...] in addition to the price obtained in the market. Dealers or market makers, by contrast, typically act as principals in the transaction versus the retail customer, and quote a price they are willing to deal at.|$|E
2500|$|Light {{from the}} sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the {{photoelectric}} effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off {{the surface of the}} Moon by electrostatic levitation. This manifests itself almost like an [...] "atmosphere of dust", visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s. It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled kilometers from the surface, and that the particles move in [...] "fountains" [...] as <b>they</b> <b>charge</b> and discharge.|$|E
