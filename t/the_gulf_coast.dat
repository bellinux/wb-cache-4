5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from {{southern}} Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24. After the initial hurricane watch from Mobile, Alabama to Sabine Pass, Texas, the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from Mobile, Alabama, to Freeport, Texas. All watches and warnings on <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> were discontinued late on August 26 after the hurricane moved inland over Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast.</b> Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E

5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on the Pacific coast and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast.</b> In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; on the Pacific coast of Baja California, the warning was in effect for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast,</b> the warning was in effect for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos.

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E
