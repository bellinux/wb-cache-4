It is shown that the numer theoretical tables have incluenfed the development of theory (and vice versa) and especially Legendre's and Gauss's work around 1800 is analysed in that light.

40|$|Dutch {{textbooks}} about {{statistics and}} data analysis at secondary school level are {{filled up with}} small, non-realistic examples. In this way students get the wrong impression that data handling is in fact nothing more than applying some standard recipe. They are not confronted with questions such as “Do the data make sense?”, “What statistical model seems applicable and for what reason?”, “Do you need more data for making sound conclusions?”, and “How {{do you deal with}} large data sets?”. This lack of focus on how to manipulate data meaningfully, using ICT tools, becomes a serious handicap for students when they explore data in a research project. Statistical reasoning and thinking are crucial when data are incomplete. The handling of so-called censored observations {{is one of the main}} issues in survival analysis. We investigated whether this extracurricular topic provides a nice opportunity for students to apply their current knowledge of statistics to a real world problem and to get acquainted with a modern, much used statistical application. We created learning materials in which students must up with their own models for handling clinical data in a hospital study. The students make use of a spreadsheet program to compute survival probabilities so that they can avoid laborious <b>tabular</b> <b>work</b> and can concentrate on model construction and model documentation. In this paper we shall present the learning materials that have been tested in practice, and we shall discuss our classroom experiences from our research perspective...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Privacy {{preserving}} {{data mining}} deals with hiding an individual’s sensitive identity without sacrificing the usability of data. It {{has become a}} very important area of concern but still this branch of research is in its infancy. People today have become {{well aware of the}} privacy intrusions of their sensitive data and are very reluctant to share their information. The major area of concern is that non-sensitive data even may deliver sensitive information, including personal information, facts or patterns. Several techniques of privacy preserving data mining have been proposed in literature. In this paper, we have studied all these state of art techniques. A <b>tabular</b> comparison of <b>work</b> done by different authors is presented. In our future work we will work on a hybrid of these techniques to preserve the privacy of sensitive data.

40|$|Cell {{suppression}} is {{a widely}} used technique for protecting sensitive information in statistical data presented in <b>tabular</b> form. Previous <b>works</b> on the subject mainly concentrate on 2 - and 3 -dimensional tables whose entries are subject to marginal totals. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} protecting sensitive data in a statistical table whose entries are linked by a generic system of linear constraints. This very general setting covers, among others, k-dimensional tables with marginals as well as the so-called hierarchical and linked tables that are very often used nowadays for disseminating statistical data. In particular, we address the optimization problem known in the literature as the (secondary) Cell Suppression Problem, in which the information loss due to suppression has to be minimized. We introduce a new integer linear programming model and outline an enumerative algorithm for its exact solution. The algorithm can also be used as a heuristic procedure to find near-optimal solutions. Extensive computational results on a test-bed of 1, 160 real-world and randomly generated instances are presented, showing the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, we were able to solve to proven optimality 4 -dimensional tables with marginals as well as linked tables of reasonable size (to our knowledge, tables of this kind were never solved optimally by previous authors).

40|$|The rare β-decay {{channel of}} 6 He into the α+d {{continuum}} was investigated at the REX-ISOLDE facility. Bunches of postaccelerated 6 He ions were implanted into the optical time projection chamber (OTPC), where the decays with emission of charged particles were recorded. This novel technique {{allowed us to}} extend the low-energy {{end of the spectrum}} down to 150 keV in α+d center of mass, corresponding to a deuteron energy of 100 keV. The branching ratio for this process amounts to [2. 78 ± 0. 07 (stat) ± 0. 17 (sys) ]× 10 ^{− 6 }. The shape of the spectrum is found to be in a good agreement with a three-body model, while the total intensity is about 20 % larger than the predicted one.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the subject. In today's service sector {{it is important not}} only to provide a service, but also to make it perform better quality. Once disappointed customer can not return back, so in order to attract a greater flow of customers, it is necessary to provide only the highest quality service and constantly look for ways to improve service quality. At this time, consumers are demanding more attention to service and quality of services provided. Prevailing positions that organization, which is able to build a good and strong service culture and providing quality service. The object of research - the public library of Jonava's quality of service. The aim - assessment of public sector services Jonava's Public Library as an example, to provide services of quality improvement recommendations. Objectives: 1. Figure out the importance of improving the quality of services and assessment issues; 2. To analyze the service quality evaluation of the theoretical and practical aspects; 3. Figure out Jonava's Public Library employees' opinions about their services and the quality of services; 4. Evaluate Jonava's public library service users about the quality of services. The main results of the work. The investigation revealed that the concept of services is closely related to their quality, and quality {{is one of the key}} service elements. In today's service sector is important not only to provide service to the customer, but also the highest quality workmanship to do it, so organizations must continually look for ways to improve service quality. Quality is one of the essential elements of the service and it is directly related to user satisfaction with the service provided. Seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the provision of services, it is essential for an objective assessment of the quality. There are distinguished three quality assessment and management models: ISO quality standards, balanced scorecard and SERVQUAL method. In order to ensure the reliability of the study was carried out two studies (quantitative and qualitative). A qualitative study was carried out with Jonava's public library staff. They were asked about library services and how they are regarded by consumers. The obtained results showed that the services provided, staff believes that satisfies consumers and users have the ability to select the most appropriate service from the library services offered. The quantitative research with consumers showed that residents of the district are likely to use the library's services. Most in demand are books borrowing, use of the Internet, search for information, advice and periodicals reading services. The study revealed that residents of Jonava's district is really satisfied with the work of the library, but it lacks new computers, a printer-friendly jobs. This work consists of 65 pages. The paper contains four sections, each with its own subdivisions. The work graphically depicted - 20 paintings. Further information is provided in <b>tabular</b> form, which <b>work</b> 8.
