5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color.

You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

The team has sold well over $100,000 worth of arts and crafts. Their efforts keep people in the developing world solvent and ancient art forms alive.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the {{defender of the}} Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction of}} the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he <b>treated</b> <b>fairly,</b> and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Although Cincinnati's African Americans were {{initially}} {{pressed into service}} at bayonet point, after the appointment of William Dickson as commander of the black troops their treatment improved significantly. Dickson promised {{that they would be}} <b>treated</b> <b>fairly</b> and kept together as a distinct unit, to be called the Black Brigade. He then allowed them to return home to prepare for military service, with orders to report the next morning for duty. About four hundred men were released that day, September 4, and the next morning about seven hundred reported for duty. Among those men was Beaty, who served in Company Number 1 of the Brigade's 3rd Regiment. Despite the danger of Confederate attack, the unarmed unit was assigned to build defenses near the Licking River in Kentucky, far in advance of the Union lines. For the next fifteen days, they cleared forests, constructed forts, magazines and roads, and dug trenches and rifle pits. The brigade was disbanded on September 20, the threat of attack having receded.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans <b>treated</b> <b>fairly.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was <b>treated</b> <b>fairly,</b> and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E

5|$|The {{institution}} {{included two}} judges, {{one for the}} civil court {{and one for the}} criminal court. In the same building were the Office and Court of Appeals. The judges of the Castellania were native Maltese and dealt with cases {{that took place in the}} district of Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities. Other districts, such as those under the courts of Mdina and Rabat, followed the same model and had to adopt decisions taken at the Castellania. On three days per week, the Fiscal Prosecutor brought cases before the judges. There was also a Cancelliere, who was responsible for receiving and preserving judicial acts, registering the sentences meted out by the judges and supervising the other workers in the courts. There was a Gran Visconte (the Chief of police) who coordinated the police, and the Capitani di notte who implemented the sentences. Other workers included an official who saw that prisoners were <b>treated</b> <b>fairly,</b> those who were responsible for the archives and advocates for legal aid. Advocates were generally Italian-speaking Maltese, as most knights and foreigners considered the position as for the inferior people. A report was drafted weekly and sent to the palace of the Grand Master, informing about occurrences presented to the Castellania.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} {{followed the}} HKEAA's announcement in 2007 {{that if a}} candidate exceeded the word limit (500 words) in a task in Section E (Practical skills for work and study), anything written beyond the limit would not be marked. However, according to the marking guidelines issued the previous year, students who did so should be deducted only two marks from the style mark for doing so. That resulted in criticism by many students, who claimed that although the word limit instruction was stated in the paper, they were not clearly informed of the marking criteria and that the marking scheme the HKEAA adopted {{in the previous year}} gave them a misleading impression. The authority later stated that candidates should have read all instructions before attempting the questions. It also stated that candidates who followed the instructions strictly should be <b>treated</b> <b>fairly.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, it was {{announced}} that Khan would defend his WBA and IBF light-welterweight titles in Washington DC on 10 December against Lamont Peterson (29-1-1, 15 KOs) at the Convention Center. In front of a near sell out crowd of 8,647, Peterson defeated Khan for the by split decision in a very controversial affair. Khan was docked 2 points in rounds 7 and 12 by the referee Joe Cooper for pushing, although illegal pushing is not usually met with such harsh consequences, the HBO team picked up on this. Peterson was dropped to the canvas twice, although the first time was counted as a slip instead of a legitimate knockdown. Both fighters boxed well and two judges scored it 113–112 to Peterson, with the other 115–110 to Khan (originally announced as 114–111 to Khan). Some observers felt it was a hometown robbery as Peterson is from Washington DC, while many felt that Khan wasn't <b>treated</b> <b>fairly.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, and the thought of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to see a doctor in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they {{had to go back to}} the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not <b>treated</b> <b>fairly,</b> arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E

500|$|In 2006–2007, MIT's {{denial of}} tenure to African-American stem cell {{scientist}} professor James Sherley reignited accusations {{of racism in}} the tenure process, eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration, a brief hunger strike, and the resignation of Professor Frank L.

500|$|Herring again {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} in May 1978 when Barry Jones revealed in Federal Parliament that during the Second World War Herring had confirmed death sentences on 22 Papuans convicted of handing over seven Anglican missionaries to the Japanese, which Jones called [...] "the darkest secret in modern Australian history". The Papuans had been convicted of offences including murder and treason. Herring claimed that they had been <b>treated</b> <b>fairly</b> under the conventions and circumstances applicable in wartime. [...] "I have a clear conscience about it", he said. The seven missionaries had all been murdered by the Japanese. Four of them were women who had been raped as well. The Papuans had also handed over to the Japanese for execution two planters, six Australian soldiers, and two American airmen, and they had murdered Australian soldiers of the 39th Infantry Battalion near Kokoda. They were handed over to ANGAU, which had carried out the executions at Higaturu in September 1943.|$|E
30|$|Ion {{exchange}} resins {{have also}} been used frequently in industry for wastewater treatment (Battaerd et al. 1973; Abdulgader et al. 2013). Documented studies reported that ion exchange technologies have the capability of <b>treating</b> <b>fairly</b> concentrated brackish water (Pless et al. 2006; Smith and Sengupta 2015). The advantages of ion exchange treatment is that high pumping pressures, extensive pre-treatment or high thermal energy input is not required. However, the process {{is limited by the}} saturation of the resin which needs large volumes of acidic and/or basic solutions for their regeneration (Hendry 1982; Pless et al. 2006; Sarkar and SenGupta, 2007).|$|R
