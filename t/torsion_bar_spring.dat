50|$|A {{volute spring}} is a {{compression}} {{spring in the}} form of a cone (a volute). Under compression the coils slide over each other, affording longer travel. The result is more stable and powerful than any leaf, coil, or <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>spring</b> in the same volume. Mounted vertically in a road wheel bogie for a pair of road wheels in a tank made a very compact unit.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis and {{the track}} were taken {{directly}} from the Leopard 1. It has <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>spring</b> mounted roadwheels with seven roadwheel pairs per side. They {{are connected to the}} torsion bars on swing arms, whose deflection is limited by volute springs. Drive is through the drive sprockets located at the rear. The Rubber-mounted shocks were modified to achieve better stability during firing. The track is manufactured by the company Diehl, rubber track pads fitted, and is [...] "live" [...] track with rubber bushings between the track links and pins (type: D 640 A). Grouser/icecleats can replace the rubber pads on some track links to increase traction on slippery surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a {{perimeter}} frame, double A-arm front suspension with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs,</b> and a {{live axle}} with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. [...] The steering mechanism {{was similar to}} a rack and pinion system except that the rack was semi-circular instead of straight.|$|R
50|$|The Alfa 90 has {{longitudinal}} front engine, {{rear mounted}} gearbox with differential lock, {{independent front suspension}} wishbones with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> and rear De Dion tube. It has disc brakes on all four wheels, the rear brakes are mounted inboard.|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{consists of}} five sets of double road wheels with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs.</b> The {{system does not}} have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork road wheels were used.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} TownAce van/wagon arrived in November 1982. As {{a response to}} the growing popularity of one-box vehicles, Toyota released the higher-end MasterAce Surf at the same time sold only at Toyota Store locations—although it was mechanically identical to the lesser TownAce with minimal cosmetic changes. The TownAce used a front mid-engine layout where the driver and front passenger sat directly above the front axle; optional four-wheel drive was introduced in December 1985. Much of the vehicle's mechanicals were based on the Toyota Hilux, including suspension components. The leaf spring rear suspension of the R10 was replaced with a four-link coil rigid suspension with a Panhard rod for the first time among Japanese cab-over-engine type van/wagons. The front suspension was of a double wishbone and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>spring</b> design.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To realize an {{efficient}} car suspension control (for instance in technical inspection) {{it is important}} to use easy measurable variables. This is the reason for developing optimization techniques in order to simplify and improve the engineering design process. The paper presents an optimization process of a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>spring</b> included in the car suspension involving the following steps: modeling and analyzing the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>spring</b> behaviour, definition of the optimization objective and the specifications for the proposed solution choosing an appropriate methodology to satisfy the design objectives. It has been used a Min-Max optimization method to highlight the vibration response (in terms of RMS) of the system. CAD analysis and MatLAB optimization are performed on the car suspension elastic element and the obtained results provide an optimum vibrational response and constructive design. This combination of these analyses can be considered {{an efficient}} tool in order to ensure the driver and passengers comfort according to the standards...|$|E
50|$|It {{was loaded}} with {{features}} that had previously not been seen on a Japanese four-wheel-drive car: a turbocharged diesel engine, a front double wishbone suspension with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs,</b> power steering and suspension seats. This made the Pajero a four-wheel-drive vehicle which integrated all the amenities of a passenger car.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} was parallel double wishbones, with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> and an anti-roll bar. Rear suspension had a live axle, also <b>sprung</b> by <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> {{and located}} by a Panhard rod and a central, transverse A-arm to control acceleration and braking forces. Brakes were Alfin drum brakes of 284.5 mm (11.2 in) diameter, and power brakes were optional. Late-model 507s had front Girling disc brakes.|$|R
25|$|The {{firmness}} of the suspension, {{and thus}} {{the quality of the}} ride, was gradually softened through the years as well, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. Interestingly, a heavy-duty suspension was offered optionally on later first generation Toronados, which included the original <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> that were used on the 1966.|$|R
50|$|It {{is powered}} by a range of {{turbocharged}} petrol or common rail diesel engines, which are able to meet the Euro V emission standards and can be equipped with Start & Stop system. It has four disk brakes with ABS and EBD, electronic stability control (ESC), MacPherson strut independent front suspension and independent rear suspension with double cross arm and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs,</b> and intelligent four-wheel-drive transmission.|$|R
5000|$|After deliberation, the {{management}} rejected Bonsch's proposal and instead ordered chief engineer Fritz Fiedler to commission Bertone {{to design and}} manufacture a coupe body for the 3200S. [...] This used a perimeter frame, a , twin-carburetor version of the BMW OHV V8 engine, delivering , [...] a four speed manual gear box, a live rear axle, disc brakes on the front wheels, and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> at all four wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The rear de Dion {{transaxle}} {{found on}} the Alfetta and derivatives- GTV, 90 and 75- provided these cars with excellent weight distribution. The advantages to handling were noticed in [...] such as Vicar. The transaxle design, in combination with a Watt's parallelogram linkage, inboard rear brakes and a well-located de Dion rear suspension, resulted in excellent traction and handling. The front suspension design was also unusual in that it incorporated independent longitudinal <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> acting directly onto the lower wishbones and with separate dampers.|$|R
50|$|Meetings in 1938 {{reduced the}} number of turrets in the {{specification}} and a move to <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> from <b>spring</b> suspension. Kotin and his assistant independently designed a single-turret version of the SMK which received Stalin's approval and the name KV. Production of two prototypes was ordered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} of the Mirada utilized transverse <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> {{in the front and}} leaf springs with a sway bar in the rear. A [...] "Sport Handling Package" [...] was offered, which included heavy-duty shock absorbers, <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> bushings, <b>springs,</b> as well as anti-sway bars in both the front and rear. The braking system used power assisted disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the rear.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} was MacPherson-like with <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> {{instead of}} <b>springs,</b> to allow {{room for the}} wide V6 and the optional air conditioning. The height of the front suspension is adjustable, using eccentric cams in {{the ends of the}} <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> where they are attached to the body.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> unlike coil <b>springs,</b> usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive spring rate. In most <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply adjusting bolts that connect the <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> to the steering knuckles. In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for a different spring rate is usually an easy task.|$|R
2500|$|Suspension {{was handled}} by double {{wishbones}} {{with coil springs}} and telescopic dampers at the front, and a de Dion tube system with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. While this arrangement had been state-of-the-art {{in the early years}} of the 1950s, by the time that the DBR4 made its first public appearance most racing car manufacturers were moving to all-round independent suspension, offering better handling, traction and road-holding than the older system employed at the rear of the Aston. [...] The DBR4 was the last new Grand Prix car to use the de Dion system. This same suspension system would be adapted to the DBR3 sports car which was being developed at the same time as the DBR4, but would be abandoned less than a year later when the DBR3 was considered a failure. [...] To bring the car to a halt, Girling disc brakes were fitted all round.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTorsion <b>bar</b> <b>springs</b> are {{dynamically}} loaded {{machine elements}} which can break due to fatigue. High strength fine-grain steel, grade VCN is normally used for springs or shafts. Springs {{are used as}} shock absorbers in caterpillar machines, where the diameters and lengths of the springs are limited. Springs should meet the requirements regarding spring constant (applied torque vs. twist angle), twist angle magnitude, and overcome the prescribed fatigue lifetime (number of fatigue cycles to failure). Using twist angle, {{it is possible to}} increase the elastic-plastic presetting of a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar.</b> A <b>spring</b> made as a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> may exhibit different fatigue behaviour regarding to different elastic-plastic presetting torques. Experimentally obtained results show that fatigue lifetime strongly depends on the ratio between the preset elastic-plastic torque and the applied fatigue loading range. A model for fatigue lifetime and shear stress level is proposed in spite of relative small number of tested specimens...|$|R
5000|$|Early 205s {{used the}} X engine (commonly nicknamed the Douvrin [...] "Suitcase Engine") {{from the older}} Peugeot 104, {{although}} these were later (1987-1988) replaced with the newer XU and TU-series engines, which were of PSA design. Engines ranged from 954 cc to 1905 cc engine displacement, in carburettor or fuel injected petrol and diesel versions. Its use of the now standard PSA Peugeot Citroën suspension layout of MacPherson struts at the front, with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension rear suspension, that debuted in the Peugeot 305 estate, was a key ingredient {{of the success of}} the 205. This is fully independent using <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> (<b>Torsion</b> <b>spring)</b> and trailing arms. It is very compact and was designed to minimise suspension intrusion into the boot, giving a wide flat loadspace, while providing excellent ride and handling.|$|R
50|$|By World War II {{the other}} common type was <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension, getting <b>spring</b> force from {{twisting}} bars inside the hull — this sometimes had less travel than the Christie-type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with consequent possibility to install larger turret rings {{and thus a}} heavier main armament. The torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II. <b>Torsion</b> <b>bars</b> may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} system {{was based on}} longitudinal <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for primary <b>springing</b> and featured fully independent suspension at all four wheels using double wishbones. Each wheel station was also fitted with a rubber cone and cup system to buffer extreme upward suspension travel with energy control exercised by double-acting telescopic hydraulic dampers. This system gave an exceptional cross-country performance. Front and rear axles were constructed into a cradle sub-assembly, which could be rapidly exchanged in the field.|$|R

50|$|In 1934 the Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne {{started work}} on a Polish luxury car for {{government}} officials that would replace foreign automobiles. The project was led by Kazimierz Studzinski, and in five months the car was designed and a chassis was complete. The car was of a simple, yet modern construction designed by Alexsander Rummel and Mieczysław Dębicki based on a central frame of two C-profiled beams. The car was called the Lux-Sport (or L-S) and had a completely independent suspension and used very long <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> as <b>springing</b> elements. The number of produced prototypes is not known, {{but at least one}} complete prototype, and one chassis for exhibitions were built.The PZInż 403 could have entered production in the 1940s, but the plans were abruptly stopped by the outbreak of World War II.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was closely}} derived from {{that on the}} Morris Minor, using longitudinal <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for <b>springing.</b> The rest of the front suspension consisted of lower arms pivoting on trunnions with upper ball joints supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic lever arm dampers. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early telescopic dampers, {{at the expense of}} 'sloppy' handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the motorway network, the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper wholly obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless this setup was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CB500T was a Honda {{motorcycle}} sold in 1975 and 1976.

The engine was a [...] double overhead cam (DOHC) vertical parallel twin with 180° crankshaft angle, dual CV carburetors and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> valve <b>springs.</b> The transmission was a 5-speed. While not receiving much praise from critics and riders alike, Cycle World took note of its comfortable and roomy seat in its 1975 test, writing, [...] "Unusual {{in that it is}} brown in color, it is long enough to carry a briefcase or passenger without crowding the rider. And the padding is soft enough for comfort. Believe us, without this seat you couldn’t ride a 500T very far and get off smiling." ...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Progress 4WDS" [...] was Kyosho's first {{electric}} 4WD off-road racer. The motor {{was mounted}} on the rear overhang, and the forward wheel moves with a chain extending from the rear gearbox. This chain system was also tried on the on-road racer, [...] "Fantom EP." [...] The rear suspension was an orthodox double trailing arm and oil damper with coil springs, but the front suspension featured a double wishbone and mono damper, and substituted a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> for a <b>spring.</b> This unique front suspension was rather difficult to set up, and had a short arm, which prevented it from taking powerful strokes.|$|R
5000|$|The Mazda B-Series {{pickup truck}} was {{introduced}} in Japan in August 1961 as the B1500 (BUA61). This model was the only Japanese market model to be badged under the B-Series naming scheme, i.e. B1500. The BUD61 (second generation) that followed was the first model of the long-running [...] "Proceed" [...] series sold in Japan. It had a 1,484 cc OHV water-cooled engine with wet sleeve cylinders which produced , and a one-ton payload. This model also had a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> front/leaf <b>spring</b> rear suspension, which was advanced for its time, giving it a relatively smooth ride. The B1500 was remodeled between late 1962 and September 1963; it received a new chassis code, BUB61. The BUB61 was more spacious; its cabin was extended by 80 mm {{and it had a}} stretched body and wheelbase. The BUB61 had a new, upside-down, trapezoidal grille instead of the earlier full-width unit, with thirteen bars rather than nine, turn signals on the fenders, and more chrome trim—including a decor strip on the side.|$|R
5000|$|BMP-1 (Ob'yekt 765Sp1) (Sp {{stands for}} spetsifikatsiya - specification) - An early type with a shorter nose section {{and a larger}} angled plate {{at the top of}} the hull line. The two tool stowage boxes on the fenders were removed. The swim vanes were {{modified}} by reducing the number of vanes from seven to four and the fender profile was raised nearer to the horizontal. The fume extraction ports on the hull roof to the rear of the turret were moved outwards and reoriented to point toward the rear of the vehicle. The single <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> used to <b>spring</b> the rear roof troop hatches was replaced by a twin <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> system. The firing ports on the side were moved up into the armor plate, giving the weapons used in the ports a higher degree of elevation. The vehicle weighs 12.6 tonnes. It was built from 1966 to 1969. It is sometimes incorrectly known as the BMP-A by some Western sources. NATO gave it the designation BMP Model 1966.|$|R
500|$|Development {{of the new}} {{tank was}} offered to five {{separate}} manufacturers: Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX), Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM), Renault, Societe Lorraine de Dietrich (SLD-Lorraine) and Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (SOMUA). The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> <b>sprung</b> road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|R
5000|$|For 1969, a major restyle {{brought a}} {{dramatic}} new look to all full sized Chrysler Corporation cars.

Plymouth and Dodge models, excluding wagons, shared passenger compartment structures and greenhouses riding on 120” and 122” wheelbases respectively. Similarly, Chrysler and Imperial models, excluding T&C wagon, shared slightly longer passenger compartments and greenhouses, riding on 124” and 127” wheelbases respectively (all of the Imperial’s longer wheelbase was in the front clip). As in the prior generation, all Chrysler Corp. full sized wagons shared a common greenhouse on a unitized body and chassis with longitudinal front <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> rear leaf <b>springs</b> and the Dodge’s 122” wheelbase. And, as before, the wagon’s shorter wheelbase was offset by additional rear overhang. 1969 Town and Country wagons were nearly identical to other Chrysler body styles in overall length at just under 225”.|$|R
40|$|The modern-day {{armoured}} fighting vehicles (AFVs) {{are basically}} tracked {{vehicles equipped with}} hydro gas suspensions, in lieu of conventional mechanical suspensions like <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> and coil <b>spring</b> bogie suspensions. The uniqueness of hydro gas suspension is that it offers a nonlinear spring rate, which is very much required for the cross-country moveability of a tracked vehicle. The AFVs have to negotiate different cross-country terrains like sandy, rocky, riverbed, etc. and the road irregularities provide enumerable problems during dynamic loadings {{to the design of}} hydro gas suspension system. Optimising various design parameters demands innovative design methodologies to achieve better ride performance. Hence, a comprehensive kinematic analysis is needed. In this study, a methodology has been derived to optimise the kinematics of the suspension by reorienting the cylinder axis and optimising the load-transferring leverage factor so that the side thrust on the cylinder is minimised to a greater extent. The optimisation ultimately increases the life of the high-pressure and high-temperature piston seals, resulting in enhanced system life for better dependability...|$|R
