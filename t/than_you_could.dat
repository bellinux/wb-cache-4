500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Sober" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with several declaring it an album highlight. Comparing its production to {{the works of}} Australian recording artist Sia, George Griffiths of Redbrick deemed it the best song of Gomez's career; praising its placement as the album's musical centerpiece. He elaborated that the themes of empowerment and vulnerability present throughout Revival coalesced into [...] "Sober" [...] "more clearly and coherently <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever have imagined". In her review, Concrete writer Melissa Haggar called [...] "Sober" [...] a key example of the personal and meaningful lyrics behind Revival, calling the track [...] "somber and satisfying". Haggar {{went on to say}} that the singer: [...] "reflects similar melancholy emotions in bonus tracks like the bittersweet ballad 'Nobody' and the sweeping 'Cologne', which display her more vulnerable side." [...] Idolator writer Mike Wass felt that the track was among the album's best tracks, and compared it to Alessia Cara's single [...] "Here" [...] from her debut album Know-It-All (2015) and Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine (2013), saying [...] "With the rise of relatable-pop, this bittersweet pop anthem should get a warm reception at radio. Emo posturing doesn’t get any catchier." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ I was too young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, {{and not only}} that, it sticks to the ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E

"Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that {{is influenced by}} pop and RB& music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we said let go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under your thumb / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past." [...] MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard described the song in detail: ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1994 book My Singing Teachers, Tormé cited Patty Andrews, {{lead singer}} of the Andrews Sisters, {{one of the most}} {{successful}} show business acts of the 1940s, as one of his favorite vocalists, saying, [...] "They had more hit records to their credit <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> count, and one of the main reasons for their popularity was Patty Andrews. She stood in the middle of her sisters, planted her feet apart, and belted out solos as well as singing the lead parts with zest and confidence. The kind of singing she did cannot be taught, it can't be studied in books, it can't be written down. Long experience as a singer and wide-open ears were her only teachers, and she learned her lessons well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gallifrey is the {{umbrella}} {{title of a}} series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions, set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President.

[...] Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer Gary Russell indicated in a forum posting on Outpost Gallifrey that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.|$|E

2500|$|Monáe's {{roots in}} Kansas City, Kansas, {{where she was}} born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan's Pitchfork feature on Monáe, the song [...] "Ghetto Woman" [...] {{directly}} addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line [...] "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be." [...] Monáe also told the London Evening Standard that she has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let [...] "her community down". On her album The ArchAndroid, especially in songs like [...] "Cold War" [...] or [...] "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates [...] "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas". Kansas City, therefore, represents not only Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on her lyrics and science-fictional setting.|$|E

In their review they stated, [...] "For the second time in succession, Naughty Dog has created a game that can claim to not only be the best on PS3, but also {{one of the best in}} gaming history...
