5|$|The county road {{designation}} continues {{north on}} Wright Street. This segment of CR492 {{is separated from}} the southern section by US41/M-28. Traffic crossing between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> to use the main highway through median turn arounds in a maneuver similar to a Michigan left. The roadway leaves the commercial corridor and returns to woodland before the intersection with Forestville Road and Commerce Drive. Wright Street curves to the northeast and then the east crossing into the westernmost section of the City of Marquette. As Wright Street continues eastward, it runs through a residential section along {{part of the city}} line before completely crossing into Marquette. The roadway passes the Holy Cross Cemetery and {{the north side of the}} campus of Northern Michigan University (NMU). The northern main entrance to campus is located at the intersection with CR550 (Sugar Loaf Avenue) and Tracy Avenue. Wright Street passes through residential neighborhoods east of CR550 before meeting Presque Isle Avenue. East of that intersection, CR492 crosses onto the northern edge of NMU's campus immediately north of the Superior Dome. Wright Street ends as it curves around to the south into a junction with Lakeshore Boulevard at the shore of Lake Superior.|$|E

25|$|Under the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, the EU and Israel {{have free}} trade in {{industrial}} products. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> granted each other significant trade concessions for certain agricultural products, {{in the form}} of tariff reduction or elimination, either within quotas or for unlimited quantities.|$|E
50|$|Note: The 1920 Five Nations Championship {{was known}} in France as le match des borgnes (the one-eyed match) because five players between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> lost an eye in World War I.|$|R

25|$|Copenhagen plays its matches at the Telia Parken, {{which also}} serves as the venue for Denmark {{national}} football team matches. Since founding, FCK have developed a fierce rivalry with Brøndby IF. The Copenhagen Derby games between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> attracted {{some of the biggest}} crowds in Danish football history.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> rarely met since Leeds' relegation {{from the}} Premier League.

25|$|Another notable rival of the Brumbies is the Crusaders. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> met {{in three}} grand finals (The Brumbies winning {{one and the}} Crusaders two). In common with the Waratah rivalry the away side rarely wins in {{encounters}} between the two sides. The Brumbies are the only team to have scored 50 points against the Crusaders and have recorded the highest ever score in a grand final (48 points) against this side. The Brumbies remain one of few sides to have a competitive win/loss record against the Crusaders.|$|E
25|$|The other most {{significant}} rivalry is with Juventus; the two {{participate in the}} Derby d'Italia. Up until the 2006 Italian football scandal, which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. In recent years, post-Calciopoli, Inter have developed a rivalry with Roma, having finished runners-up to Inter {{in all but one}} of Inter's five Scudetto-winning seasons between 2005 and 2010. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006.

Furthermore, oil revenues will be divided equally between the government and rebels during the six-year interim period. The ability or willingness of the government to fulfill these promises has been questioned by some observers, however, and the status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations. Some observers wondered whether hard line elements in the north would allow the treaty to proceed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> a pitched fight, using spears {{as well as}} fists. As the men {{approached}} Ely, {{however, the}} thieves {{had the advantage of}} knowing their way through the swamps and marshes. They were successful at reinterring Wihtburh in Ely.|$|R
50|$|Under Wilson, the Oakland school {{district}} also negotiated a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} with its teacher and education paraprofessional unions in 2016. It {{was the first time}} since 2009 that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> been able to reach an agreement.|$|R

The three find themselves on the Dalek planet of Skaro. A generations-long war between the Thals and the Kaleds has left the planet inhospitable, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> congregated in their own domes for protection and continue the war.|$|E
500|$|The scene {{takes place}} in Hog Lane, part of the slum {{district}} of St Giles with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the background. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows Huguenots leaving the French Church {{in what is now}} Soho. The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in the silk trade; and the French Church was their first place of worship. Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group {{on the other side of}} the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> in common. The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress, while the younger members wear the fashions of the day. The children are dressed up as adults: the boy in the foreground struts around in his finery while the boy with his back to the viewer has his hair in a net, [...] bagged up in the [...] "French" [...] style.|$|E

Galway's lone All-Ireland defeat of Kilkenny came in 1987, while there has been one drawn decider.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> met at St James' Park on 24 January 1972 for the {{scheduled}} Third Round match, the match having been postponed twice for rain. 5,000 Hereford supporters made {{the journey to}} the North-East with Newcastle clear favourites, fielding six internationals in their side.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> traded war {{declarations}} and gunfire {{on several}} occasions before.

2500|$|The Chennai Super Kings have active rivalries {{with the}} Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have played {{against each other}} more number of times than any other two teams in the IPL.

According to Bivol, [...] "After the completion of each stage, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> exchanged protocols for their work, and then the work has been paid for." [...] Vitosha (the Israeli investors) paid Ultrastroy (the Bulgarian construction firm) over 12 million levs through phase nine (of ten), until the project was nearly completed.|$|E
2500|$|Richmond – A rivalry {{that began}} {{as a result of}} North's loss to Richmond in the 1974 Grand Final, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> shared an on and off rivalry ever since. Both sides since their 1975 {{preliminary}} final meeting (which North Melbourne won) have mostly been unsuccessful on the field. The rivalry re-ignited in the 2010s due to the clubs recent on field success and accumulated in a clash during the 2015 AFL finals series which North won by 17 points and was preceded by a provocative banner which read, 'Tigers Don't Win Finals, We Do'.|$|E
5000|$|According to Thomas de Waal, {{the well}} known British analyst, it {{was shot down}} [...] "in the no-man's land between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> armies" [...] and added that the {{helicopter}} [...] "was not attacking Azerbaijani positions but had apparently broken into an informal five-kilometer no-fly zone <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had</b> agreed on." ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the allied}} gains of 1733, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>had,</b> between this battle {{and that at}} San Pietro, killed or wounded about 12,000 men, and the 1734 {{campaign}} ended about where it began.
