50|$|A {{survey is}} a {{systematic}} method of collecting information {{on one or}} more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The {{purpose of the study}} was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs.|$|E
