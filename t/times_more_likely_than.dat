5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen {{times more likely to}} develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
25|$|Obesity also {{increases}} the risk of CTS: individuals classified as obese (BMI > 29) are 2.5 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> slender individuals (BMI < 20) to be diagnosed with CTS.|$|E

25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual {{harassment}} is three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers {{may also be a}} result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical {{sexual harassment}}. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps {{it out of}} the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The {{majority of}} people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or venlafaxine (all P-gp substrates). The study included patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 27 million Americans, {{or nearly}} 11% of the population, have diabetes, {{according}} to the American Diabetes Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2050, the prevalence of diabetes could increase {{to as much as}} 33% of the population, largely due to the aging of the population and to people with diabetes living longer. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with diabetes are two to four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.|$|E

50|$|Life {{expectancy}} in {{the greater}} DTES area is 79.9 years, a significant improvement since the mid-1990s. Some of the increase may, however, {{be explained by the}} migration of healthier residents to the neighbourhoods surrounding the DTES.

25|$|This data {{comes from}} Table 3 Model 4 of the Zhang paper, which {{incorporates}} all controls into the model. White husband, white wife pairings {{are used as}} a control.

25|$|Gluon fusion. If the {{collided}} {{particles are}} hadrons {{such as the}} proton or antiproton—as {{is the case in}} the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> any of the other processes.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer health {{outcomes}} than men for several reasons ranging from sustaining greater risk to diseases to experiencing higher mortality rates. In the Population Studies Center Research Report by Rachel Snow that compares the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of both male and females, the global DALYs lost to females for sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are more than ten times greater {{than those of the}} males. Moreover, the female DALYs to male DALYs ratio for malnutrition-related diseases such as Iron-Deficiency Anemia are often close to 1.5, suggesting that poor nutrition impacts women at a much higher level than men. Additionally, in terms of mental illnesses, women are also two to three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to be diagnosed with depression. With regards to suicidal rates, up to 80% of those who committed suicide or attempted suicide in Iran are women.|$|E

2500|$|Britain's school system, despite {{efforts to}} address issues of discrimination, has often been accused of racism through {{undermining}} the self-confidence of all Black children and maligning the culture of their parents. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, {{a disproportionate number of}} Caribbean migrant children were classified as [...] "educationally subnormal" [...] and placed in special schools and units. By the end of the 1980s, the chances of white school leavers finding employment were four times better than those of Black pupils. In 2000–01, Black pupils were three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> white pupils and ten <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Indian pupils to be officially excluded from school for disciplinary reasons.

[...] Between 2004 and 2012 the Department was, on average, 11.51 times more likely to arrest an African American person than a white person for marijuana possession.
