5|$|But Dostoyevsky's work, {{polyphonic}} in nature, also {{states that}} the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and {{in the face of}} evil, the beauty <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> the world.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|Dark Angel: After the Dark (2003) follows Skin Game. It is {{revealed}} that Max's virus is gone, {{the most likely}} explanation being that when the virus killed Kelpy it went dormant as it believed its mission to kill Logan was accomplished. However, Logan and Max's relationship is thrown into turmoil when he reveals that he inadvertently caused Seth's death by sending him on an assignment. Just as Max is ready to forgive him, Logan is kidnapped by Ames White and the breeding cult, who are preparing for the coming of a comet they believe will destroy everyone except cult-members and transgenics through depositing viral material into Earth's atmosphere. They are trying to kill Max as they believe she possesses a genetic code <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> ordinary humans from the comet's viral material. With {{the aid of a}} team of transgenics, Max eventually rescues Logan and destroys the headquarters of the breeding cult; Joshua kills Ames White. When the comet arrives, nobody falls ill, and it is believed the cult's prediction was false. Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell at the cult's headquarters. He promises to help her find her mother if she saves him, and she agrees. The book ends with Logan and Max finally consummating their relationship.|$|E

25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} families will fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, {{and is one of}} the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E
25|$|Yaroslavna weeps at her {{separation}} from Igor and {{the defeat of}} his army, blaming the very elements themselves for helping the enemy (Yaroslavna's Lament). Peasant women blame not the wind but Khan Gzak for the devastation. As Yaroslavna looks around to acknowledge the destruction, she sees two riders in the distance who {{turn out to be}} Igor and Ovlur. The two lovers sing of their joy of being reunited and of the expectation that Ivan will lead the Russians to victory against the Khan. Unaware of Igor's return, Skula and Yeroshka, the drunken gudok players, sing a song that mocks him. Then they notice him in the distance. After a moment of panic about what will happen to them, Skula says that they should rely on their cunning and decides on a plan <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> them. They ring the church bells to summon a crowd. Although people at first treat them with suspicion, the gudok players manage to convince the crowd that Igor has returned and the boyars that they are loyal followers of the true prince and not Galitsky. All joyously celebrate Igor's return.|$|E

500|$|The Stadler KISS {{double-decker}} EMU that Caltrain ordered will be {{compliant with}} the FRA alternative Tier-I crash-worthiness standard. Under the alternative standard, {{it will have}} Crash Energy Management (CEM) features that allow parts of the EMU to collapse whilst keeping the passenger seating area intact {{in the event of}} collision, instead of relying on pure structural strength as in the traditional Tier-I standard. The implementation of the alternative Tier-I standard results in a lighter train <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>save</b> energy and track maintenance cost. Coupled with the positive train control system that is being installed on the Caltrain line, Caltrain KISS trains will be allowed to operate in mixed traffic with heavier trains, such as Amtrak passenger trains and Union Pacific freight trains, instead of the temporal separation required in the 2009 waiver.|$|E

He added that [...] "like many other bands, they have added some more electronic elements, which makes Save Rock and Roll a bit too well produced and non-organic." [...] Andy Baber of musicOMH called the album both the group's [...] "softest" [...] and the group's [...] "least memorable." [...] At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff found that the [...] "11-song set has {{more in common with}} Rihanna than the Ramones, which will undoubtedly polarize those faithful".|$|E

2500|$|Block and Jöns enter {{a church}} where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted.
