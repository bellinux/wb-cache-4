5|$|In 1998, as {{a result}} of the {{continuing}} development in the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the Privy Council approved the necessary changes to the university's Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became The University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, the university and Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004. This move ended the federal partnership between the two institutions, although collaboration between the two is being maintained.|$|E

In 1993 King's, along with other large University of London colleges, gained direct access to government funding (which had previously been through <b>the</b> <b>university)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right to confer University of London degrees itself. This contributed to King's and the other large colleges being regarded as de facto universities in their own right.|$|E
