40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in short-term and long-term interest rates. REITs were found to be sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the long-term interest rates in 1973 - 1979, but in 1980 - 1985, REITs were sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in both short-term and long-term rates. These sources of interest-rate sensitivity were also found to be different for equity and mortgage REITs. Equity REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in expected inflation, whereas mortgage REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> both <b>changes</b> in expected inflation and changes in the real rate. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} the sensitivity of Canadian import demand <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in income, prices, and exchange rates. The model specification allows for the consideration of long-run elasticities {{as well as the}} dynamics of short-run adjustment of imports <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in these variables. The estimated long-run elasticities obtained are similar to those in previous studies. It is also shown that Canadian imports react quickly <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in either foreign or domestic prices, but that the reaction <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in exchange rates is much slower. ...|$|R

Each of these is discussed and illustrated by means of examples from economic practice. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the U. S. economy seems to have become less {{responsive}} <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in monetary policy. Unusually slow recoveries followed recessions in 1990 - 91, 2001, and 2007 - 09 despite sizeable mone-tary accommodation from the Federal Reserve. Employment, in particular, appears to have become less sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in long-term interest rates. Shifts in interest sensitivity could stem {{from a variety of}} factors. Jonathan L. Willis and Guangye Cao investigate potential sources of the economy’s shifting interest sensitivity by examining how total employment responds <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in monetary policy. The results suggest the economy’s interest sensi-tivity has declined due not <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the conduct of monetary policy, but <b>to</b> structural <b>changes</b> within industries and financial markets...|$|R

The estimates of pension elasticities suggest that {{the response of}} the low income group <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in pensions is the strongest, whereas the response of the middle income group is the weakest.
