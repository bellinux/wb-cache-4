Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham.

40|$|ABSTRACT Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel {{retailers}} from {{developed countries}} have started to source globally instead of manufacturing products domestically to reduce costs and become more competitive in <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel markets. However, since global sourcing has extended organizations 2 ̆ 7 supply chains on a worldwide scale, other factors, such as suppliers 2 ̆ 7 capability lead time, logistics service, and trade barriers, should also be seriously considered. Therefore, it is important for buyers to determine the comparative advantages of supplier countries, and suppliers to understand the determinants of their export performance to become more competitive in the era of trade liberalization. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the emerging trends and determinants of Asian developing countries 2 ̆ 7 <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performances over the twelve years (2000 - 2011). The research framework in this study was built on the theory of comparative advantages and global value chain framework. The main analysis was conducted in three stages: (1) analyzing the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance among 11 Asian developing countries, (2) testing the hypothesized relationships between determinants <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance using a vector auto-regressive (VAR) errors model approach, and (3) comparing the impact of determinants on <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance. SPSS 17. 0 and SAS 9. 3 were used to analyze secondary data sets collected from each country 2 ̆ 7 s available industry and government databases. This study implied that <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel manufacturing industry is a sunset industry in Asian developing countries. In addition, <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance can be influenced by economic levels, immediate and short term impacts. This study also verified elimination of the quota system influence on Asian developing countries comparative advantages and leads to global <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel industry under reconstruction. This study demonstrated that low labor costs may be comparative advantages for Asian developing countries to attract buyer sourcing in Asian, but for a specific Asian developing country, low labor costs will not be the most crucial comparative advantage. Manufacturing competence is not a crucial determinant for <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance in Asian developing countries. Logistics performance has a closer relationship with <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance than lead time. Currency exchange rate has a different impact on <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performances among Asian developing countries. Tariffs had a negative impact on <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance in Asian developing countries, especially after the elimination of the quota system. This study makes an important step towards understanding the determinants of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance, and aids in building a research model of determinants for <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export performance in Asian developing countries. The research provides a number of practical implications for both supplier countries and global sourcing managers in international trade...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{significant}} contributions of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel industry {{in terms of}} employment, export opportunities and industrial value added, it has {{a crucial role in}} the Turkish economy. Even there are many factors influencing the export performance of this sector, real exchange rate is one of the significant factors. In this study, we investigated the causal relationship between the real exchange rate <b>and</b> export of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel industry by using monthly data, covering from 1998 - 2008. Exchange rate volatility was also considered in the model using GARCH approach. In order to determine appropriate Granger causality relations, unit root, cointegtration and error correction models were used. With time-series techniques, this study provided evidence that there is a long-run relationship exist between the real exchange rate <b>and</b> export of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel industry. Based on the results of the model it was concluded that increasing exchange rate volatility negatively impacts on <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> apparel export.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to forecast the future trade patterns and to identify the determinants of exports of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing.

To quantify the impacts of causal factors on imports and exports, we developed an econometric model and found that financial liquidity, endogenous production of cotton and the magnitude of imported raw material and intermediate goods are the root-causes of export of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing products, while, GDP <b>and</b> exports of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing products are identified as good predictors of import of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing products.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{estimate}} the evolution of Latvia’s <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing industry. The Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing industry is traditionally highly export-oriented. Approximately 80 % of the sector's manufacturing output was exported in 2006. Historically based on {{a small number of}} giant enterprises, the sector has evolved into a virtual cluster with a many newly emerged flexible and specialised SMEs. The major markets for Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing goods are EU member states (~ 76 % of exports), where product quality is a prerequisite. Methodology/Approach – The paper shows the results of situation analysis in Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing industry using a database of Associations of <b>Textile</b> <b>and</b> Clothing Industry and questionnaire of enterprises. Findings – The results of research shows the evolution of Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> clothing industry during the last five years, the sector's main strengths and market potentials in future. Research limitations/implications – The research has only been carried out on a very limited number of subjects. It is caused by a very low level of cooperation of Latvia’s textile enterprises in such researches. However, as Latvia is a small country, data for this research was sufficient and the results clearly show the situation.
