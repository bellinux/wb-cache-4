5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> run.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hike in {{the local}} woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing {{in front of a}} live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began with}} an auspicious start for Michigan, as they scored on the first {{play of the game}} from {{scrimmage}} with a 75-yard touchdown reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois responded with two field goals by Derek Dimke: first from 43 yards, and then from 44 yards out. In the second quarter, Illinois took the lead with a touchdown yard run by Nathan Scheelhaase, and completed a 2-point conversion to Ryan Lankford. Michigan tied it up with a 33-yard reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois retook the lead with a 62-yard reception by Jason Ford. Michigan tied it back up with a 4-yard run by Stephen Hopkins, and took the lead back with a 45-yard reception by Junior Hemingway. The first half ended with 2 field goals that left the game tied: a 35-yard Michigan field goal, and a 43-yard Illinois field goal. Contrary to the explosive nature of the first half, the third quarter was relatively quiet, with the only scoring being an 18-yard run by Michigan's Michael Shaw. The fourth quarter saw a reemergence of offense, as Illinois tied it back up with a 27-yard reception by Mikel Leshoure and then took the lead with a 1-yard run by Leshoure. Michigan was able to tie the game late with a 9-yard catch by Darryl Stonum. Illinois chose to run out the clock, taking it to overtime. In the first overtime, Michigan got the ball first and Michael Shaw ran in a 5-yard touchdown. Mikel Leshoure then ran in a 1-yard touchdown, forcing double overtime. Illinois received the ball to start the second overtime, and Mikel Leshoure caught a 25-yard touchdown on the first play. Junior Hemingway then caught a 9-yard touchdown, forcing triple overtime. Michigan got the ball first to start the third overtime and scored on a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. By rule, the Wolverines had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2-point conversion, which they completed with a pass to Junior Hemingway. Illinois' Mikel Leshoure ran in a 3-yard touchdown, but the 2-point conversion attempt failed, giving Michigan the win.|$|E

Cal's Jared Goff followed with a 23-yard TD to Kenny Lawler with seven minutes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 34–33 lead.

25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Auburn {{threatened}} twice to score the game's first points, {{but could not}} convert on either occasion. First, the Tigers used running plays by halfbacks Spec Kelly and Jimmy Fenton to go into Michigan State's half of the field, ultimately reaching the Spartans' 12-yard-line; the drive included a 25-yard rush by Fenton. Following three runs, the Tigers faced a fourth down play, and elected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first down or touchdown. Fenton attempeted a pass, but it was incomplete, and Auburn lost possession to Michigan State. The Spartans punted back to the Tigers, and John Pingel's kick went out of bounds at Auburn's 37-yard-line. Kelly picked up one first down with a 17-yard rush, and a second on a pass to Dutch Heath. Auburn, however, turned the ball over on a Tom McShannock interception of a Kelly pass attempt. McShannock returned the interception 29 yards downfield, but the Spartans were unable to gain a first down during the subsequent drive. Late in the quarter, Kelly gained 26 yards on a running play, giving the Tigers a field position advantage.|$|E
