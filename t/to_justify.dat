5|$|Candide, the impressionable and incompetent {{student of}} Pangloss, often tries <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> evil, fails, invokes his mentor and {{eventually}} despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his optimism.|$|E

5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{held that}} {{conspiracy}} {{to wage war}} on the United States was not treason. Further, Bollman held that the evidence against both Bollman and Swartwout was insufficient <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> pre-trial detention.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received.

40|$|Rotter's social {{learning}} theory and signal detection theory are discussed separately and then compared. Adams applied these theories {{and the concept of}} expectation to aggression. Adams conducted, two studies in this area {{with the aid of a}} questionnaire which he devised. His results indicated that sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>justified</b> vs. unjustified aggression as indexed by d' is related to problem behavior or aggressive behavior as shown by institutionalization or by rating measures. In the present study with 70 eighth grade students, it was found that on two of the three scales least aggressive students were more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>justified</b> vs. unjustified aggression.

50|$|The philosopher Alvin Plantinga {{has shifted}} his focus <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> belief in God (that is, {{those who believe}} in God, for {{whatever}} reasons, are rational in doing so) through Reformed epistemology, {{in the context of a}} theory of warrant and proper cognitive function.|$|R
5|$|Talented slaves with a {{knack for}} {{business}} might accumulate a large enough peculium <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered.

5|$|The Jones {{precedent}} {{has been}} used <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> Congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking.

The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality.

5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel.

A small number of separate statutory offences have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary offences, in which case, usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E
