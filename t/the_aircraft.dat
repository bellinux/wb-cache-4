5|$|On 4 April 2008, B-1B (s/n 86-0116) lost {{hydraulic}} power while taxiing, then {{crashed into a}} concrete barrier and caught fire at Al Udeid AB, Qatar. The crew safely evacuated <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was carrying several bombs at the time, most of which detonated in succession during the fire. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{involved}} in the accident was a Boeing 707–465 registered G-ARWE (manufacturer's serial number 18373, Boeing line number 302). First flown on 27 June 1962, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was originally to have been operated by Cunard Eagle Airways, but before it entered service it was sold to BOAC-Cunard and was delivered on 7 July 1962. On 21 November 1967 <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> suffered an engine failure on take off from Honolulu International Airport. The take off was aborted, {{and there were no}} injuries to any of the passengers or crew. At the time of the Heathrow accident, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> had flown for a total of 20,870 hours. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was insured for £2,200,000 with Lloyd's of London.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> virtual model. The position of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the airport or factory is not known precisely; the cobot needs to detect <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> in order to know its position and orientation relative to <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, either with the laser data from its laser range finders, or with image data from its cameras.|$|E
50|$|On July 23, 1983, Flight 143 was {{cruising}} at 12500 m over Red Lake, Ontario. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft's</b> cockpit {{warning system}} sounded, indicating a fuel pressure problem on <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> left side. Assuming a fuel pump had failed the pilots turned it off, since gravity should feed fuel to <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> two engines. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft's</b> fuel gauges were inoperative {{because of an}} electronic fault indicated on the instrument panel and airplane logs.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{the density}} {{altitude}} {{is used to}} assess <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> aerodynamic performance under certain weather conditions. The lift generated by <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> airfoils and <b>the</b> relation between indicated and true airspeed are also subject to air density changes. Furthermore, the power delivered by <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> engine {{is affected by the}} air density and air composition.|$|R
50|$|The {{maneuvering}} {{speed of}} an aircraft is shown on a cockpit placard and in <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> flight manual {{but is not}} commonly shown on <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> airspeed indicator.|$|R
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> and satellite indicates the relative motion of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E
5|$|A Delta Air Lines 757-200, {{registered}} as N608DA, {{is on display}} at the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was the sixty-fourth example built. Prior to being moved to its permanent location, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was repainted in its originally delivered livery; it is now on static display at the museum entrance.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Huseby helped {{the police in}} the negotiations. At 18:30, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was out of beer, so Huseby made an {{agreement}} that he would throw the gun {{out of the window}} in exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E
50|$|The {{modified}} bombers {{contained no}} bomb racks. Instead, the few bombs they carried were pushed out <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> belly by a human 'bomb-chucker' who {{was tied to}} <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> frame with rope.|$|R
5000|$|On November 23, 2016, {{the front}} landing gear {{of a general}} {{aviation}} aircraft fell off and caused major damage to <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> underside. Both of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> 2 occupants made it out safely.|$|R
2500|$|The crash, which {{occurred}} on 31 July 1979 [...] offshore following <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> failure to take off, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> destruction and 17 deaths of 47 on board (15 of 44 passengers and both pilots).|$|R
5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be {{moved from the}} hold by <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|Air Europe {{fell under}} {{financial}} distress in 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in Norway Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> remained grounded {{when the military}} contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but Norway Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E
5|$|Aircrew {{training}} {{using the}} F-4Es began {{three days after}} <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> first arrived at Amberley. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> were initially operated as a pool controlled by No.82 Wing (the parent headquarters for No.1 and No.6 Squadrons) and were allocated between the two squadrons only after all the Phantoms, aircrew and ground crew had arrived in Australia. The training program gradually increased in complexity, with night flying beginning in October, practice-bombing sorties commencing in late November and air-to-air sorties being flown from January 1971. Ground attack missions were practiced from February 1971, and in June that year the Phantoms began dropping live bombs during exercises. The introduction of several of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> into service was delayed by an initial shortage of spare parts, but all were operational {{by the end of}} 1970.|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{interaction of}} two model tilrotors in helicopter-mode formation flight is investigated. Three cenarios representing tandem level flight, tandem operations near the ground, {{and a single}} tiltrotor operating above thc ground for varying winds are examined. <b>The</b> effect of <b>aircraft</b> separation distance on the thrust and rolling moment of <b>the</b> trailing <b>aircraft</b> with and without {{the presence of a}} ground plane are quantified. Without a ground plane, <b>the</b> downwind <b>aircraft</b> experiences a peak rolling moment when the right (left) roto- of <b>the</b> upwind <b>aircraft</b> is laterally aligned with the left (right) rotor of <b>the</b> downwind <b>aircraft.</b> <b>The</b> presence of the ground plane causes the peak rolling moment on <b>the</b> downwind <b>aircraft</b> to occur when <b>the</b> upwind <b>aircraft</b> is further outboard of <b>the</b> downwind <b>aircraft.</b> Ground plane surface flow visualization images obtained using rufts and oil are used to understand mutual interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>aircraft.</b> These data provide guidance in determining tiltrotor flight formations which minimize disturbance to <b>the</b> trailing <b>aircraft...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of an aircraft’s {{positioning}} in aviation during two flight tests are presented. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> position was established using GPS data with a sample rate of 1 s in both experiments. The raw GPS data were collected by a Topcon Hiper Pro receiver, which was installed in the pilot’s cabin of a Cessna <b>aircraft.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> coordinates in <b>the</b> BLh geodetic frame were determined using the single point positioning (SPP) method in gLAB software. The mathematical algorithm for <b>the</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> coordinates are also described in the article. The typical standard deviations for <b>the</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> coordinates were less than 10 m in test I and less than 30 m in test II...|$|R
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E

5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su-27M to senior defence and government officials. With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> as Su-35. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> thereafter flew in Berlin and Paris, and would be a regular feature at Moscow's MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|Drukair {{became the}} launch {{customer}} for the Avro RJX-85 in April 2000 when it placed an order with BAE Systems for two aircraft, with deliveries initially {{scheduled to take}} place in November 2001 and January 2002. Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair to after April 2002. BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002, due to receiving orders from only two airlines, Drukair and British European. With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems, <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> manufacturer offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair, although airline management decided against acquiring <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> citing potential problems with sourcing spare parts for <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> in future.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{layout and}} size of the final Yak-44E design was {{similar to that of the}} Grumman E-2C which {{operated}} in the same role from American aircraft carriers, being a twin-engined high-wing monoplane with a rotating radar dome (rotodome) above <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> fuselage. <b>The</b> Yak-44 was designed to carry much more fuel, and was therefore far heavier. The engines were to be two Progress D-27 propfans rated at 14,000 ehp (10,290 kW) each, driving contra-rotating propellers. The crew of five were to be accommodated in a pressurized fuselage, while <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> rotodome, carrying a NPO Vega pulse-doppler radar could be retracted to reduce <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> height when stowed below decks in the carrier's hangar. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft's</b> wings also folded upwards, while a twin tail was fitted.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Committee {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> {{hydraulic}} system A had failed during the flight.
