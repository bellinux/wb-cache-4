5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a <b>tin</b> <b>cup</b> tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Matthews further relates {{that when}} one Lieutenant in the {{regiment}} realized that the captured Federal ambulance contained a 10-gallon keg of whiskey, he immediately sent soldiers back to guard it until it could be safely removed. Once the 33rd had finished fortifying its position, the whiskey was doled out {{at the rate of}} one gill per man, measured in a <b>tin</b> <b>cup.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tim Minear and Joss Whedon {{pointed out}} two scenes that, they believed, {{articulated}} {{the mood of}} the show exceptionally clearly. One scene is in the original pilot [...] "Serenity", when Mal is eating with chopsticks and a Western <b>tin</b> <b>cup</b> is by his plate; the other is in [...] "The Train Job" [...] pilot, when Mal is thrown out of a holographic bar window. The DVD set's [...] "making-of" [...] documentary explains the distinctive frontispiece of the series (wherein Serenity soars over a herd of horses) as Whedon's attempt to capture [...] "everything you need to understand about the series in five seconds".|$|E
2500|$|He had the soldier's hat, {{the worn}} knapsack, the dented canteen. But when Darius Cobb {{set out in}} the 1870s to make a still-life {{lithograph}} of Civil War artifacts, he was missing one important element - a <b>tin</b> <b>cup.</b> So, tacked onto the wall in the trompe-l'œil rendering is a scrap of paper with a sketched outline and the words [...] "Dipper Missing".

2500|$|During {{these years}} in Yosemite, Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no {{prospects}} for a career, and had [...] "periods of anguish," [...] writes naturalist author John Tallmadge. He was sustained by the natural environment and by reading the essays of naturalist author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote about the very life that Muir was then living. On excursions into the back country of Yosemite, he traveled alone, carrying [...] "only a <b>tin</b> <b>cup,</b> a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, {{and a copy of}} Emerson." [...] He usually spent his evenings sitting by a campfire in his overcoat, reading Emerson under the stars. As the years passed, he became a [...] "fixture in the valley," [...] respected for his knowledge of natural history, his skill as a guide, and his vivid storytelling. Visitors to the valley often included scientists, artists, and celebrities, many of whom made a point of meeting with Muir.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{a moment}} to be lost, Robin," [...] said Sam Shipton hurriedly, as {{he led the way}} back to the tavern, where old Meerta and blind Bungo, aided by Letta, had already cleared away all {{evidence}} of the late feast, leaving only three <b>tin</b> <b>cups</b> and three pewter plates on the table, with viands appropriate thereto.|$|R
60|$|The opening was rudely {{furnished}} {{with a heavy}} table and a bench, and close to one wall was a box bed, still filled with pine boughs. On a big wooden hook hung a man's coat, so decayed that it began to fall apart when they touched it. The table contained several <b>tin</b> <b>cups</b> and plates, all rust eaten.|$|R

60|$|So we {{went over}} to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and <b>tin</b> <b>cups,</b> and the nigger was set back considerable, because he {{reckoned}} it was all done with witchcraft.

60|$|There {{were several}} relics lying about: two boots shriveled by fire, a <b>tin</b> <b>cup</b> {{flattened}} by some weight {{that had fallen}} on it, a pistol with its stock blackened by fire. He called the men to the spot.|$|E

50|$|Probably about 1790 {{at the age}} of 15, Isaac {{began his}} {{apprentice}} training in the metalworking trades. As president, Jefferson took Isaac as part of his household to Philadelphia.

6000|$|I {{met her at}} the station, and for {{ten days}} we lived the most idyllic, yet luxurious life beside that singing stream. We rode the trails, we fished, we {{gathered}} wild flowers.
