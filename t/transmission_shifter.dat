25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> included a storage compartment and a tachometer. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille {{that could be made}} functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 and 1969 Buick {{offered the}} GS 400 in a {{convertible}} and hardtop model. [...] Standard {{issue of the}} GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350hp stage 1 [...] ) and 440ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( [...] limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C [...] ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydramatic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic <b>transmission)</b> <b>shifter</b> and linkage, located on a center console. [...] A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually [...] "low" [...] 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard 3 spd or optional 4 spd manual gearbox was also available. [...] Compression ratio on this engine was a very sensible 10.25:1, which allowed {{for the use of}} any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. [...] The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. [...] The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was fake, although it could perhaps technically be called functional, as it could have bettered the air flow available to the climate control system.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the Marauder resembled the 2002 concept vehicle's approach with a center console <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter,</b> but the simulated wood trim was replaced by simulated satin aluminum trim. The instrument panel featured satin aluminum finished gauges along with a tachometer and a 140 mph speedometer (the latter shared with the Crown Victoria P71); to accommodate the tachometer, the voltmeter and oil-pressure gauges were relocated forward of the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|E

50|$|Regular clutch hand Shifter - This {{is where}} the shifter is a regular knob either located on the tank, which {{operates}} through a linkage to the <b>transmission</b> (tank <b>shifter)</b> or on a lever bolted directly {{to the top of}} the <b>transmission</b> (jockey <b>shifter</b> or slap shifter depending on the transmission design) and involves the semi-complex task of foot clutch operation and hand shifting. The foot is used to operate the clutch pedal clutch lever and the second hand is used to shift gears.|$|R
50|$|For {{models with}} the <b>transmission,</b> Thumb <b>shifter</b> is {{selected}} for the shift lever. Simple structure operates with the thumb. Being partly away from the mainstream of modern sports bicycle, push bar type mechanical shift.|$|R
5000|$|... 1987: On D-type, <b>Transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> {{moved from}} the column to the floor. Front bucket seats instead of bench seats.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical changes {{included}} {{relocation of}} the manual <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> to the steering column, new ball joints, {{and a new}} gear-reduction starter motor.|$|E
50|$|Terrain Management {{includes}} four selectable modes. Each mode is selected via a rotary control dial {{on the center}} console, aft of the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|E

50|$|In September 1957, the 503's {{drivetrain}} was revised. The gearbox was {{bolted to}} the <b>transmission</b> and the <b>shifter</b> was moved from the steering column to the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The GT-S was {{powered by}} the 2ZZ-GE engine rated at [...] at 7600 rpm and 133 lbft Nm torque at 6800 rpm. The engine {{featured}} Toyota’s VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift control with intelligence). A second stage valve lift control for intake {{was added to the}} variable intake cam phase timing. Variants of this engine were offered in the Matrix XRS, Corolla XRS and the Lotus Elise (with a Lotus ECU which added 10 bhp). Buyers had the option of a four-speed automatic with shift buttons on the steering wheel, or a six-speed manual. The base tire size was 205/55/15 but the optional size offered was 205/50/16. The tire upgrade was merely [...] so most GT-S models had the optional wheels and tires. All GT-S models had four-wheel disc brakes and metal pedals. Manual <b>transmission</b> <b>shifters</b> and all steering wheels were upgraded to leather. Liftback cargo covers were standard along with fog lights for models without the [...] "Action Package".|$|R
5000|$|... 1948 - Manual <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> now {{mounted on}} column instead of floor. Serial numbers codes: FP ½ ton, FR ¾ ton, & FS 1 ton.|$|E
50|$|Departures {{from the}} {{non-traditional}} interior {{design of the}} E65 include the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> being relocated to the centre console (previously a stalk on the steering column) and the seat controls being relocated to the outside edge of the seat base (previously located in the centre console).|$|E
5000|$|The Opa was {{the result}} of the V50 series Vista Ardeo wagon {{modified}} into a 5-door hatchback. The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> was relocated from the floor between the front seats to a location on the lower portion of the dashboard, allowing passengers to walk to the rear area from either front seat.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Hurst <b>transmission</b> <b>shifters</b> and other {{products}} had become legendary in auto racing, particularly in drag racing, and among custom car makers. Many automobile enthusiasts replaced flimsy factory shifters (and steering column shifters, as well) with Hurst floor shifters to obtain better control of gear selection, particularly for competitive driving. As automotive historian Mike Mueller noted, [...] "If you didn't have a Hurst shifter in your supercar, you were a mild-mannered loser." [...] General Motors' official policy {{up to that time}} had prohibited the use of the names of outside vendors on GM products. Pontiac Division manager Elliot [...] "Pete" [...] Estes convinced the corporation that having the Hurst name on its cars' shifters would be an effective sales tool. Various Pontiac models had already been equipped with Hurst shifters from the factory, but the Hurst name did not actually appear on Pontiac shifters until 1965. Hurst's shifters were so good that U.S. automakers were forced to offer Hurst branded gear sticks on their muscle car models, although at the time they preferred manufacturing their own parts rather than outsourcing.|$|R
5000|$|Because the shifter {{and parking}} brake cannot be mounted between the seats, the <b>transmission</b> {{selector}} or <b>shifter</b> is {{moved to the}} steering column, and the emergency brake is activated by a pedal in the driver's footwell.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{engine was}} aluminium-block {{overhead}} valve [...] ZMZ-24D inline-four producing [...] with one twin-choke carburetor. Only a four-speed manual <b>transmission</b> with floor-mounted <b>shifter</b> was offered (though GAZ did prototype an automatic, a column-shift manual, and a three-speed manual with overdrive).|$|R
50|$|Major {{changes were}} made to the {{dashboard}} with new instruments, touch switches mounted either side controlling wipers, rear window demister, electric antenna (Berlina/Calais), and the headlight switch moved from the right-hand dash side to the indicator stalk. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning control graphics changed slightly, the center console offered more storage with new <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> and surround.|$|E
5000|$|A {{series of}} prototypes {{followed}} that incorporated {{many of the}} improvements from the [...] "surviews" [...] that included roll-up glass side windows, a more powerful engine, and a column-mounted <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> with bench seat (rather than bucket-type seats with floor shift fitted in the concept car). The model was named NKI (for Nash-Kelvinator International), and it featured revised styling incorporating a hood blister and rear wheel cutouts.|$|E
50|$|On the inside, changes {{included}} a floor-mounted automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter,</b> {{in place of}} the column shifter, as well as a redesigned center stack containing audio and climate controls. Climate control is automatic on all models except the XLS. The Limited model also featured full color-coded bumpers, wheel arches and side moldings, as well as side mirrors with integrated LED indicators. Rear drum brakes have been replaced by disc brakes all round.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 {{model year}} TSX added an {{optional}} 3.5L 280 hp V6 engine, {{shared with the}} Acura TL. It comes standard with the five-speed automatic <b>transmission</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> and 18-inch alloy wheels, and is available in either Premium or Technology trims.|$|R
50|$|In Singapore, the car {{was called}} the Cerato Forte, and was offered with the same 1.6-liter Gamma and 2.0-liter Theta II engine {{variants}} as in Malaysia. It featured a four-speed automatic transmission at launch, and then received a six-speed automatic <b>transmission</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> after the 2011 facelift.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: One type of manumatic {{shifting}} system {{available on}} automatic <b>transmissions</b> are paddle <b>shifters.</b> The paddle depicted {{here is the}} upshift paddle in a 2013 Honda Accord, with the driver's hand on it. Manumatics and paddle shifters may control any type of automatic transmission, including the continuously variable transmission in the Accord.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow Fever - 500 produced, {{painted in}} Solar Yellow {{exterior}} paint and black [...] "fanged" [...] stripe {{on top of}} hood, came with two-tone interior which featured a yellow center stack bezel, yellow door spears, yellow stitching on steering wheel, seats and Regular Cab manual <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> and yellow embroidering on the SRT-10 floor mats. Also came with special Yellow Fever Edition badges and a serialized Yellow Fever dash plaque. Available as a 2005 model.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Escape and Tribute were {{refreshed}} in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The {{base engine}} became the Mazda 2.3 L MZR 4 with 153 PS (114 kW)/206 N·m (152 lb·ft), {{and the top}} remained the 3.0 L Duratec V6, now with torque down to 261 N·m (193 lb·ft). In North American-built models, a floor-mounted automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006 model year ...|$|E

50|$|All models came as {{standard}} with a five speed manual transmission, {{except for the}} Stop & Start model, which came with the SensoDrive gearbox, a five speed semi-automatic <b>transmission</b> with paddle <b>shifters</b> and manual and automatic modes. The top level was the only version that {{had the option of}} a four speed fully automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, SSC North America {{announced}} {{they were going}} to produce a limited number of SSC Ultimate Aero XT's. This vehicle was an upgraded Ultimate Aero and included many features from the Tuatara. These features include a 1,300 horsepower version of the Tuatara twin-turbo charged V8, a 7-speed Tuatara paddle <b>shifter</b> <b>transmission,</b> and upgrade cooling, fuel, and braking systems.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a limited}} (450 units) version of 2012 MX-5 Miata with black-only Power Retractable Hard Top, two new body (non-roof) colours, new 17-inch black {{gunmetal}} alloy wheels, black exterior accents, black heated leather seats and piano black interior finishes, six-speed manual <b>transmission</b> with short-throw <b>shifter</b> or six-speed Sport automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, Premium and Suspension packages.|$|R
5000|$|A {{deliberate}} {{effort was}} made to give the car a more [...] "European" [...] flavor than the Mustang, at least to American buyers' eyes, drawing inspiration from the popular Jaguar E-Type. Aside from the base model and the luxurious XR-7, only one performance package was available for either model: the sporty GT. The XR-7 model brought a simulated wood-grained dashboard with a full set of black-faced competition instruments and toggle switches, an overhead console, a T-type center automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter</b> (if equipped with the optional Merc-O-Matic transmission), and leather-vinyl upholstery.|$|E
5000|$|The first-generation Bighorn was {{available}} as a three- or five-door wagon with independent front suspension. In the Japanese market, the car was originally introduced as the [...] "Isuzu Rodeo Bighorn", but the [...] "Rodeo" [...] part of the name was soon dropped. Early engines included a 2.0-liter gasoline and a [...] 2.2-liter diesel, lightly powered even by early 1980s standards for the vehicles 3700 lb empty weight. The four-wheel-drive system was engaged by operating a three-position shifter adjacent to the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter.</b> Both Aisin manual-locking and Isuzus own auto-locking hubs were employed.|$|E
50|$|On the inside, changes {{included}} a new floor mounted automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifter,</b> {{in place of}} the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new radio and automatic climate control with digital read-out, on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the 4-cylinder has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet Euro III emission regulations.|$|E
50|$|The 2016 Concept GLA45 AMG with an AMG 2.0-litre four-cylinder {{twin-scroll}} turbocharged {{petrol engine}} rated 280 kW; 381 hp and 475 N·m, 4Matic all wheel drive, AMG Speedshift DCT 7-speed <b>transmission</b> with paddle <b>shifters,</b> and fitted with various AMG-badged accoutrements and an AMG sports exhaust system with an electronically controlled variable vane system to modulate the exhaust note.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the period}} when U.S. cars usually had only three forward speeds and the {{steering}} column {{was the most common}} shifter location, this layout was sometimes called [...] "three on the tree".In contrast European cars and performance cars mostly used a four-speed <b>transmission</b> with floor-mounted <b>shifters.</b> This layout was then referred to as [...] "four on the floor".|$|R
2500|$|Chrysler {{increased}} {{the displacement of}} its highest-performance small block V-8 engine from [...] to [...] for 1974. The 360 was rated at [...] {{and placed in the}} Duster 360. However, the 1974 Duster was nearly [...] heavier than the 1971 model on account of the heavier bumpers, side-impact door beams, emission control equipment, and added soundproofing. Even with performance options such as the four-speed manual <b>transmission,</b> Hurst <b>shifter</b> and Sure-Grip differential with 3.55:1 axle ratio, 0–60mph and quarter-mile times increased roughly two seconds compared to those for the 1970 Duster. Unfortunately, higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high performance waned.|$|R
