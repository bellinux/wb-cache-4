40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of magnetic fields in recent five decades, the health effects of nonionized electromagnetic radiation is an important investigation subject. While the magnetic field is well known, it is difficult to investigate the health effects of radiation, because of the complex metabolism of human body. However, by the experimental and <b>theorical</b> <b>studies,</b> a lot of significant health effects of magnetic fields have been discovered. But, there are probabilities that can have much more adverse health effects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of 50 Hz- 1 mT magnetic field on human median motor nerve conduction parameters. At this frequency, 1 mT value of magnetic field intensity is known and accepted as the marginal value where biological interaction starts. Standard nerve conduction techniques using constant measured distances were applied to evaluate the median nerve. Consequently in the measures conducted using the device of 4 channel NCS/EMG/ EPS there was a significant decrease in motor distal amplitude after the magnetic field application in comparison to the one during the application (p= 0, 000573) and also in the motor distal amplitude/ proximal amplitude in comparison to the ones before the application (p= 0, 037418) ...|$|R
40|$|Single walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWCNT) {{are observed}} {{to have high}} flexibility, strength and stiffness, {{very similar to those}} of individual graphene sheets. Eventhough direct measurements of such mechanical properties are difficult to perform due to the nanosize involved; along with the developments in instrumentation, production, processing and manipulation techniques, the measurements of the elastic moduli of carbon nanotubes has become possible. On the other hand, this extreme small size is very suitable for performing atomistic simulations. Both the experimental and <b>theorical</b> <b>studies</b> have shown that SWCNTs, and SWCNT ropes are promising low weight, high strength fibers for use as reinforcing element in composite materials. It is also predicted that SWCNT´s can sustain large strains in the axial directions. With this motivation, we have studied the elastic properties of carbon nanotubes under tensile loading and found the Young´s modulus, tensile strength, Poisson ratio and frequency of vibration. In particular, we simulated a (10 x 10) SWCNT consisting of 400 atoms with 20 layers under tensile loading using our developed O(N) parallel TBMD algorithms [1], [2], [3] from the works of [4],[5].

40|$|Meat {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the consumption pattern of most European and North American consumers. Meat production is responsible for a well known environmental pressure due to the inefficient conversion of plant protein to meat protein and alternatives sources, such as insects or algae, will be rapidly required. In a recent <b>theorical</b> <b>study,</b> de Boer et al. (2013) show that consumers prefer to eat a hybrid meat product (i. e. a mix of meat and its substitute) rather than a pure meat substitute [3]. Based on these preliminary results, hedonic tests were realized to assess the acceptability of insect-based burgers in a target population composed of people from 15 to 25 years old, considered as the future insect consumers. Isolated in a tasting booth, each participant was invited to taste four burger samples containing a ratio of 20 gr of protein by 100 gr of burger. The first burger was prepared with 95 % of grounded beef (1), the second with 95 % of green lentil (2), the third with 45 % of green lentil and 50 % of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.; Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) and the fourth with 45 % of grounded beef burger and 50 % of mealworms. The last 5 % of each burger consists of an aromatization portion containing onions, carrots, tomato paste and garlic. Participants were asked to rate each sample on a 9 -point hedonic scale, where extreme sides were noted from “extremely dislike” (left) to “extremely like” (right). Tukey post-hoc comparisons on the appreciation results showed that beef-based products (with or without mealworms) were relatively preferred to lentil-based products (with or without mealworms), probably because hybrid meat burgers seem more familiar to the consumers than vegetable burgers, and that no liking differences were noticed between the two beef-based burgers and between the two insect-based burgers. These results confirm that shape and appearance are key criteria in the acceptation of meat substitute by non-vegetarian consumers and that insects will preferentially be consumed, in the future, if they are presented in an invisible way and associated with familiar flavors.

This is a Thesis submitted for the Master Programme of Islamic Thought and Islamic Jurisprudence Department, at the University of Muhammadiyah Surakarta. Prepared by: Tamim Aziz, supervised by Dr. Muhammad Muinudinillah Basri. and Dr. Mochammad Ichsan. In 2012 AD - 1433 H. The notion of this qualitative and librarical research is basically urged by the realitiy of da'wah {{which has been in}} need of certain guidelines dealing with the alteration of evil under the rule of Islamic Juris prudence, "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful. " Among the reasons of the critical need of this study is the emergence of the undesirable phenomenon in the arena of da'wah, that is hasty enthusiasm {{in the way of the}} alteration of evil; neglecting the negative results of the actions and and losses. The study then raises two important questions as follows: (1) What does the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful" mean? And What does the {{guidelines of}} the alteration of evil mean as well as their relationship between each other? (2) What kinds of guidelines could be derived from the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful" for the purpose of the alteration of evil? After intensive studies in each of the two fields of the Islamic jurisprudences, pertaining to the rule "there is no harm nor inflicting harmful", and making the comparison between the two subjects as well as looking at their relationships between each other, finally the study came up with a set of the rules related to the alteration of the evil. These rules are: firstly - the general rule in the alteration of evil, which is keeping and making the interests come true, and refuting and neglecting the harms. Secondly – the rules that are derived from the rule of keeping and making the interests come true and refuting and neglecting the harms lead to some important results: (1) the correct perception of the concept of evil, and the Islamic jurisprudence related to the alteration of evil. (2) identification and verification before proceeding the alteration of evil. (3) starting from the worst of the evil. (4) calling to goodness and preventing from badness before denying and alteration of evil (5) choosing lesser of two evils. (6) the alteration of evil should not entail greater evil. These rules presumably could light up the path of da'i in the field of da'wah and direct their genuine concern on the alteration of evil toward the correct way for the sake of refuting the harm and keeping the interest. ...|$|E

The range of ideas aiming to conform island medical Faculties to the progress of science, gave life to the critique of a teaching model, still ruled by the Galenic authority and by metaphysical etiological explanations, which ignored the physiological and pathological reality revealed by the anatomical study methodically on performed corpses. The new programme of studies admitted the teaching of surgery, which had completely disappeared in the university ruled by Jesuites, and increased the value of anatomy teaching, that will be chosen as a subject for the speech made during the solemn opening of the medical Faculty of Sassari in 1765.

Parte do pressuposto de que a corporeidade não é algo complementar mas um fundamento impreterível para o conhecimento e a prática educacional. Daí a questão central do trabalho: o corpo tem sua linguagem? Como se caracteriza? Como essa linguagem pode contribuir para a educação escolar? Em busca de resposta, a pesquisa inicia sua trajetória mostrando os vários olhares a respeito do corpo desde a antiguidade até os dias atuais, buscando nas várias áreas do conhecimento, a filosofia, a biologia, a neurologia, a psicologia, a antropologia e a educação uma parceria para fundamentar este trabalho. Definimos em seguida o que é linguagem, como ela surgiu entre os seres humanos e conceituamos linguagem {{corporal}}. A tarefa de ligar linguagem corporal e educação, dada a ausência de trabalhos que estabelecem esse elo ou focalizam a utilização da linguagem corporal na educação escolar, exigiu uma sondagem em um espaço limitado do Ensino Fundamental I buscando olhar as experiências embrionárias que aí acontecem e seus limites. Enfim, propusemos a partir dos estudos teóricos sobre corpo, corporeidade e linguagem corporal, subsídios para os professores lidarem com essa linguagem na prática pedagógica.

At the time of writing, the only relevant studies on the topic are about VAWT in skewed flow. There is lack of experimental, numerical or <b>theorical</b> <b>studies</b> about floating turbines. In the following paper, the aerodynamic performance of a periodically oscillating VAWT is investigated through theorical and computational means. The complex dynamics of a floating turbine was simplified to a sinusoidal pitch motion, assuring simplicity without losing meaningfullness. A theory is given to predict the aerodynamic torque of an oscillating VAWT, obtaining it from {{the one of the}} same fixed axis turbine. A blade-element model was developed to achieve this result, taking into account the effect of oscillation on key parameters affecting the torque, that is angles of attack and relative wind speed. The core idea of the method, is to use blade element theory not as a prediction itself, but as a mean to correct the aerodynamic torque of the fixed axis turbine. The latter {{may be the result of}} both experiments, or numerical simulations. The simplest though most effective correction developed is To=Tf (1 −k cos(ωot)) 2, (1) where ωo is the frequency of oscillation in rad/s, and k is the ratio of the maximum oscillation speed for a certain section of the turbine over the freestream wind speed. Three different corrective functions were evaluated, that is one for the effect of the angles of attack, one for the relative wind speed and one considering both at the same time (Eq. (1)). Moreover, the correction may depend on just one representative section, the middle one in this case, or the entire rotor. Theorical predictions were compared against data from CFD simulations, for two different oscillation frequencies. These were chosen in the typical range of wave energy spectrum, in order to test representative conditions for floating applications. CFD simulations were also performed to obtain the torque of the fixed axis turbine, which was validated against experimental data from the 17 m Darrieus-type rotor studied by SANDIA laboratories. CFD simulations showed aerodynamic forces are deeply affected by oscillation. As intuition suggests, torque increases when the turbine pitches in the opposite direction of the wind, and decreases when it pitches in the same direction. This periodic oscillation causes significative ripple and maximum torque increase. For the higher oscillation frequency, which represents the most extreme condition, maximum torque was about 2 times the one of the fixed turbine.

Numerical simulations showed aerodynamic forces are deeply affected by oscillation. As intuition suggests, torque increases when the turbine pitches in the opposite direction of the wind, and decreases when it pitches in the same direction. This periodic oscillation causes significant ripple and maximum torque increase. For the higher oscillation frequency, which represents the most extreme condition, maximum torque was more than 2 times the one of the fixed turbine. Mean torque was found to be almost unaffected or slightly increased. For the higher oscillation frequency a 4. 4 % increase was observed. The theorical model was able to reproduce the behaviour of the oscillating turbine with satisfactory accuracy. To quantify the matching, absolute error was divided by the peak torque of the fixed axis turbine. For the lower oscillation frequency worst accuracy is 13. 8 %, while mean accuracy is 5. 3 %. As the frequency grows the hypothesis which the model is based on become less valid, so for the higher oscillation frequency precision decreases, in fact worst accuracy is 29. 0 % while mean is 9. 1 %. The theory proved to attain reasonably accurate results notwithstanding its simplicity, making it a cost-effective tool for quick analysis or optimization. Moreover, the theory could insight the way in which oscillation affects the torque. Considering relative wind speed separately showed that it has little influence, so it can be concluded that torque is affected by oscillation mainly by the change in the angles of attack. By comparing theorical and computational results, it was possible to show the dynamic effect on the downwind blade created by the wake of the upwind passage, a phenomenon which momentum models tailored for floating turbines should take into account. Finally some conclusions are drawn on the advantages and disadvantages of the aerodynamic features of Darrieus type VAWTs...|$|R

Privilegia a pesquisa descritiva e analítica. A pesquisa de campo ocorre num Centro Municipal de Saúde e num Centro de Testagem Anônima de AIDS situados no Rio de Janeiro, que prestam serviços de atendimento ambulatorial e testagem, com ênfase na prevenção. Para o resgate da fala dos atores, foi utilizada a entrevista semi-estruturada. A pesquisa focaliza a ótica dos atores sociais sobre a assistência prestada. A análise do material empírico indica que a qualidade dos serviços prestados pelo programa de DST/AIDS no município é eficiente no que tange aos meios utilizados no desenvolvimento do trabalho. Porém, em relação aos recursos humanos e materiais ocorrem limitações para o alcance da eficácia e ter um impacto mais efetivo, do ponto de vista de mudança de comportamento e controle da epidemia no Município do Rio de Janeiro. Essa problemática aponta para uma reformulação das diretrizes, políticas, técnicas e orçamentárias e, principalmente de canais de comunicação mais eficazes junto à população usuária dos serviços e aos profissionais que desenvolvem atividades do Programa, a fim de ouvir e discutir suas demandas, o que incidirá numa contribuição para o encaminhamento do programa.
