40|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety (OHS) is under-researched in the {{sociology}} of work and employment. This deficit is most pronounced for white-collar occupations. Despite growing awareness {{of the significance of}} psychosocial conditions – notably stress – and musculoskeletal disorders, white-collar work is considered by conventional OHS discourse to be ‘safe’. This study’s locus is clerical processing in the UK public sector, specifically Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, in the context of efficiency savings programmes. The key initiative was lean working, which involved redesigned workflow, task fragmentation, standardization and individual targets. Utilizing a holistic model of white-collar OHS and in-depth quantitative and qualitative data, the evidence of widespread self-reported ill-health symptoms is compelling. Statistical tests of association demonstrate that the <b>transformed</b> <b>work</b> organization that accompanied lean working contributed most to employees’, particularly women’s, ill-health complaint...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{technology}} and the information and communication services supported by it have become increasingly embedded in, {{and in some cases}} <b>transformed,</b> <b>work</b> and social activity and created new challenges for studying information systems. This paper focuses on the experience with mobile technology in an inherently mobile and information intensive work activity - policing. Drawing upon data from this context this paper makes two key sets of contributions. Empirically, we illuminate the congruencies and contradictions between mobile {{technology and}} mobile working, and the relationship between the two, revealing a state of change based upon dialectic interaction. We highlight several ways in which mobile technology has changed the nature of mobile work activity. Theoretically we advance the use of activity theory to better understand the changes of mobile technology mediated work. We extend traditional use of activity theory by adopting congruencies as an analytical lens, in addition to the approach of examining contradictions. The findings are applicable to other areas of mobile work and contribute to the body of knowledge concerning mobile technology mediated work...|$|E

40|$|Geguritan Sucita, a {{literary}} work composed by Ida Ketut Jlantik (1905 - 1961), is a <b>transformed</b> <b>work</b> from Old-Javanese religious text, {{which has been}} very popularly spread to the community of anak nyastra ‘the devotees of Balinese traditional letters’. The words chosen are composed {{in accordance with the}} alamkara style and on the basis of arrangement called padalingsa. Based on the analysis of alamkara ‘stylistic’, it can be found out that Geguritan Sucita has a complete and beautiful arthalamkara ‘figure of speech’ in which there are sixteen different kinds. Among those 16 kinds of figure of speech, the rupaka ‘comparison, metaphor’ is the dominant style to be utilized. It conforms to the goal of Jlantik in composing Geguritan Sucita, that is, to transform the religious values of Hinduism. The religious values, particularly its aspects of divinity, are transcendent. Because {{of the fact that it}} is very difficult to elucidate, therefore, Jlantik applies the rupaka style much more than the others, because of being very effective to turn the religious concepts that is abstract to become concrete.

40|$|The {{industrialization}} {{of developing}} countries has fundamentally <b>transformed</b> <b>work,</b> employment, and labor for millions. Despite the industrialization {{of most of the}} developing world, we present evidence that Latin America has experienced stagnating industrial employment in the past few decades. Benefiting from recently available data on industrial employment as a percentage of total employment from 1980 through 2006, we analyze fixed-effects models for 20 Latin American countries. Specifically, we examine three theoretical explanations: productivity/comparative advantage, institutionalism, and dependency/world-systems. Our analyses demonstrate that the prevailing productivity/comparative advantage explanation has limited value. By contrast, we find supportive evidence for a combination of institutional and dependency/world-systems variables. In particular, the stagnating industrial employment share in Latin American countries has been driven by the negative effects of (in order of magnitude) the Mercosur trade agreement, mineral and ore exports (as a percentage of total exports), the duration of the current political regime, military spending (as a percentage of GDP), and inward foreign direct investment flows (as a percentage of GDP). © The Author(s) 2011...|$|E
40|$|A guiding {{principle}} for the South African public service {{is that of}} service to people. In terms of Section 11. 1 of the White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service meeting basic needs through service delivery {{should be addressed by}} providing the necessary infrastructural support to open up previously suppressed economic and human potential in both urban and rural areas. This in turn will lead to community empowerment and increased outputs in all the sectors of the economy. The Batho Pele White Paper requires that all users of public services be consulted regarding their needs, priorities and standard of services required. This means that public managers will have to transform their management functions to accommodate the requirements of the Batho Pele White Paper. The members of the public should be accepted as customers, meaning that a position in the public service implies that the occupant is a public servant, rather than merely a public official. This paper will provide an overview of the methods to increase employee commitment and productivity through the identification of the barriers towards effective information flow.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years we have {{witnessed}} an exponential growth in terms of networked computers and internet usage. This has led to the seamless fabric of interconnected computing and storage systems, mobile devices, software, wired and wireless networks, and related technologies. This pervasive, cost effective communication has enabled vast, constant flow of information that has <b>transformed</b> <b>work</b> environments and processes in nearly all walks of life, from government to business to research. While this trend is a welcome addition with new applications and services proliferating daily, it has spawn numerous security problems which, are threatening to wipe out all the growth achieved. These security threats have had major cost impact such as lower employee productivity, drain network resources, create financial losses and increase legal liability risks. In this paper we discuss existing and emerging security threats. We then show that unless purposeful measures are taken such as encouraging businesses to invest more in security, educate users and come up with new paradigms of solving these and emerging security problems all gains of interconnectivity will be wiped out. Solutions for mitigating current security threats are discussed and we extend the threat modelling process to address security challenges posed by internal users...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{exploring}} the linkages between standardizing aspects of global information infrastructures and professional identity. In doing so, {{this paper adopts}} Beck and Giddens ’ theory of ‘reflexive modernization ’ to analyze how {{the introduction of a}} global information infrastructure (the GIS) in a Maritime Classification Company (MCC) <b>transformed</b> <b>work</b> practices and professional identity of ship surveyors. The analysis of the MCC case suggests that tensions between the professional identity of surveyors {{and the ways in which}} the GIS infrastructure standardized local practices introduced new risks and ‘radical doubt ’ in surveyors’ work. As a consequence, surveyors strive to re-construct their professional identity and establish new systems of trust to accommodate risk and the standardizing aspects of the GIS infrastructure. While these unanticipated transformations lead to innovative new ways of working through users ’ improvisations and reskilling, it also undermined some of the initially envisioned organizational transformations. Thus, risks do not stem from poor design or lack of strategic alignment, but are rather reflexively produced and diffused through use and management of the technology itself. The paper concludes by giving some implications for theorizing information infrastructures and for the practice The potential for advanced information and communication technologies to enable globally distributed work and global business strategies as well as improving control and coordination, is widely acknowledged in the Information Systems literature (e. g...|$|E

40|$|As {{communications}} technologies {{become increasingly}} stable and secure, distributed virtual work {{is fast becoming}} a central component of how global organizations function (Caya, Mortensen & Pissoneault, 2013; Gibson, Huang, Kirkman & Shapiro, 2014). With U. S. virtual worker growth of over 100 % {{in the past decade}} (Global Workplace Analytics, 2014) and an estimated 1. 3 billion virtual workers worldwide (International Data Corporation, 2011), it is increasingly important for organizations and employees to effectively navigate this <b>transformed</b> <b>work</b> environment. Although work {{is becoming more and more}} virtual, our collective understanding of the effects of this change is still in its infancy. In a variety of articles across a range of domains, Organizational Behavior scholars have lamented the lack of clarity on whether existing, highly cited management theories wholly apply to virtual contexts (Bolino, Long & Turnley, 2015; Feldman & Ng, 2007; Grandey, 2015). Theories relating to interpersonal interactions, which often rely on synchronous communication, in person cues, and shared understandings, may operate differently in settings where individuals are separated by space, time, and technology. The goal of this symposium is to advance research on virtual work by illuminating new findings and theoretical developments within this emerging work context. The presentations in this symposium cross domains and methodologies to help build an understanding of how virtual work impacts employee status, voice, transactive memory, team creativity, and communication. Together, these presentations propose theories and offer practical implications that will advance our understanding of this increasingly popular business context...|$|E
40|$|The {{most visible}} impacts of new {{communicative}} technologies {{are in the}} attention-grabbing and expressive potential of greater design control at the desktop, hypertext, and multimedia (graphics, animation, video, sound, hap-tics, and ultimately immersive virtual and augmented reality). Nonetheless, the most significant impacts of new communicative technologies {{are likely to be}} in the changing activities and communities facilitated by new potentials of transmission, storage, and accessibility that change time, space, memory, informational resources, and economy of social encounter. Beyond providing students with facility in design tools and multi-media rhetoric, teachers of rhetoric need to provide students with analytic tools to understand the chang-ing locations and informational richness of encounters they will be creating, the larger knowledge, social, and activity environments that surround the particular encounter and activity spaces they are working in, {{and the ways in which}} communications will mediate <b>transformed</b> <b>work,</b> citizenship, and per-sonal relations. Increasingly, to lead a full and productive life requires learning to navigate, maintain, and constantly reconstruct the built symbolic environ-ment we share with others and which forms the basis of social cooperation in a knowledge society. And a core part of that learning is to understand how that communication, information, and cooperation can support humanly sat-isfying modes of social life. Animals were social before they were communicative. Even coral requires a colony. Animals were social and communicative before they were symbolic; witness ants being led by each other’s pheromones. Animals were social and communicative before they had language; bees dance to direct each other to pollen. Each of these developments in sociality extended the possibilities and range of interaction, cooperation, sharing, and intersubjectivity.
