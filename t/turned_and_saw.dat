25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
25|$|The {{time came}} when {{she chose to}} do a self-{{portrait}}. Again, she took her time working on every detail but the face. Just before the time arrived for her to begin working {{on the face of}} her self-portrait, she fell ill. She was rushed to the infirmary, but they could find nothing wrong with her. She mysteriously died with her portrait unfinished. Not long after her death, the sightings began. Another Sister heard sobbing coming from the room that held the unfinished painting. Curious, the Sister entered the room and saw the back of a nun crying in front of the portrait. When the Sister went to comfort the sobbing nun, she <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> there was nothing but darkness where the woman's face should have been. Sightings persisted time and again from a number of different sources.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown {{were arrested}} in Evanston. As Coleman and Brown walked westward across an intersection, they passed {{immediately}} {{in front of a}} man in a car stopped at the red light who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. He recognized Coleman and drove north to a gas station and notified the police. A description of the two was broadcast to police. As officers entered the area, a detective saw Coleman and Brown sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park, but noted they were wearing different T-shirts. As the detective reported this, two sergeants who were driving by the park heard this, <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Coleman and Brown. As they approached Coleman, the officers observed Brown walking away from Coleman toward the rear of the park. The detective joined the two sergeants and Coleman was approached for questioning; he had no identification and denied he was Alton Coleman. Meanwhile, two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston Police Department, where both were identified by their fingerprints.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she {{lay on her back}} until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E
