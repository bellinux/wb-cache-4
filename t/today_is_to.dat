25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families.

In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{cormorant}} fishing {{has been}} a significant fishing technique in China. To control the birds, the fishermen tie a snare near the base of the bird's throat. This prevents the birds from swallowing larger fish, which are held in their throat. When a cormorant has caught a fish, the fisherman brings the bird back to the boat and has the bird spit the fish out. Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants. Though cormorant fishing used to be a successful fishing industry, its primary use <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> serve the tourism industry. In Guilin, Guangxi Province, cormorant birds are famous for fishing on the shallow Lijiang River.|$|E
25|$|The radical discipleship {{interpretation}} {{asserts that}} the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda {{of the book is}} to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom. The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and <b>today,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values – imperialism, nationalism, and civil religion being the most dangerous and insidious.|$|E

Regional HIAG chapters continued to exist through the 2000s, at least one into the 2010s.

But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox {{that they were a}} bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E
