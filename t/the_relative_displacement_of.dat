He further developed the rotating mirror to measure the speed of electricity in a conductor, photographing the sparks emitted from two conductors, one 1.8 km longer than the other and measuring <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> their images.

Moreover, there were no other monitoring instruments in Owakudani to compare with the GB-InSAR.

5000|$|The working {{principle}} {{for the first}} case is explained by a vertically grown nanowire subjected to the laterally moving tip. When a piezoelectric structure is subjected to the external force by the moving tip, the deformation occurs throughout the structure. The piezoelectric effect will create the electrical field inside the nanostructure; the stretched part with the positive strain will exhibit the positive electrical potential, whereas the compressed part with the negative strain will show the negative electrical potential. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> cations with respect to anions in its crystalline structure. As a result, {{the tip of the}} nanowire will have an electrical potential distribution on its surface, while the bottom of the nanowire is neutralized since it is grounded.

5000|$|According to the {{so-called}} centroid hypothesis, judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of centers-of-masses (centroids) of the luminance profiles of the objects (i.e., the position of centroid of an image determines its perceived location). As suggested by Morgan et al. , visual procedure of centroid extraction is causally related to a certain integration of neural activations (spatial pooling of the positional signals) evoked by the neighboring object parts. Though the integration reduces {{the ability of the}} visual system to determine accurately the mutual position of image elements (i.e., coarsens the positional acuity), such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole, irrespective of its size, the shape complexity, and illumination conditions. Concerning the Müller-Lyer and similar illusions, the pattern of neural excitation evoked by contextual flank (e.g., the Müller-Lyer wings themselves) overlaps with that caused by the stimulus terminator (e.g., the wings apex), thereby leading (due to the shift of the centroid of summed excitation) to its perceptual displacement (these positional changes are apparent in Dynamic Müller-Lyer Illusion by Gianni A. Sarcone, particularly with gaze fixation on any of the terminators). The crucial point in the centroid explanation regarding the positional shifts of the stimulus terminators in direction of the centers-of-masses of contextual flanks was confirmed in psychophysical examination of illusory figures with rotating distractors [...] <b>The</b> <b>relative</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them; that is, the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects. Unlike most other approaches, the centroid explanation is based on a relatively small set of assumptions and is capable of making quantitative predictions that can be immediately and purposefully tested in experiments {{with a wide variety of}} stimuli modifications. This quantitative approach offers not only some general trends, but also reveals a certain [...] "fine structure" [...] of the illusion magnitude changes , what is still unattainable for most of other widely accepted explanations of illusions of extent of the Müller-Lyer type.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>relative</b> {{positions}} between <b>the</b> four {{slide blocks}} {{vary with the}} movement of the table due to the geometric errors of the guide rail.
