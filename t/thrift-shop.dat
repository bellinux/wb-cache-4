[...] 'Rock Steady' itself isn't a terrible song– it's just kind of pointless." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog gave the single a two-star rating, mentioning: [...] " [...] the Saints are acting quite devilishly in pinching approximately 98.3% of their sound, mixing it with the dodgy checkered-trousered leftovers from the Ordinary Boys' Brassbound, and throwing in every single senseless lyric from every single girl band song ever." ...|$|E

The vignettes cover the 1970s and '80s, fashion high and low.|$|E

Club gave the album an A−, saying [...] "Bloom takes what worked before and intensifies it" [...] and {{that with the}} record, [...] "they have mastered their sultry formula". Other reviews of Bloom were more mixed. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press felt that the album did not possess [...] "as many memorable hooks (or as many well-defined song structures)" [...] as the bands previous album, Teen Dream, and that as a result, [...] "the record tends to fade into the background and become something so indistinct that its forgettable, even after multiple listens." [...] Maddy Costa of The Guardian criticized the albums lack of surprises, writing that [...] "nothing happens to shatter the perfect surface, either within individual songs or across the album as a whole, and that might be Blooms problem. Its beautiful, spectral, dreamy, but never makes your pulse quicken." ...|$|E

Bustle states that from his style [...] "to his quirky personality and unique voice, Alexander screams “artsy” and “soul” — exactly what Connick, Jr. a New Orleans' son was looking for in his hometown." [...] As part of his competition on the popular television show the producers, and media have noted his unique dress appearance and style. Scott Borchetta, a record executive and on-air contestant coach stated [...] "Quentin has this really cool New Orleans vibe about him. He has these great piercing eyes. Every time he shows up, everybody always wants to know, 'What is Quentin wearing?' because it's always cool, and it's <b>thrift-shop</b> cool. It's like, 'You got that for what? Where?'" [...] In Bustle, entertainment writer Jessica Molinari noted he [...] "performed the song {{as if he was}} actually casting a spell on the audience, and that’s what made it so amazing. From his outfit (did you see that fur coat?!), to his hair, to his crazy-intense eye contact, Alexander fully immersed himself in his performance and played a character — and that’s what sets him apart as an artist." [...] Show judge Keith Urban stated, when asked [...] "What is it about him that viewers are responding to?", [...] "He's a conceptual artist, with his sense of arrangement, his interpretation, the way he looks." [...] Heavy said he is [...] "revered for his intensity and his fashion risks" [...] on the show.|$|E

Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland was the first to define it, while Courtney Love of Hole was the first to popularize it.
