5|$|Cochet married Germaine Desthieux on 16 April 1926. He <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to {{play tennis}} and later entered minor tournaments together. Apart from playing tennis Cochet was an amateur ice-hockey player. He ran a {{sporting}} goods store in Paris. Cochet was an occasional coach as well and in 1930 he coached the French junior tennis team {{once a week for}} free including his brother-in-law Georges Desthieux who won the New Malden tournament that year. He was awarded the Red Ribbon of the Legion of Honour for his sport merits in 1951. He died on 1 April 1987, aged 85, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|She {{had a short}} {{marriage}} {{characterized by}} abuse and control. A child was born to the couple, but died 11 months later. Before the child's birth, Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce. To support herself, she taught school for a period {{and then began to}} work as a portraitist. She traveled throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862. Because she lived a mobile lifestyle, she had few long-lasting relationships. The closest personal relationship of her life was with her mother. She raised a girl, however, for three years and <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to paint. Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security, but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career.|$|E

5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E
25|$|Stewart's mother <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to {{cook and}} sew. Later, she learned the {{processes}} of canning and preserving when she visited her grandparents' home in Buffalo, New York. Her father had a passion for gardening and passed on much of his knowledge and expertise to his daughter. Stewart was also active in many extracurricular activities, such as the school newspaper and the Art Club.|$|E
25|$|By mid-December 1923, {{primarily}} due to her merits in Down to the Sea in Ships, Bow {{was chosen}} the most successful of the 1924 WAMPAS Baby Stars. Three months before Down to the Sea in Ships was released, Bow danced half nude, on a table, uncredited in Enemies of Women (1923). In spring she got a part in The Daring Years (1923), where she befriended actress Mary Carr, who <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to use make-up.|$|E
50|$|Mbaba Mwana Waresa is a {{fertility}} {{goddess of}} the Zulu religion of Southern Africa. She rules over rainbows, agriculture, harvests, rain, and beer and has power over water and earth. She <b>taught</b> <b>Her</b> people <b>how</b> to sow and reap and also taught them {{the art of}} making beer. It is this act that has made Her {{one of the more}} revered goddesses of the Zulu people.|$|R
25|$|In the Catholic tradition, saints beside Ignatius of Loyola have {{suggested}} prayer and contemplation on scripture as {{a path to}} knowing Christ better. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> nuns <b>how</b> {{to try to get}} to know Christ by using mental prayer. While the Catholic Church supports Christian meditation as beneficial in knowing Christ, in the letter Aspects of Christian meditation it specifically warned against using non-Christian (e.g. modified Buddhist) styles of meditations as an attempt to know Christ.|$|R
2500|$|Because of her age and sex, Esther was {{probably}} adopted into a Wabanaki family, and {{was expected to}} assume the personality, duties and role of a Wabanaki daughter. As <b>her</b> adoptive family <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> to <b>how</b> to live as a Wabanaki girl and to pray as a Catholic, it's possible that they [...] "became attached to this child with an extraordinary affection." [...] After {{only a few months}} with the Wabanaki, Esther had probably shed so much of her former identity that she would have barely been recognized by her English family.|$|R
25|$|Laurette Lesperance {{has also}} lived in Willow Bunch {{her whole life}} and is 82 years old. She went to the convent until Grade 3 but had to quit then to help her mother raise her siblings. She spoke French her whole life but learned English when she got married {{at the age of}} 17. Her husband, who was her child-hood neighbour, also <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to read and write. They had five kids who they raised on their ranch outside of Willow Bunch. They lived on the ranch until 2001, when they sold it and moved into town. She is part of the Ladies of the Parish at the Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|A 21-year-old exorcist, Millenear was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age and placed in the care of her uncle and aunt. They were abusive and one day, Millenear killed them with her spiritual rage. Priest Williams took her in and <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to focus her powers to help people. She became one of the best exorcists employed by the Vatican until she disobeyed the head Bishop of the Vatican to save a possessed girl using her dark magic abilities. She lost her standing as a priest and left the service. Though Deshwitat is often critical of her, she continues to him on his quest to defeat Kalutika. She was captured by Mr. Grey during an assassination attempt on Deshwitat and was turned into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Lawrence {{contracted}} lumbago and {{was given}} a fortnight to recuperate by Charlot, who then saw her at an opening night party at Ivor Novello's invitation two days before she was cleared {{to return to work}} by her doctor, and immediately sacked her. When the apparent reason for her dismissal became common knowledge among other West End producers, she was unable to find work, and in early 1919 she accepted a job singing in the show at Murray's, a popular London nightclub, where she remained {{for the better part of}} the next two years. While performing there she met Captain Philip Astley, a member of the Household Cavalry. He became her friend, escort, and ultimately lover, and <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to dress and behave in high society.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at the farm Leirgrovvik in Bolsøy (now Molde), Norway, as the eldest son of Swiss dairyman Johannes Tanner (a Zwinglian) and native farmer's {{daughter}} Anne Birgitte (née Innholm), who <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> children <b>how</b> to read and instructed them in the Catechism. Jacob was confirmed 24 April 1881, receiving high grades. He was educated in Molde and Kristiania, and became a theologian in 1892. At 27 years of age, he departed from the port of Kristiansand, arriving in New York City, USA, on 19 May 1893.|$|R

2500|$|In 1982, L’Engle {{reflected}} on <b>how</b> suffering had <b>taught</b> <b>her.</b> She told <b>how</b> suffering a [...] "lonely solitude" [...] {{as a child}} <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> about the “world of the imagination” that enabled her to write for children. Later she suffered a [...] "decade of failure" [...] after her first books were published. It was a [...] "bitter" [...] experience, yet she wrote that she had [...] "learned a lot of valuable lessons" [...] that enabled her to persevere as a writer.|$|R
25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to write better.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was about}} 12 years old, {{computer}} repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to play guitar and helped {{with her first}} efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing [...] "Lucky You". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch {{as part of their}} [...] "Rising Stars" [...] campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Badu {{gave birth}} to a daughter, Puma Rose, with her former boyfriend, rapper The D.O.C.. Later that year, she {{received}} her first computer as a Christmas gift from drummer and producer Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, and began communicating with and receiving music from him and other producers such as Q-Tip and J Dilla. Beginning in 2005, Badu worked from her home in Dallas and used the software application GarageBand as a digital audio workstation, which she was introduced to by her son, Seven. He <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to use her laptop as a mini recording studio, and she used it to construct various backing tracks for songs. Using GarageBand, she recorded demos of her vocals by singing into the computer's microphone.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> nuns <b>how</b> to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer.

500|$|Hindley's {{father had}} {{served with the}} Parachute Regiment and had been {{stationed}} in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known in the army as a [...] "hard man" [...] and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to fight, and insisted that she [...] "stick up for herself". When Hindley was 8, a local boy approached her {{in the street and}} scratched both of her cheeks with his fingernails, drawing blood. She burst into tears and ran into her parents' house, to be met by her father, who demanded that she [...] "Go and punch him , because if you don't I'll leather you!" [...] Hindley found the boy and succeeded in knocking him down with a sequence of punches, as her father had taught her.

500|$|Jackson {{started playing}} {{basketball}} at the Albury Sports Centre {{when she was}} four years old.

She first played competitive basketball as a six-year-old she played on a local under-10 side. Her mother was her coach for two years. [...] This was difficult for both mother and daughter in order to change their personal dynamics. As an 11-year-old, Jackson was not {{the best player in}} Albury, but she played in the under-14 Australian Country Championships. Her team made it to the Grand Final one year, and she played in the match despite having hurt her knee. She was upset after the event. In response to this, her parents sat down with her and explained she did not need to continue to play if she did not want to. Following this conversation, she went to her room and typed a message on her computer that said [...] "from this day on, nothing will stand in my way..." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{was born}} in New York City, New York in 1985 and was raised in Lake Placid, a quiet village outside of New York. At age fifteen, she was sent to {{boarding}} school in Connecticut, before moving to New York City at eighteen to study metaphysics at Fordham University. While attending the university, according to Del Rey, her musical experience began here, discovering the right acquaintances on her own. After her uncle <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to play guitar, {{she realized that she}} could probably write [...] "a million" [...] songs with only those six chords. She then began performing in clubs in New York City, using various stage names such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena. Recalling the experience, Del Rey said, [...] "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn – I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point – and that was it".|$|E

50|$|Pauline was the {{slightly}} younger {{of the two}} girls and already a skilled dancer {{at a young age}} when she was touring with her father who was a stage magician known as the Great Cingalee. Pauline met Florence while on tour with their families and a close friendship soon developed.

5000|$|As the {{aircraft}} prepares to taxi for takeoff, Bobby {{is concerned about}} Dugan's treatment of the animals, and decides to stow away aboard the bomber {{so that he can}} make sure his special friends are properly cared for. Julie follows Bobby aboard. During the flight, the bomber goes off course, and Dugan is forced to crash-land on an uncharted island that Bobby has spotted with his keen eyesight. While on the island, the group meets two elderly Japanese holdout soldiers who have lived there alone for 35 years. Dugan treats them as enemies, as the soldiers are unaware that World War II is over. However, Bernadette wins their friendship and trust. They are able to communicate because the mother of one of the soldiers had spent time in America, and she <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> son <b>how</b> to speak English. She even named him [...] "Cleveland", after her favorite place there.|$|R
500|$|Blandine and Cosima were {{subjected}} to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: [...] "Above all, Patersi <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> a 'noble lady' must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, {{his first visit to}} his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as [...] "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, {{all of the time}} that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Dodd {{described}} Mrs. Parker accordingly: [...] "As {{a teacher}} , I had <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to speak; as a legislator, I had gotten her a scholarship {{that gave her}} a college education; and as lieutenant governor, I had found her a big job in our administration. She was a wonderful speaker and a good administrator, but {{she must have been}} a born ingrate." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rose {{is known}} to have {{accompanied}} 1930 Gennett recordings of the Black artists Clara Burston, Walter Coleman and (possibly) Cow Cow Davenport. For this reason he is included in the comprehensive pre-1943 Blues and Gospel discography, and excluded from the comprehensive pre-1943 Country Music discography. However, research published by Christopher King in Issue # 12 of the journal 78 Quarterly suggests otherwise. In an interview, Mildred Justice, the daughter of Dick Justice recalled that her father played with a railway worker called Bailey Rose who she described as [...] "quite a bit older than daddy". He was [...] "the man who sounded the most like daddy" [...] and <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> father <b>how</b> to play [...] "Old Black Dog" [...] and [...] "Brown Gal". She twice asserted that Rose was not Black, but did describe him as dark-skinned and Arab looking. King suggests that he may have been a Melungeon.|$|R
50|$|Anna Calhoun {{was born}} on the Bath plantation, in the Abbeville District of South Carolina, in February 1817. She was one of seven {{children}} in the Calhoun family. Anna adored her father, John C. Calhoun, and remained close to him {{until his death in}} 1850. Her early education was through her surroundings and family, at a day school in Edgefield, South Carolina, then later at South Carolina Female Collegiate Institute, in central South Carolina. Anna stayed at the South Carolina Female Collegiate Institute for about a year before she returned to her family's home at Fort Hill. When she returned, Anna <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> younger brothers <b>how</b> to read and write.|$|R

In 1925, she was the holder of the title of swimming vice-champion of Ukraine (breaststroke). Her professional career would be as an economic planner for the Soviet Union, and chess would remain a hobby.|$|R
