5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition {{again with}} The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror the one from Out of the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir.

5|$|The project {{presented}} {{a variety of}} specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a shoebox auditorium, used in <b>the</b> <b>acclaimed</b> designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Opéra designed by Charles Garnier.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu {{was the first in}} a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Guy said the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of <b>the</b> <b>acclaimed</b> films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used as the title of a 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced <b>the</b> <b>acclaimed</b> , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms.

In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in <b>the</b> <b>acclaimed</b> televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result.

5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on <b>the</b> <b>acclaimed</b> music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
