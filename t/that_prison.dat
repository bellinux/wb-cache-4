5|$|In {{the second}} episode, Naitō is {{found dead in}} prison. Sōta Sarushiro, a friend of Naitō, is {{suspected}} of the murder, but Edgeworth's attempt to investigate is stymied when judge Mikagami assigns prosecutor Yumihiko Ichiyanagi to the case in Edgeworth's place. To investigate, Edgeworth teams up with Tateyuki Shigaraki, a defense attorney and former protégé of Edgeworth's father Gregory. They suspect several inmates, including the assassin Ryōken Hōinbō, {{but it turns out}} <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> warden Marī Miwa killed Naitō, believing that Hōinbō had sent him to kill her. Sarushiro is freed, but Mikagami warns Edgeworth that he could lose his prosecutor's badge if he keeps investigating cases he is not assigned to.|$|E
5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not to move beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E

5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about the exact date of his death. The most common account is that he {{died of natural causes}} in 1945 while serving his sentence at Ucciardone prison in Palermo. Italian author Petacco found evidence for his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino that Cascioferro may have died of dehydration in the summer of 1943. According to Petacco, Cascioferro was left behind in his cell by prison guards while other inmates were evacuated in advance of the Allied invasion of Sicily. However, according to historian Giuseppe Carlo Marino, Cascioferro was transferred to another prison in Pozzuoli in 1940, and the octogenarian was left to die during an Allied bombardment of <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> in 1943 (other sources mention 1942). According to La Stampa, Cascioferro died on September 20, 1943, in the prison on the island of Procida.|$|E

5000|$|Edgardo Lander, a {{sociologist}} {{and professor at}} the Central University of Venezuela with a PhD in sociology from Harvard University explained <b>that</b> Venezuelan <b>prisons</b> were [...] "practically a school for criminals" [...] since young inmates come out [...] "more sort of trained and hardened than when they went in". He also explained <b>that</b> <b>prisons</b> are controlled by gangs and that [...] "very little has been done" [...] to control them.|$|R

25|$|Some {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> authorities colluded {{with the}} INLA in Wright's killing. The INLA strongly denied these rumours, and published {{a detailed account}} of the assassination in the March/April 1999 issue of The Starry Plough newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Berdella also lodged several {{complaints}} with {{prison officials}} regarding prison conditions.

5000|$|It {{is argued}} by the Massachusetts Statewide Harm Reduction Coalition <b>that</b> the <b>prison</b> {{system is in}} {{violation}} of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, and which is prescribing life, liberty, equality and justice to all people without discrimination of any sort as an inalienable right.

25|$|In 1841, Dorothea Dix {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> conditions were, in her opinion, inhumane. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods.

25|$|In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, {{then got}} out of the passenger's side door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand.

At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker, Ryan took a couple of steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.|$|E
50|$|In September 2001, an {{inspection}} report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of <b>Prisons</b> claimed <b>that</b> Holloway <b>Prison</b> was failing {{many of its}} inmates, mainly due to financial pressures.

25|$|In December 2005, a cell-complex for denied {{refugees}} at Amsterdam Airport {{burned down}} after a fire had been started {{by one of}} the refugees. Eleven refugees died. Surviving refugees reported that they had to wait more than 45 minutes before being released from their cells. A man suspected of connections with terrorist organizations had escaped in the disruption. Before the fire's investigation was completed, Verdonk stated <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> workers adequately handled the circumstances. Subsequently, in September 2006, she granted temporary stay permits to many of the survivors of the Schiphol airport detention center fire, overriding the regular court hearing procedures.|$|E
25|$|In June 1966, Manson was sent, for {{the second}} time in his life, to Terminal Island, in {{preparation}} for early release. By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken a number of federal laws. Then as now, federal sentences were much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> had become his home, he requested permission to stay, a fact mentioned in a 1981 television interview with Tom Snyder.|$|E
25|$|Rifkin sued, {{arguing that}} his solitary {{imprisonment}} was unconstitutional. In 2000, a state appellate court determined <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> officials had not violated Rifkin's constitutional rights by housing him in isolation. Rifkin's lawsuit sought $50,000 {{for each of}} his 1,540 days in solitary confinement (totaling $77 million). Had he received any money, {{it would have been}} subject to state laws that earmark most of the award for the families of his victims. Corrections officials say that Rifkin is now imprisoned with more than 200 other inmates at Clinton who are not allowed into the general prison population.|$|E

50|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations.

25|$|Scarver {{alleges that}} {{immediately}} before murdering Dahmer, he had cornered him, presented {{a newspaper article}} detailing Dahmer's crimes, and demanded that Dahmer answer whether the account was true. Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that Dahmer had been openly unrepentant for his crimes; that Dahmer taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and <b>that</b> <b>prison</b> staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for Dahmer, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised {{so that he could}} kill him. Furthermore, Scarver stated that Dahmer was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one guard whenever he was out of his cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane {{has also}} {{published}} work on environmental ethics and punishment.

500|$|Martin {{tells the}} others he was incarcerated for insider trading, {{and that he}} enjoyed certain perks of prison, {{including}} outside time and art classes.

He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of [...] "Prison Mike." [...] Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him {{of his time in}} prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. In order to have his co-workers released, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him.
