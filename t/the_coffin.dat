5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> {{was lifted}} into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|During the funeral, as <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> {{was moving}} from the hearse to the grave site, Navy SEALs were lined up forming a column of twos {{on both sides of}} the pallbearers route, with <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> moving up the center. As <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> passed each SEAL, they slapped down the gold Trident each had removed from his own uniform and deeply {{embedded}} it into the wooden coffin. For nearly 30 minutes the slaps were audible from across the cemetery as nearly every SEAL on the West Coast repeated the act.|$|E
5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> plaque.|$|E

5|$|On 18September Huskisson's {{body was}} placed in a coffin and covered with black silk. Shortly before midnight a team of men {{prepared}} to move <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> to a hearse which had been parked outside since the afternoon, but Emily Huskisson refused to allow them to take the body. Instead, she spent another night in the vicarage with <b>the</b> <b>coffin.</b> The next morning she left in a horse-drawn carriage with the windows covered. <b>The</b> <b>coffin,</b> meanwhile, set off in the hearse for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote and quiet coaching inns to avoid attention, it gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached Liverpool Town Hall late that evening, the hearse was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.|$|E
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. <b>The</b> <b>coffin</b> or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E

Elena and Damon go to find him but Stefan refuses to give them <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> back. Elena leaves and Damon stays back to deal with Stefan who tells him why he stopped him from killing Klaus and reveals him where <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> are and why he took them.|$|R
50|$|These anthropoid ceramic coffins {{appear to}} have been {{associated}} with wealthier individuals and consequently have a trove of expensive small finds. Many beads from necklaces and bracelets made of expensive materials were found inside <b>the</b> <b>coffins.</b> Golden beads in the shapes of palmettes and lotus blossoms were common and showed the incorporation of Egyptian and Near Eastern art motifs in the funerary adornment. Many of the beads found were made out of a semi-precious stone, carnelian. Another interesting find associated with one of <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> at Deir el-Balah was a makeup spoon {{in the shape of a}} diving woman. This is a common motif found in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom period. One of the more important small finds associated with <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> from all sites they were found at are scarabs. Scarabs bearing imagery and the cartouches of New Kingdom Pharaohs, including one of Rameses II, have been found in context with most of <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> and suggest that the people buried in <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> were possibly Egyptian officials.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. <b>The</b> <b>coffin</b> of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in <b>the</b> <b>coffin,</b> {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. <b>The</b> <b>coffin</b> seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} <b>the</b> <b>Coffin</b> family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in <b>the</b> <b>Coffin</b> home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E

5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
25|$|After the autopsies were performed, {{the bodies}} of the Romanovs were washed, dressed in white shrouds, and placed in wooden coffins. There was a funeral service for them on 19 October when <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> were placed in the crypt of the cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Alapayevsk where they {{remained}} until July 1919. Then, as Alapayevsk, was about to be retaken by the Red Army, <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> were moved to Irkutsk. There <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> rested for less than six months, before the advance of the Red army forced their removal eastward. Early in 1920, <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> with <b>the</b> remains of Grand Duke Sergei and those killed with him, were taken out of Russia by train through Harbin. By April 1920 <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> were in Beijing, where they were placed in the crypt of the chapel attached to the Russian Mission. They remained there until 1957 when they were buried at the Russian Orthodox cemetery as the chapel was demolished. The government of the USSR did not have any interest in the preservation of the Russian cemetery in Beijing and in the late 1980s the Chinese authorities converted it into a park. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>coffins</b> are still in place, now buried beneath a parking area. After the Communist regime collapsed the mineshaft, where the Grand Duke was killed with his relatives, became a site of religious pilgrimage, and an orthodox chapel was built there.|$|R

5|$|The Texian {{bodies were}} stacked and burned. The only {{exception}} was {{the body of}} Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna's army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial. The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837, when Juan Seguín returned to Béxar to examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett, and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres. According to a March 28, 1837, article in the Telegraph and Texas Register, Seguín buried <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> under a peach tree grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified. Seguín later claimed that he had placed <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> {{in front of the}} altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton, it is unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of uniforms were found in <b>the</b> <b>coffin,</b> and it is known that the Alamo defenders did not wear uniforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} was worse in Huế, where {{the approach of}} government forces was met by the beating of Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left {{their homes in the}} middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn <b>the</b> <b>coffin</b> of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated <b>the</b> <b>coffin.</b> They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E
