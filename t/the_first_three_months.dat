5|$|Apogee Software {{announced}} on December 12, 1997 {{that they would}} be exclusively publishing FreeSpace for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> before handing the publishing rights back to Interplay Entertainment. This was part of their agreement with Interplay for the latter's purchase of the rights to Descent, and Apogee decided to release FreeSpace as shareware, with themselves as the merchant of the registered version. Interplay, however, bought the full rights to FreeSpace from Apogee in late April, 1998, keeping the ownership of the game solely to themselves.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 2006.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pier}} opened on 5 June 1867, again under Cecil Hugh Smyth Pigott, {{many of the}} people of Weston-super-Mare were given a holiday and a banquet was held in the Town Hall. The toll to walk on the pier was 1d (an old penny), but this was quickly raised to 2d, which was the maximum fee {{permitted}} by the General Pier and Harbour Act 1861. 120,000 people paid the toll in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> A tramway system was installed to carry the luggage of passengers arriving at the pier.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately every six months, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E

40|$|In February 1979, tour Stirling cycle {{cryogenic}} refrigerators, {{developed by}} Philips Laboratories for the John Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory, were launched into orbit aboard the P 78 - 1 spacecraft. The refrigerators {{were designed to}} cool the detectors of two identical gamma-ray spectrometers to 77 K reliably for one year. Since launch, the refrigerators, still in orbit, have individually accumulated from 5, 000 to over 20, 000 hours of operation. As part of those efforts, a refrigerator identical to those in orbit was built, with one significant modification: flexible metal bellows between the crankcase and the working volume to prevent possible contaminants from migrating into the cold region. During the life test of the modified refrigerator, the temperature increase during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> run was 0. 022 k/day, a negligible level. As of October 1982, the unit has accumulated over 12, 300 hours of operation...|$|R
5|$|Admiral Graf Spee spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of {{her career}} {{conducting}} extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Conrad Patzig; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter Warzecha. After joining the fleet, Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy. In the summer of 1936, following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Between August 1936 and May 1937, the ship conducted three patrols off Spain. On the return voyage from Spain, Admiral Graf Spee stopped in Great Britain to represent Germany in the Coronation Review at Spithead for King George VI on 20 May.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> {{of the season}} on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents {{taken from his}} employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, {{this led to a}} high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

5|$|Eurostar's {{passenger}} numbers initially {{failed to}} meet predictions. In 1996, London and Continental Railways forecast that passenger numbers would reach 21.4million annually by 2004, but only 7.3million was achieved. 82 million passengers used Waterloo International Station from its opening in 1994 to its closure in 2007. 2008 was a record year for Eurostar, with a 10.3% rise in passenger use, which was attributed {{to the use of}} High Speed 1 and the move to St Pancras. The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 2009, attributed to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire and the 2009 recession.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Imperial County {{businessmen}} {{hoped to}} promote {{the use of this}} road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles, to increase tourism. Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E
40|$|Background Troponin I (TnI) {{measurement}} {{is important}} in decision making and management of patients who present with chest pain. Undetectable levels of TnI in these patients {{are associated with a}} low risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, and may allow early discharge from hospital. Methods An audit was performed tracking patients who presented with chest pain and had a TnI blood test requested. Routine clinical service was audited for <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> A "fast-track" troponin service and chest pain specialist nurse was then introduced to assist in the management of patients.
