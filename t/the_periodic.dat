5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> law, dubnium should {{belong to}} group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies {{investigated}} {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, in some parts of <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E

With the smallness assumption of <b>the</b> time <b>periodic</b> force, we show that there exists only one time periodic solution and this time periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable in the (Formula presented.) sense.
