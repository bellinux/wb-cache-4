5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on {{improvisation}} {{was essential}} due traditional {{role of the}} music as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E

5|$|Coutances {{had long}} {{experience}} in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices {{from a wide range}} of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} {{in this system}} is on understanding the three marks of existence, dukkha, anatta and anicca. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> is recognizable in the value that is given to vipassanā over samatha, especially in the contemporary Vipassana movement.|$|E

25|$|To {{point out}} 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given {{the variety of}} schools, the {{extended}} history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in words. But common to most schools and teachings is <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.|$|E

25|$|Given <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> on biology in the three-factor approach, {{it would}} be {{expected}} that the third trait, psychoticism, would have a similar explanation. However, the causal properties of this state are not well defined. Eysenck has suggested that psychoticism is related to testosterone levels and is an inverse function of the serotonergic system, but he later revised this, linking it instead to the dopaminergic system.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the {{relationship}} between anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Washington, D.C. {{also offered}} another {{influence}} for the Griffins {{with respect to}} Burnham et al.s 1902 McMillan Plan for the city. Although the Griffins were predominantly influenced by pre-modern planning, notably L’Enfant's inspired emphasis on the picturesque, they achieved <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> through well-orchestrated geometric street organisation representative of the contemporary City Beautiful movement. The movement was strongly implemented in the McMillan Plan, which in turn inspired Canberra's grand axes, views, and effective central focal point.|$|E

25|$|Bakhtin’s {{notion of}} {{carnival}} {{is connected with}} that of the grotesque. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection {{to the life of the}} community. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.|$|E
25|$|This model, then, focuses {{mostly on}} “structural factors” {{of the mass}} media, {{including}} “ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those who make the news and {{have the power to}} define it and explain what it means” (xi). Though the importance of this model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized <b>this</b> <b>emphasis</b> on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E
25|$|McKinley {{relied heavily}} on finance, railroads, {{industry}} and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans {{as the party of}} business. His campaign manager, Ohio's Mark Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on business was in part mitigated by Theodore Roosevelt, the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in trust-busting. McKinley was the first President to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the melodrama or kung-fu action films of the earlier decades, New Taiwanese Cinema films {{are known for their}} realistic, down-to-earth, and sympathetic portrayals of Taiwanese life. These films sought to portray genuine stories of people living either in urban or rural Taiwan, and are often compared stylistically to the films of the Italian neorealism movement. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on realism was further enhanced by innovative narrative techniques. For example, the conventional narrative structure which builds the drama to a climax was abandoned and the story progressed at the pace as it would in real life.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Maharshi's teachings {{were brought}} to the west by Paul Brunton in his A Search in Secret India. Stimulated by Arthur Osborne, in the 1960s Bhagawat Singh {{actively}} started to spread Ramana Maharshi's teachings in the US. Ramana Maharshi has been further popularised in the west by the neo-Advaita movement, which the students of H. W. L. Poonja have been instrumental in, and which gives a western re-interpretation of his teachings placing sole emphasis on insight alone. It has been criticised for <b>this</b> <b>emphasis,</b> omitting the preparatory practices. Nevertheless, Neo-Advaita has become an important constituent of popular western spirituality.|$|E
25|$|The training, knowledge-base, {{and skill}} sets of both paramedics and {{emergency}} medical technicians (EMTs) were typically determined by local medical directors, {{what it was}} felt the community needed, and what was affordable. There were also large differences between localities in the amount and type of training required, and {{how it would be}} provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and up to university level education. <b>This</b> <b>emphasis</b> on increasing qualifications has followed the progression of other health professions such as nursing, which also progressed from on the job training to university level qualifications.|$|E
