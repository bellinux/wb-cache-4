Not only that, but Marquese Chriss would also be named to the All-Rookie Second Team himself that season and Tyler Ulis showcased considerable worth for the Suns after the All-Star break that year. Furthermore, in the 2017 NBA Draft, while the Suns dropped from having a likely #2 pick to the 4th pick in the draft, they still managed <b>to</b> <b>grab</b> <b>a</b> player that was considered a Top 3 prospect in Josh Jackson from the University of Kansas.
