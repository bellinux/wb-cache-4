5000|$|Thus, one cannot say {{the same}} {{on the basis of}} a non{{probability}} sample than {{on the basis of a}} probability sample. The grounds for drawing generalizations (e.g., propose new theory, propose policy) from studies based on nonprobability samples are based on the notion of [...] "theoretical saturation" [...] and [...] "analytical generalization" [...] (Yin, 2014) instead of on statistical generalization. Researchers working with the notion of purposive sampling assert that while probability methods are suitable for large-scale studies concerned with representativeness, non-probability approaches are more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena (e.g., Marshall 1996; Small 2009). One of the advantages of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of a small-N purposive sample or a case study enables the [...] "discovery" [...] and identification of patterns and causal mechanisms that do not draw time and context-free assumptions.|$|E

His core belief--that 'the death of love is a tragedy'--begets proactive, positive solutions ranging from the calculated mapping of a marriage's development to tips for sex-positive communication. Love Lab home tests include a 'Trust Metric,' a true-love indicator and an all-important 'When to Bail' test for sputtering relationships. In the appendixes, the authors further identify and open conversational avenues for partners stymied by intimate communication, past emotional baggage and imbalances in sexual desire. For such an overcrowded topic, this entry manages to be both instructional and enlightening." [...] Barbara Hoffert wrote, [...] "Gottman runs the Love Lab at the University of Washington, Seattle, which sounds hippy-dippy until you realize that his 35 years of research have earned him honors from the National Institute of Mental Health and the American Psychological Association.
