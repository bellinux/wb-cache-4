5|$|Before his {{freshman}} season, he nearly attended Clearwater Central Catholic High School, {{as well as}} IMG Academy, but decided to attend his zoned school, East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida. As a freshman, he played varsity football for East Lake, but mostly on defense. He had 1 reception for a 26-yard touchdown, 2 interceptions and 81 tackles, including 2 forced fumbles. That season East Lake compiled a 9–4 record before losing in the 2011 Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Class 8A region final in overtime to Plant High School on December 2, 2011. Plant had won state championships in 2006, 2008 and 2009. Plant {{went on to become}} state champion that year, marking four consecutive years it had reached a championship game. Campbell accumulated statistics in 12 of the 13 games (not the November 4 game at Palm Harbor University High School). He was named a MaxPreps 2011 U.S. Air Force Freshman All-American first team selection at linebacker, although his <b>true</b> <b>position</b> was safety. He was not selected to the Tampa Bay Times 2011 All-Suncoast Region Football team for Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties or even the Times 2011 All-Pinellas County football team.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{their two}} assaults across the Fontanone stream near Marengo village were repelled, and General Jean Lannes {{reinforced}} the French right. Bonaparte realised the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> and issued orders at 11:00 am {{to recall the}} detachment under Général de Division (GdD) Louis Desaix, while moving his reserve forward. On the Austrian left, Ott’s column had taken Castel Ceriolo, and its advance guard moved south to attack Lannes’s flank. Melas renewed the main assault and the Austrians broke the central French position. By 2:30 pm the French were withdrawing and Austrian dragoons seized the Marengo farm. Bonaparte had by then arrived with the reserve, but Berthier’s troops began {{to fall back on}} the main vine belts. Knowing Desaix was approaching, Bonaparte was anxious about a column of Ott’s soldiers marching from the north, so he deployed his Consular Guard infantry to delay it. The French then withdrew steadily eastward toward San Giuliano Vecchio as the Austrians formed a column to follow them in line with Ott’s advance in the northern sector.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{considered}} {{time and}} space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider concepts as <b>true</b> <b>position</b> and true velocity. Newton also recognized that weight {{as measured by the}} action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy.

25|$|For stars {{significantly}} less than 230 million light years away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the Milky Way, since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of the star is then easily computed from its proper motion and its distance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of annual {{aberration}} of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight {{as seen in the}} Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes {{during the course of the}} year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its <b>true</b> <b>position</b> as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.|$|E

25|$|The Germans were {{helped in}} their escape {{by the failure}} of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven {{critical}} radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the <b>true</b> <b>position,</b> course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet's course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and {{it was clear that the}} battle could no longer be resumed.|$|E

500|$|While {{executing}} a loop near Chuuk, {{the tropical}} depression intensified into Tropical Storm Tip, though the storm failed to organize significantly {{due to the}} influence of Tropical Storm Roger. Reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation, since satellite imagery estimated the center was about [...] from its <b>true</b> <b>position.</b> After drifting erratically for several days, Tip began a steady northwest motion on October 8. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone, resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into Tip. An area of a tropical upper tropospheric trough moved north of Guam at the time, providing an excellent outflow channel north of Tip. Initially, Tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make landfall on Guam, though it turned to the west early on October 9, passing about [...] south of Guam. Later that day, Tip intensified to attain typhoon status.|$|E
