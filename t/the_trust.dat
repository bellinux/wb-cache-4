5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep concern that <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had {{gathered at the}} library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> companies could also be resolved. <b>The</b> <b>trust</b> company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E

5|$|The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust was {{established}} on December 2, 1909, {{for the care}} of orphaned and destitute children in Hawaii. Effective upon her death, the proceeds of her estate, with the exception of twelve individual inheritances specified therein, were to be used for <b>the</b> <b>Trust.</b> The largest of these hereditary estates were willed to her hānai sons and their heirs: John ʻAimoku Dominis would receive Washington Place while Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa would receive Kealohilani, her residence at Waikiki. Both men predeceased the Queen. Before and after her death, lawsuits were filed to overturn her will establishing <b>the</b> <b>Trust.</b> One notable litigant was Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, the nephew of her brother Kalākaua and his wife Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani's second cousin, who brought a suit against <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> on November 30, 1915, questioning the Queen's competency in executing the will and attempting to break <b>the</b> <b>Trust.</b> These lawsuits were resolved in 1923 and the will went into probate.

30|$|Each trusted {{application}} exposes a TA interface. Trusted core framework implementation {{calls the}} TA interface to relay {{communication between the}} client application and <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> application. Once <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework has {{called one of the}} TA entry points, the TA can make use of the TEE internal API to access the facilities of <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> OS. <b>The</b> TEE internal API consists of <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework API, trusted storage API for data and keys, cryptographic operations API, time API, and TEE arithmetical API [19]. The TA interface is a subgroup of <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework API. The TEE internal API can be said to consist of the TA interface and other APIs to access the facilities of <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> OS. If <b>the</b> client application in the normal zone requests secure services through the REE communication agent, <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework implementation calls the TA interface, and the TA may use the TEE internal API to access the facilities of <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> OS, including <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> functions.|$|R

5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. <b>The</b> <b>trust</b> instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trusted</b> Core Framework {{provides}} the OS like functionality to <b>trusted</b> applications, while <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> functions provide support facilities for application developers. Both <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> functions and <b>the</b> <b>Trusted</b> Core Framework {{make use of}} the scheduling function and other OS management functions provided by <b>the</b> <b>Trusted</b> Kernel [19]. <b>The</b> TEE communication agent is a special case of a Trusted Core Framework function API. It works with its peer, the REE communication agent, to safely transfer messages between the CA and <b>the</b> TA. <b>The</b> <b>trusted</b> applications interface {{to the rest of the}} system via the APIs exposed by <b>trusted</b> OS components. <b>The</b> TEE internal API defines the fundamental software capabilities of a TEE [18]. Other APIs may be defined to support interface to further proprietary trusted functions.|$|R

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. <b>The</b> <b>trust</b> presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system.
