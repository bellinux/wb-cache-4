5|$|Initially, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion among families with members serving in the army. It took several months for relations and friends to discover the fate of <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> and name of casualties. Initially, only very few prisoners, usually those working in important civilian industries, were sent back to France.|$|E
5|$|The accused had {{no right}} of appeal.

5|$|At {{certain times}} {{there was an}} {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it {{for much of the}} New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and <b>their</b> <b>relatives).</b> This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} carers’ experience of the transition of <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> who has dementia to nursing home care. It is intended that this will provide evidence-based guidance for the development of initiatives to support carers. This aim is addressed by answering the following questions: 1. What are carers’ key influences in making the decision for <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> to move to a long stay setting? Who is involved in making this decision? 2. What are carers’ experiences of making the transition from caring for <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> at home to them being cared for in a long stay setting? 3. How has the family carer’s role changed as a result of <b>their</b> <b>relative’s</b> move to a long stay setting? 4. What types of roles do carers want to have? 5. How can carers be supported in these roles...|$|R
5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist of invertebrate animals who named and described over 4,000 species, {{specializing in the}} study of arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and <b>their</b> <b>relatives),</b> and myriapods (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), but also publishing on molluscs, marine worms, and insects. By 1941 he had described at least 2,000 species, and by 1957 had described a total of 4,225 new species, 742 new genera, 28 new families, and 12 orders. Chamberlin's taxonomic publications continued to appear until at least 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Jovovich {{attended}} {{and sang}} at the birthday celebration of Mikhail Gorbachev.

5|$|Like <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> in the Elapidae family, the {{majority}} of the Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E

5000|$|In Liberia, some body-collection teams {{dispatched}} {{to collect the}} Ebola dead have collected bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that <b>their</b> dead <b>relative</b> did not die from Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim would also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families {{do not want to}} admit that <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> a traditional burial.|$|R
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and <b>their</b> <b>relatives.</b> The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E

5|$|With {{the removal}} of Constantine VI, Irene {{henceforth}} reigned alone, the first Byzantine empress to do so. Staurakios, however, found his own position increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted servant of the empress, Aetios. Both were engaged in an intense rivalry to place <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> {{in positions of power}} so as to secure control of the Empire after Irene's death.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> the honeybees, {{bumblebees}} feed on nectar, {{using their}} long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
