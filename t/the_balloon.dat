5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b> She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b> The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b> Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> has burst. Graham and Si take <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{he settled}} {{with his family}} at Bramdean House in Alresford, and was {{appointed}} Commander of <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Sections, based at Aldershot {{under the command of}} Col James Templer. In 1906, having briefly become <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Companies, the organisation became the School of Ballooning with Capper as its Commandant. At about the same time <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Factory was split off and moved to a new site nearby at Farnborough and, on Templer's retirement, Capper also became its Superintendent and was given the brevet rank of full colonel. Templer was retained at the factory under Capper to complete the development Britain's first military airship, the Nulli Secundus ("second to none") in a purpose-built airship shed.|$|E
5|$|In Murray, Virginia, the Holvey family {{visits a}} local {{amusement}} park. When the youngest child, Teddy, lets his balloon fly away, his father, Steve, gives him <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> {{that belongs to}} his older brother, Charlie (Joel Palmer). When the boys' mother, Maggie (Helene Clarkson), is in the bathroom, the strap in Teddy's stroller comes undone. Teddy follows <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> floating under its own power out of the restroom and onto the tracks of the park's tour train, leading to him getting killed by the train. Charlie is {{the only member of}} the Holvey family not to grieve Teddy's death at the scene.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> most {{commonly}} used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled balloons. Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic is used for <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> include propaganda messages written on the surface in Korean script. These balloons were developed to replace blimps previously used by the South Korean government, which were no longer being produced. After <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> travel far enough across the border, a timer opens the plastic bags carried by <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> can travel up to 200kilometers, and the maximum load for each balloon is 10kilograms. Fighters for a Free North Korea spends approximately 500 U.S. dollars for each <b>balloon</b> launched; however, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> are considered a low-cost solution.|$|R

50|$|As the Confederates retreated, the war {{turned into}} the Peninsular Campaign. Due to the heavy forests on <b>the</b> peninsula, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> were unable to follow on land so a coal barge was {{converted}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> and their gas generators were loaded aboard and taken down the Potomac, where reconnaissance of the peninsula could continue.|$|R
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> down. However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> convinced him that <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
50|$|After the {{war years}} <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> were {{neglected}} slightly {{in place of the}} new Coronation Cars, as they were considered old fashioned and too slow to load. Blackpool Corporation soon changed its mind after experiencing the temperamental nature of the Coronations and <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> began to make a comeback in the late 1950s. In 1958 check rail was installed through to Fleetwood, a requirement to allow <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> to operate to Fleetwood and <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> increasingly began to appear on market-day specials, as they were useful for moving the large crowds travelling north. <b>The</b> <b>Balloons</b> continued to run their normal Squires Gate service until its closure in 1961 and following this the entire class solely worked on the promenade service.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the Admiralty {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> could be produced at very little cost; {{many of the}} important parts already existed as surplus materials, and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, {{there was plenty of}} hydrogen gas with which to fill <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.|$|R
50|$|Many {{local artists}} take {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> as favorite subject matter for their paintings. Balloons often land in Albuquerque neighborhoods. Many residents watch <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> from <b>the</b> comfort of their backyards.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{afterwards}} <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Factory {{was removed}} from the command of the Army and a new civilian superintendent, Mervyn O'Gorman, appointed. Capper remained in command of the Army Balloon School.|$|E
5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b> At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrogen}} gas must be manufactured, and <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> filled, at the Arctic launch site.|$|E

40|$|After {{introducing}} a mathematical {{definition of the}} tail-like equilibrium and the dipole-like equilibrium in the magnetosphere, it is shown by using physical intuition based on the Energy Principle that the incompressible assumption for <b>the</b> <b>ballooning</b> instability is more valid for the tail-like configuration when <b>the</b> unstable <b>ballooning</b> mode is strongly localized near the equator. Therefore, before the substorm onset, the near-Earth plasma sheet becomes more tail-like {{and more likely to}} be subject to <b>the</b> <b>ballooning</b> instability without <b>the</b> stabilizing influence of the compressibility, when the critical plasma β due to the stabilizing tension force is exceeded. The onset of <b>the</b> <b>ballooning</b> instability in <b>the</b> near-Earth plasma sheet seems promisingly relevant to the substorm onset phenomena.

50|$|From the 17 October 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> (and {{all other}} double decker trams) were banned from going north of Thornton Gate {{due to the}} poor {{condition}} of the track. Following heavy repair work <b>the</b> <b>Balloons</b> were allowed back from Easter 2004.|$|R
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's Skooters, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Race, Paratrooper, Ferris wheel, and Spider.

5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. <b>The</b> <b>Balloon</b> Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
50|$|The first major-scale use of <b>balloons</b> in <b>the</b> {{military}} {{occurred during}} the American Civil War with <b>the</b> Union Army <b>Balloon</b> Corps established and organized by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe {{in the summer of}} 1861. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> were inflated with coal gas from municipal services and then walked out to the battlefield, an arduous and inefficient operation as <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> had to be returned to the city every four days for re-inflation. Eventually hydrogen gas generators, a compact system of tanks and copper plumbing, were constructed which converted the combining of iron filings and sulfuric acid to hydrogen. The generators were easily transported with <b>the</b> uninflated <b>balloons</b> to <b>the</b> field on a standard buckboard. However, this method shortened the life of <b>the</b> <b>balloons,</b> because traces of the sulfuric acid often entered <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> along with <b>the</b> hydrogen. In all, Lowe built seven balloons that were fit for military service.|$|R
50|$|This {{is often}} done using a mule's {{gastrointestinal}} tract or other body cavities as containers. Swallowing {{has been used}} for the transportation of heroin, cocaine, and MDMA/Ecstasy. A swallower typically fills tiny balloons with small quantities of a drug. <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> may be made with multilayered condoms, fingers of latex gloves, or more sophisticated hollow pellets. One smuggling method involves swallowing <b>the</b> <b>balloons,</b> which are recovered later from the excreted feces. Alternately, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> may be hidden in other natural or artificial body cavities - such as rectum, colostomy, vagina, and mouth - although this method is far more vulnerable to body cavity searches. A drug mule may swallow dozens upon dozens of <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> swallower then attempts to cross international borders, excrete <b>the</b> <b>balloons,</b> and sell <b>the</b> drugs.|$|R
50|$|Hitting any of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> with <b>the</b> clown {{causes them}} to burst, and the player {{receives}} 20 points for bursting <b>the</b> yellow <b>balloon,</b> 50 points for <b>the</b> green <b>balloon,</b> and 100 points for <b>the</b> blue <b>balloon.</b> Bursting <b>the</b> entire row of balloons causes a sound effect and awards the player 10 times the original points as a bonus (i.e. 200 points for <b>the</b> yellow <b>balloon).</b> A new row of <b>balloons</b> instantly replaces <b>the</b> old one when the entire row is destroyed.|$|R
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
5|$|From September 1861 through August 1863, Fort Corcoran {{served as}} the {{official}} headquarters for the Union Army Balloon Corps, commanded by Thaddeus S. C.

5|$|Spider-Man {{joined the}} Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> floats, {{designed}} by John Romita Sr., one of the character's signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float is scheduled to appear from at least 2009 to 2011.|$|E
50|$|It is {{becoming}} more common for balloons {{to be filled with}} air instead of helium, as air-filled balloons will not release into the atmosphere or deplete the earthly helium supply. There are numerous party games and school-related activities that can use air-filled balloons as opposed to helium balloons. When age-appropriate, these activities often include the added fun of blowing <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> up. In many events, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> will contain prizes, and party-goers can pop <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> to retrieve <b>the</b> items inside.|$|R
50|$|Following these incidents, new {{procedures}} {{were put in}} place, which included stowing <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> during <b>the</b> winter months, with regular deployment exercises and a standby team on alert to deploy <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> in case of attack. The idea of free-floating balloons was also used in Operation Outward.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>ballooning</b> {{instability}} {{should be}} examined with the global energy principle based on the plasma parameters along magnetic field lines or the global eigenvalue analysis. So, the local analysis done in this paper is an approximation. However, {{the results indicate that}} <b>the</b> <b>ballooning</b> instability may occur in the growth phase of the substorm.|$|R
5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> moved swiftly {{across the}} night {{side of the}} planet into the light side, where their {{batteries}} finally ran down and contact was lost. Tracking indicated that the motion of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> included a surprising vertical component, revealing vertical motions of air masses {{that had not been}} detected by earlier probe missions.|$|R
50|$|Nobody {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> {{could have}} come directly from Japan. It was thought that <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> must be coming from North American beaches, launched by landing parties from submarines. Wilder theories speculated {{that they could have}} been launched from German prisoner of war camps in the U.S., or even from Japanese-American internment centers.|$|R
50|$|The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) {{found that}} the {{operator}} of <b>the</b> upper <b>balloon,</b> <b>the</b> operator of <b>the</b> <b>ballooning</b> company to which both balloons belonged, had failed {{to give way to}} <b>the</b> lower <b>balloon</b> as required by the company's operations manual. The investigation report said that <b>the</b> upper <b>balloon</b> was found to be missing the mandatory instrument package and that its pilot had refused to cooperate with investigators. Both balloons were fitted with ultra high frequency radios operating on the same channel, but neither pilot contacted the other.|$|R
