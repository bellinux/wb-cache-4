40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon {{dates and}} glaciological {{features}} of the Ward Hunt area along northernmost Ellesmere Island suggest the following chronology, {{which is consistent with}} world-wide climatic oscillations: I) 10, 000 - 4100 B. P. : deglaciation, and develop-ment of several marine levels, particularly one now 40 m. above sea level, at 7500 f 300 B. P.; 2) 4100 - 2400 years B. P. : climatic deterioration, glacial readvance and forma-tion of ice shelves; 3) 2400 - 1400 years B. P. : general climatic amelioration; development of dust ablation horizon on Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, glacial retreat; 4) 1 4 0 0 B. P. - present: climatic deterioration, with renewed thickening of Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, and beginnings of growth of ice rises; the last-mentioned experienced maximum growth in the interval between 350 - 170 years ago; slight glacial readvance. The isostatic rebound curve for northernmost Ellesmere Island differs from that of the Tanquary Fiord area 80 miles (128 km.) to the south because of direring Pleistocene ice <b>thickenesses.</b> We estimate these to average at least 600 m. for the former area, and 1800 m. for the latter.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{executed}} to determine optimum thickness of banana slice for enclosed solar drying and to evaluate the Natural Resource Institute (NRI) -modified local Kawanda solar cabinet dryer under Ethiopian condition. In this study, six slice thicknesses of banana and NRI-modified solar cabinet dryer were evaluated from 2006 to 2007. The percentages of sticked, mouldy, brown and shriveled slices and moisture content and percentage of acceptable slices were determined after four days of drying. The {{results indicated that the}} percentages of sticked, shriveled and brown slices decreased whereas the moisture content increased as the slice thicknesses increased. Percentage of mouldy slices was higher at 6 mm (38 %) whereas no mouldy slices were observed at slice thicknesses of 1 to 4 mm and vey few (3 %) mouldy slices at 5 mm. Moisture contents of less than 20 % were achieved after four days of drying at all slice thicknesses except at 5 and 6 mm. Large percentages of acceptable slices were obtained at 3 and 4 mm thicknesses. From these results, banana slice thicknesses of 3 and 4 mm were selected as optimal for enclosed solar drying. The dryer was confirmed to be suitable for Ethiopian condition. However, it is expensive and not handy for small-scale households. Hence, we reduced the size of the dryer three times. Therefore, we suggest the use of NRI-modified rural Kawanda solar cabinet dryer for medium-scale drying whereas the JUCAVM-modified dryer for small-scale households using banana slice <b>thickenesses</b> of 3 and 4 mm.

40|$|Films of $CuInSe_ 2 $ were {{deposited}} onto glass substrates by a hot wall deposition method under {{thermodynamic equilibrium}} condition using bulk $CuInSe_ 2 $ {{as a source}} material. All the deposited CuInSe 2 films {{were found to be}} polycrystalline in nature exhibiting the chalcopyrite structure with the crystallite orientation along (101), (112), (103), (211), (220), (312) and (400) directions. The crystallites were found to have a preferred orientation along the (112) direction. Microstructural parameters of the films, such as grain size, dislocation density, tetragonal distortion and strain have been determined. The grain sizes in the films have been found in the range of 89 to 244 nm. Hall effect studies have been carried out on the hot wall deposited $CuInSe_ 2 $ thin films. Hall voltage has been measured as a function of temperature in the range 80 to 460 K. The obtained positive Hall voltage indicates that the prepared $CuInSe_ 2 $ films are of p-type nature with holes as majority charge carriers. The Hall co-efficient is found to decrease with increase in film thickness. The carrier concentration in $CuInSe_ 2 $ films is found to be of the order of $ 10 ^{ 17 } cm^{- 3 }$. The carrier concentration is observed to increase with increase in film thickness. The Hall mobility is found to increase very slowly in the low temperature region from 80 to about 215 K, and then rapidly with increase in temperature above 215 K. The mobility is found to increase with increase in film thickness. The dependence of $T^{ 3 / 2 }$ law for Hall mobility indicates that scattering on ionized impurities is predominant in the temperature region above 215 K in hot wall deposited $CuInSe_ 2 $ thin films. The grain boundary potential (Eb) of $CuInSe_ 2 $ thin films of different <b>thickenesses</b> has been evaluated. The barrier height is observed to decrease with increase in carrier concentration indicating the presence of partially depleted grains in $CuInSe_ 2 $ films. $CuInSe_ 2 $-based solar cells with CdS as buffer layer were fabricated.

40|$|ABSTRACT – (Leaf anatomy {{variation}} {{within and}} between three “restinga ” populations of Erythroxylum ovalifolium Peyr. (Erythroxylaceae) in Southeast Brazil). Erythroxylum ovalifolium is a woody shrub widespread in the “restinga”, i. e. the open scrub vegetation of the Brazilian coastal sandy plains. We examined leaf anatomy variation of this species both within populations and between populations of three “restingas ” {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro. Sites were ca. 100 km far from each other and differed in regard to rainfall and vegetation structure: a dry, open site; a wet, dense site and an intermediate one. Microhabitats within sites were: (i) exposed to full irradiance, outside vegetation islands; (ii) partially exposed to full irradiance, at the border of vegetation islands; (iii) shaded, inside vegetation islands. Leaf anatomy parameters were measured for five leaves collected in each of five plants per microhabitat, in each population; they were thickness of the leaf blade, of the palisade and spongy parenchyma, and of the adaxial and abaxial epidermis. Leaves from the dry, open site had narrower abaxial epidermis and a smaller contribution of spongy parenchyma to total leaf blade <b>thickeness</b> than the other two sites, which we attributed to water stress. Adaxial epidermis and leaf are thicker in more exposed microhabitats (i and ii, above), irrespective of site. We proposed that between-site anatomical variation in traits related to water stress, and within-site anatomical variation in traits related to light-use are indicative of ecological plasticity and might help explain the high abundance of E. ovalifolium in the studied populations and along the State of Rio de Janeiro coast.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{dynamics}} {{is crucial to}} the understanding of how a glacier responds to fluctuations in climate. The driving forces behind glacier flow are determined by ice thickness and surface slope. A multi-dataset approach was used to determine these factors for Hellstugubreen, a small (3. 38 km 2 in 2009) valley glacier located on the west-east water divide in the Jotunheimen region of south-western Norway, between 1941 and 2009. Maps for the glacier exist from the 1940 s onwards and it has long records of frontal changes, velocity and mass balance data. The most recent DEM was created from LiDAR data, while the DEMs for the older maps were genereated from the contour lines. Volume changes and surface slope were computed by subtracting the DEMs. Between 1941 and 2009, Hellstugubreen lost 58 % of its mass (the equivalent of a 20 m water layer) and saw its extent reduced by 20 %. Losses have been constant, {{with the exception of a}} slight advance and volume gain in the 1990 s. Hellstugubreen behaved according to its location on the west-east profile in the region, and its volume and frontal have fluctuated in line with other glaciers in the area. It was found that both local and global (NAO) climate influence the ice mass. The compared stakes for the different datasets show an increase in the angle of the surface slope, but no spatial pattern could be established in these changes. Changes in ice thickness were determined by combining the DEMs with interpolated data obtained during an echo sounding survey in 2011. Thus, driving stresses could be computed for selected stakes. With great fluctuations in both ice <b>thickeness</b> and slope, driving stresses have changed considerably, from - 50 % to 45 % between 1941 and 2009. During the same period, Hellstugubreen’s average annual surface velocity increased by 15 %, from 8. 14 m yr- 1 in 1941 to 9. 53 m yr- 1 in 2009. However, the differences in average daily velocity are too small to be statistically significant. The steepening of the surface could have countered the effects from the ice loss, at least partly. However, the velocity changes are not in correspondence with the magnitude of volume changes, pointing to other factors influencing the surface flow. An investigation of vertical velocity, longitudinal stress and the glacier’s hydrological system would greatly benefit future research. Both a study of the glacier bed and the application of existing climatic models would allow for the assessment of impact of possible climate change...|$|E

Os resultados indicam que o diluente influencia no peso médio e relação diâmetro / espessura das formulações, o que é evidenciado pelas diferentes propriedades plásticas da celulose microcristalina e do fosfato de cálcio diidratado. Por outro lado, a eficiência de dissolução é uma resposta influenciada pelo uso do desintegrante. Considerando as recomendações da OMS para dissolução de medicamentos contendo fármacos de classe I ou III do Sistema de Classificação Biofarmacêutica, tal resultado indica que, somente com o uso de crospovidona ou croscarmelose, é possível alcançar uma liberação de 85 % da dose em não mais do que 15 minutos, mesmo se tratando de um fármaco de alta solubilidade. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{characterize}} immediate release mini-tablets containing amlodipine besylate. Accordingly, a pre-formulation study of samples of the drug from different suppliers was carried out. The results indicate that the active ingredient is highly-soluble, as defined by the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. Furthermore, no differences in the crystalline structures of the raw material in question were encountered. Subsequently, a study of the intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) of amlodipine besylate was carried out using a fractional factorial design (33 - 1), whose variables were the dissolution medium, rotation speed and compaction pressure. We ascertained that the IDR of amlodipine besylate is mainly affected by the dissolution medium. Finally, nine batches of mini-tablets (F 1 to F 9) containing the drug for immediate release were produced in accordance with a complete factorial design (32), in which the impact of the diluent and the excipient on the physical characteristics of the formulation and on the dissolution of the active ingredient was assessed. The results indicate that the diluent influences the average weight and the diameter / <b>thickeness</b> ratio of the formulations, which is evidenced by the different plastic properties of microcrystalline cellulose and calcium phosphate dihydrate. On the other hand, dissolution efficiency is influenced by the use of the disintegrant. Considering WHO recommendations for the dissolution of medications containing class I or III drugs of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, this result indicates that it is possible to attain 85 % of the dosage dissolved in less than 15 minutes only with the use of crospovidone or croscarmellose, even for a highly-soluble drug...|$|E
40|$|A proposta de trabalho seguiu a linha de pesquisa iniciada no mestrado, na qual foi avaliado o efeito da película de fécula de {{mandioca}} natural como revestimento pós-colheita de limão Siciliano. A película de fécula atua como barreira física, da mesma forma que ceras, plásticos, proteínas, entre outras matérias-primas. Os resultados embora promissores, foram pouco uniformes. As razões para essa desuniformidade pode estar nas características do filme, que ainda não tinham sido estabelecidas. O objetivo desta pesquisa, foi caracterizar esses filmes na expectativa de elucidar as causas da variação e tornar o filme aplicável ao setor hortifrutícola. Para contornar a fragilidade dos filmes de fécula natural foram elaborados filmes com féculas modificadas: carboximetilamido (CMA) de baixa e alta viscosidade, {{cross link}} (pré gelatinizado modificado) e esterificada, todas com 3 e 5 % de matéria-seca (MS). As soluções filmogênicas foram secas por 24 hs/ 40 ºC em suporte de plexiglass. Logo após a secagem, os filmes foram acondicionados a 20 ºC e 64 % de umidade relativa, em uma atividade de água de 0, 645 por 10 dias, para análises posteriores. Os filmes assim obtidos foram comparados com os filmes de policloreto de vinila (PVC). As avaliações foram quanto às características microscópicas, físicas e dimensionais, além das propriedades mecânicas e de barreira ao vapor d' água. As espessuras mínimas alcançadas foram 0, 5 - 0, 6 mm nos filmes de fécula cross link. Não houve interferência da espessura na permeabilidade ao vapor d' água, onde os filmes com 5 % de MS, independentemente do tipo de fécula modificada, apresentaram-se mais permeáveis e onde os filmes de fécula esterificada à 5 % atingiram o maior valor com 0, 55 g. mm/m 2. dia. mmHg de permeabilidade. Os filmes apresentaram alto índice de solubilidade (superior à 65 %) [...] .. This work follws the research {{line of the}} master of Science thesis, where natural cassava starch film of was evaluated as post-harvest a coating of sicilian lemon. The starch film acts as a physical barrier {{in the same way}} as waxes, plastics, proteins and other raw materials. The results were variable due to the lack of stardardization of the characteristics of the films, which still have to be established. The aim of the current work was to elucidate the problems previously found with natural starch and to develop a film to replace those in use for wrapping fruits and vegetables. The new film s made of newewable and biodegradable raw material, does not leave residue, it is cheap and non-toxic. Films of the following modified starches were developed: caboximetil starch (CMS) of low and high viscosity, cross link and esterified, with 3 and 5 % of dry matter (DM). The film forming solutions were dried for 24 h/ 40 ºC in plexiglass support. Subsequently the films were stored at 20 ºC and 64 % of relative humidity in an water activity of 0, 645 for 10 days, for further analysis. The microscopic, physic and dimensional characteristics were evaluated as well as the mechanical properties and water vapor permeability. The results still showed a film with problems to humidity, but with high solubility index (superior to 65 %). There was no interference of the thickness on the permeability to water vapor. The films with 5 % of DM, independently of the modified starch showed to be more permeable whist the esterified starch films at 5 % reached a permeability of 0, 55 gmm/m 2. day. mmHg. The minimium <b>thickeness</b> observed was 0, 5 - 0, 6 mm in pregelatinized starch films. All films showed brightness and transparency similar to a PVC film of low density. With regard to mechanical properties, malformation in perforation and traction indicated a non-elastic film [...] . (Complete abstract, click electronic address below) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Masters of Technology: Radiography in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyBACKGROUND: Diabetic patients {{are at increased risk}} of cardiovascular events and stroke, and its prevention is therefore the desired goal. In the arsenal of available techniques, ultrasound plays a vital role in primary healthcare. It is reliable, cost-effective and a noninvasive diagnostic tool that may prove beneficial for screening individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke in SA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrelationships between carotid ultrasound findings with glycaemia status and contributing risk factors of atherosclerosis in the selected population. METHODS: Initially blinded by the glycaemia status, blood results, contributing risks and patient demographics, both carotid arteries were evaluated with duplex ultrasound (DUS), during July 2010 – July 2011. Using graphs, figures, frequency tables, {{means and standard deviations for}} the selected study population, univariate, multivariate and stepwise regression analysis was done to determine the association between ultrasound findings and risk factors for atherosclerosis. The hypothesis tested in this study was to determine if there is an increased incidence of carotid artery intima-media thickening (CIMT), plaque formation and stenosis in patients diagnosed with T 2 DM and hyperglycaemia in a very specific sub-population of mixedancestory, residing in Bellville South Africa (BSA). RESULTS: Of 534 subjects, 375 were of mixed ancestry and ≥ 35 yrs of age, which met the inclusion criteria for the carotid ultrasound substudy. The glycaemic status for each individual was established, and 44 % (165 / 375) were diagnosed hyperglycaemic, of which 66. 7 % (110 / 165) were diabetic (T 2 DM) and 33. 3 % (55 / 165) were pre-diabetic (Pre-DM). Majority (56 %: 265 / 375) had a normal glycaemic status. The ultrasound measurement of the carotid wall thicknesses (Mean Rt. and Lt. CIMT) revealed a statistically significant rise from normal glycaemia status to DM status for both the males (p = 0. 0115 *; p = 0. 0259 *) and females (p < 0. 0001 **; p < 0. 0001 **) respectively. In terms of plaques and internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (124 / 375), when grouped into normal and hyperglycaemic sub-groups, indicated plaque presence and some form of narrowing. A < 50 % stenotic ratio noted in 61 % (76 / 124) of the hyperglycaemic group, that was 1. 6 times higher than those with normal glycaemia (48 / 124). Predisposing factors demonstrated significantly higher levels in the females than in the males. The univariate multiple regression analysis after adjusted R² of 0. 3247 for all independent variables (predisposing /contributing risk factor markers) of age (yrs.), SBP (mmHg), hs-CRP (mg/L), S-Cotinine (ng/mL) and LDL (mmol/L) showed statistically significant positive associations with dependent variable of the mean carotid wall thickness (p < 0. 0001 **, p< 0. 0001 **, p = 0. 0033 *, p = 0. 0409 * and p = 0. 0044) * respectively. Statistically significant positive differences and standard error (SE), for every unit of change (1 yr.) of age (yrs.), as a contributing factor for herosclerosis, there was a change in the mean carotid wall thickness as predicted according to this model. The total contribution of independent risk factors to CIMT ultrasound measurements were calculated as 34. 5 % (Adjusted R² = 0. 3247). In the multivariate stepwise regression analysis, the independent variables of age (p< 0. 0001) ** and systolic blood pressure (p < 0. 0001) ** showed the strongest positive association with carotid wall <b>thickeness</b> changes. The hs-CRP (mg/L) inflammatory markers (p = 0. 0014) * and LDL (mmol/L) (p = 0. 0208) * were the 2 nd and 3 rd highest positive associated contributory risk factors for carotid artery wall thickening. The hip circumference (p = 0. 0008) * and waist circumference (p = 0. 0 555) + risk factors related to obesity was significant and approached significance, respectively, with the predicted increase of carotid artery wall thickening. CONCLUSION: Subjects diagnosed with T 2 DM and hyperglycaemia had increased levels of CIMT, plaques and carotid artery stenosis, compared to those subjects without T 2 DM. Age and systolic blood pressure, inflammatory (raised hs-CRP) and LDL cholesterol changes, and central (truncal) waist circumference adiposity, were positively associated with increased carotid intima media thickness. Smoking (S-Cotinine) and gender also reflected a direct relationship with CIMT changes. The hip circumference adiposity and diastolic blood pressure measurements were not directly associated with an increase in CIMT, which are in keeping with hypertension and obesity formulas. These findings confirm the association of thickened CIMT, plaques and stenosis with ‘unhealthy’ T 2 DM subjects at higher risk of CVD and stroke. The total contribution of independent risk factors to CIMT measurements were calculated as 34. 5 % (Adjusted R² = 0. 3247). The gathered information, discussion of results, and concluding statements thereby supports the recommendation of carotid artery ultrasound evaluation, for screening and diagnosis in primary health care, for ‘flagging’ high risk individuals at risk of stroke, so that lifestyle changes and appropriate management is early adopted...|$|E
