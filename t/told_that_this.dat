5|$|Mariano was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use {{only by the}} bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was going to happen, but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{role of women}} in active service was that of a {{searchlight}} operator. In fact, all {{of the members of the}} 93rd Searchlights Regiment were females (Harris). Despite being limited in their roles, there was a great amount of respect between the men and women in the mixed batteries. In fact, one report states, “Many men were amazed that women could make adequate gunners despite their excitable temperament, lack of technical instincts, their lack of interest in aeroplanes and their physical weaknesses”. While women still faced discrimination from some of the highly stereotypical older soldiers and officers who did not like women “playing with their guns”, women were still given rifle practice and taught to use anti-aircraft guns while serving in their batteries. They were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was in case the Germans invaded…however if that were to ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately.).|$|E
25|$|Conrad {{provided}} {{intelligence on}} Nazi occultism and the build up of German forces {{in preparation for}} World War II. On Friday, 11 March 1938, Conrad received a message from an Austrian living near the Austrian/German border, reporting that German forces were advancing from Bad Tölz and Rosenheim towards the Austrian border. The timeliness of this information is critical to political and military manoeuvres. Knowing this, Conrad used the most expedient method available to transmit the message, phoning the report directly to London, even though it exposed his cover. He was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the first news received from Allied capitals reporting the advance. Conrad continued to receive confirmations of the advance throughout the day. Through his local contacts {{he was able to}} warn residents, giving many in danger time to quickly pack and flee—saving lives. The ease of travel quickly changed, and by the next morning Gestapo officials were ripping soles from passengers' shoes in search of money and incriminating documents. At 9 a.m., Saturday morning, 12 March, a large force of German troops entered Kitzbühel, with another at Mittenwald to occupy Innsbruck and the country west as far as the Arlberg Pass.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{received}} {{another call}} from General Shelton in July 1999 {{in which he}} was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was surprised by this, because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston {{was not going to be}} appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation [...] "didn't wash"; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston's reassignment, although David Halberstam wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with the love affair of two young people, both of whose parents are anxious that they should wed. Young Marlow sent by his father to court {{the daughter of an}} old friend, Mr. Hardcastle. Marlow has spent very little time in the company of the fairer sex, and as a consequence thereof is always shy and nervous in their presence. He, therefore, accepts his father's orders unwillingly and, accompanied by his friend, young Hastings, rides out to meet his future bride. On the road the travelers encounter Hardcastle's stepson, Tony Lumpkin, who in revenge for punishment his stepfather has inflicted, directs Marlow and his friend to the Hardcastle mansion, claiming that it is an inn where they will be well treated. In the meantime, great preparations are being made at the Hardcastle home for the reception of Hardcastle's old friend, and when Tony ushers in young Marlow, thinking Hardcastle merely the proprietor of an inn, he treats him with scant courtesy and orders him about, much to the older man's chagrin. Hardcastle is subjected to his daughter's extravagant costumes, and she appears on this memorable evening dressed in a simple dress and wearing the cap and apron that housewives in the neighborhood assume. This costume greatly pleases her father, but leads young Marlow further astray. He immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is a most attractive barmaid and loses his heart to her in short order. Upon the arrival of his father, Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question, but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle's daughter, claiming that she is too grand for him, and citing his preference for the maid servant. While in the act of making love to the supposed barmaid he is discovered by his father, and, when <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the young lady his father had intended him to marry, he is overjoyed, as he feels sure that his bashful disposition would never have allowed him to woo and win her had he known her to be a lady of fashion." ...|$|E

First {{published}} anonymously in 1948, it {{has become one of}} the best-known Dutch novels and a staple of literary education for many Dutch school children. The novel, a Bildungsroman, is set in the Dutch East Indies, and tells the story of an anonymous narrator growing up on a plantation in the Dutch colony West Java. His childhood friend is a boy of the same age, but of native descent. As the narrator grows up he finds himself becoming estranged from his friend, as a result of the political and racial circumstances of colonial life.

Thereupon, the angel of death starts beating the soul and extracts it from the body in a most painful way. The painful process of taking out a sinner's soul has been compared with [...] "the dragging of an iron skewer through moist wool, tearing the veins and sinews." [...] The soul is then wrapped in a dirty cloth which emits bad smell. Carrying the soul, the angels head towards the sky. On the way, other angels inquire about this wicked soul. They are <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the soul of that and that sinner person. The angels then arrive at the upper sky, but its doors are not opened for the evil soul. Consequently, the soul is then thrown in lowest stage of the earth called 'Sijjin' where it is punished until the Day of Judgment.|$|E
