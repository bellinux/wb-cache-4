40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} Lamb waves to detect and locate laminar damages using a beam forming imaging methodology. Beam forming is using a network of transducers {{that are used to}} sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving guided wave pulses. An image of the damage is reconstructed by analysing the cross correlation of the scatter signal with the excitation pulse and enables the detection and location of potential damage areas. The results of simulation and experimental studies show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damages with locating inaccuracies in the order of a few millimeters within inspection areas of 300 x 300 mm 2 using a transducer network of only four transducer elements.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{possibility}} of using measured transient vibration data in the detection of multiple cracks on beams by following the Bayesian probabilistic framework. The proposed method adopts different classes of models in modelling a beam with different numbers of cracks. The number of cracks on the beam can then be identified by calculating the probability of a model class conditional on a given set of measured transient vibration data. By following the Bayesian probabilistic framework, the posterior probability density functions (PDFs) for a set of crack parameters, such as the crack locations and the corresponding extents, can be calculated. The PDFs allow engineers to quantify the uncertainties associated with the results of crack detection. The paper reports not only the theoretical developed but also the experimental verification of the proposed method. C. <b>T.</b> <b>Ng,</b> M. Veidt and H. F. La...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of a suspension footbridge are investigated through modal identification. Despite its appearance, the {{dynamic characteristics}} of the footbridge are atypical of suspension bridges. Human excitation was used to provide initial conditions of sufficient amplitude for generating free vibration signatures during testing. A conventional modal identification method based on least-square minimization of {{the discrepancy between the}} measured and model response is adopted for identifying the modal characteristics. The method has been augmented to allow multiple data sets to be incorporated in the identification of modal parameters. This capability is called for by the available data sets. The results show that the suspension footbridge behaves predominantly as a beam rather than as a typical suspension bridge, although the suspension hangers do contribute to stiffening of the bridge.

40|$|Studies on pointwise {{prediction}} of nonlinear time series have revealed some distinguishing features of nonlinear prediction. Being {{significantly different from}} linear prediction, the prediction accuracy for nonlinear time series depends on the current position in the state space. Furthermore, small perturbation in current position can lead to considerable errors in nonlinear prediction (see Yao and Tong 1994 a.) The above features can also be observed in state-dependent interval/region prediction. In this paper, we consider two types of region predictors [...] - the maximum conditional density region and the shortest conditional modal interval, both of them depending on the current position in the state space.
