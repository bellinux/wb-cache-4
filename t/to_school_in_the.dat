5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that he had to go <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Kuok Brothers began {{acquiring}} sugar plantations in 1952 {{and founded}} Perlis Plantations Berhad in 1968 to house its sugar cane cultivation and milling business. The company also established Malaysian Sugar Manufacturing Company (MSM), a sugar refiner, in 1959. Kuok said {{the choice to}} switch from the rice to sugar business was due to tough competition in the rice market in the 1950s. Having gone <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English-medium Raffles Institution in Singapore, he also had an advantage in the sugar industry since the sugar trade was conducted in English.|$|E

500|$|As {{with most}} of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe {{daylight}} saving time. In 1973, Governor Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often {{in the morning on}} standard time, energy use would increase in the evening should the state observe daylight saving time. He {{went on to say that}} energy use would also rise early in the day [...] "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." [...] Additionally, he said that daylight savings time would cause children to go <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.|$|E

His {{father was an}} English doctor {{who served as a}} {{physician}} to Patrick Henry and General James Wolfe. Little is known about Hinde's early years except that the family moved from Virginia to Newport, Kentucky, in 1797 when his father was awarded a land grant of [...] for his services in the American Revolutionary War. In a letter to President James Madison many years later, Hinde related that while walking <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness of Kentucky, he once successfully fought off a wolf and a panther. Daniel Boone [...] and Simon Kenton were neighbors of the Hinde family while they lived in Kentucky, and the three men grew up as colleagues. One of Hinde's sisters married Richard Southgate; his nephews William Wright Southgate and William Taylor became prominent lawyers and politicians.|$|E
500|$|The next year, the California Highway Commission {{declined}} {{to have the}} Campo road improved. However, the Highway94 association, {{as well as the}} Campo-Potrero and Highway80 chambers of commerce raised concerns about the safety of the children going <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buses along the road. In 1952, the Southern California committee of the state Chamber of Commerce recommended to the California Highway Commission that Route94 be widened to four lanes from the Wabash Freeway to Jamacha. In June1953, the Commission approved an eight-lane freeway for Route94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa. The local Board of Education also gave their approval, which was required because the freeway would be built on land that was for a proposed school. But the next month, State Senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long term. Approval extended to the junction with US80 by October 1953; [...] the part from 18th Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954. Later that year, a toll road that would have tunneled under the Laguna Mountains and bypassed Route94 was proposed by the county Board of Supervisors. The state allocated $3.48million (about $ in [...] dollars) for making SR94 a freeway from College Avenue to Campo Road in October1954.|$|E

2500|$|They {{made a list}} {{of songs}} to learn over the summer break, and Doughty landed a summer job to buy his first keyboard.

The members {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1967, and had their first rehearsal before classes even started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the REO Speed Wagon, a flatbed truck Doughty had studied in transportation history, and the initials are those of its founder Ransom E. Olds. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did, they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced ("R-E-O"). An ad in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform cover songs in campus bars, fraternity parties, and university events. The first lineup consisted of Doughty on keyboards, Gratzer on drums and vocals, Joe Matt on guitar and vocals, Mike Blair on bass and vocals.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders of the River, {{released}} in 1935, made Robeson an international movie star; but the stereotypical {{portrayal of a}} colonial African was seen as embarrassing to his stature {{as an artist and}} damaging to his reputation. The Commissioner of Nigeria to London protested the film as slanderous to his country, and Robeson thereafter became more politically conscious of his roles. He appeared in the play Stevedore at the Embassy Theatre in London in May 1935, which was favorably reviewed in The Crisis by Nancy Cunard, who concluded: [...] "Stevedore is extremely valuable in the racial–social question — it is straight from the shoulder". In early 1936, he decided to send his son <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union to shield him from racist attitudes. He then played the role of Toussaint Louverture in the eponymous play by C. L. R. James at the Westminster Theatre, and appeared in the films Song of Freedom, Show Boat, Big Fella, My Song Goes Forth, and King Solomon's Mines. In 1938, he was named by Motion Picture Herald as the 10th most popular star in British cinema.|$|E
