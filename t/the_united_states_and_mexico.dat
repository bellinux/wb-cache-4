5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico,</b> southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This expansion is ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E

In the Americas, the northern limit of its distribution reaches southern Canada east of the Great Plains, and the species extends south to the East Coast of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and beyond into Central America (Guatemala).

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that is a}} member of the genus Toxostoma, native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non-migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there is no consensus on the number. Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico,</b> but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, an {{international}} incident with Mexico {{culminated in the}} American occupation of Veracruz.

Ingram, received the Medal of Honor for actions during the occupation. The ship's detachment returned on 30 April; Arkansas remained in Mexican waters until she departed on 30 September, to return to the United States. While stationed in Veracruz, the ship was visited by Captain Franz von Papen, the German military attaché to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock, the commander of the British 4th Cruiser Squadron, on 10 May and 30 May 1914, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Once {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and {{gradually}} recovered its intensity. The {{path of the}} storm brought it close {{to the mouth of}} the Rio Grande in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August4, just aday before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90mph (145km/h)—making it close to a modern-day Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to the border between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only oneperson died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm did at least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars.|$|E

Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas.

5|$|In 1938, after {{retiring}} from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour conditions in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mexico</b> during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, Why Labour Fights. Her main wartime activity was leading {{an investigation by the}} Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as Our Towns: a Close-up; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty. Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield's other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.|$|E
