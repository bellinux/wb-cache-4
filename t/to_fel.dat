40|$|RATIONALE: IgE {{antibodies}} to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-alpha- 1, 3 -galactose (alpha-gal) {{are common in}} the southeastern United States. These antibodies, which are induced by ectoparasitic ticks, can give rise to positive skin tests or serum assays with cat extract. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between IgE {{antibodies to}} alpha-gal and asthma, and compare this with the relationship between asthma and IgE antibodies <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d 1 and other protein allergens. METHODS: Patients being investigated for recurrent anaphylaxis, angioedema, or acute urticaria underwent spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), questionnaires, and serum IgE antibody assays. The results were compared with control subjects as well as cohorts from the Emergency Department (ED) in Virginia (n= 130), northern Sweden (n= 963), and rural Kenya (n= 131). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients in Virginia with high titer IgE antibodies to alpha-gal had normal lung function, low levels of eNO, and low prevalence of asthma symptoms. Among patients in the ED and children in Kenya, there was no association between IgE antibodies to alpha-gal and asthma (odds ratios 1. 04 and 0. 75, respectively). In Sweden, IgE antibodies to cat were closely correlated with IgE antibodies <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d 1 (r= 0. 83), and to asthma (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide: i) a model of an ectoparasite-induced specific IgE response that can increase total serum IgE without creating a risk for asthma, and ii) further evidence that the main allergens that are causally related to asthma {{are those that are}} inhaled...|$|E

Allergy to cat has increased substantially {{in recent years and}} {{has been shown to be}} positively associated with asthma. We have recently shown that the mannose receptor (MR), a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells, recognizes various glycoallergens from diverse sources and is involved in promoting allergic responses to a major house dust mite allergen in vitro. Here we investigated the potential role of MR in allergic responses <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d 1, a major cat allergen. Fel d 1 binding to MR was confirmed by ELISA. Using blocking, gene silencing (siRNA) experiments, and MR knock-out (MR−/−) cells, we have demonstrated that MR plays a major role in internalization of Fel d 1 by human and mouse antigen-presenting cells. Intriguingly, unlike other glycoallergens, recognition of Fel d 1 by MR is mediated by the cysteine-rich domain, which correlates with the presence of sulfated carbohydrates in natural Fel d 1. WT and MR−/− mice were used to study the role of MR in allergic sensitization <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d 1 in vivo. MR−/− mice sensitized with cat dander extract and Fel d 1 produced significantly lower levels of total IgE, Fel d 1 -specific-IgE and IgG 1, the hallmarks of allergic response, compared with WT mice.

40|$|T cells {{control the}} {{majority}} of antigen-specific immune responses. Therefore, influencing the activation of the T-cell response in order to modify immune responsiveness is an obvious therapeutic goal. We have used a mouse model of response <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d I, the major cat protein allergen in humans, to explore the ability of peptides derived from Fel d I to inhibit T-cell-dependent immune responses to the peptides themselves and to larger polypeptides. T cells from B 6 CBAF 1 mice respond to the Fel d I peptide IPC- 2 after challenge with IPC- 2. However, subcutaneous tolerization with IPC- 2 prevents this response as measured by production of interleukins 2 and 4 and interferon gamma. Fel d I immunization of B 6 D 2 F 1 mice results in T-cell responses primarily to one peptide derived from Fel d I. Injecting this peptide in soluble form inhibits T-cell activation (as measured by interleukin 2 production) and antibody production in Fel d I-primed animals when they are subsequently challenged with peptide in adjuvant. Most of the cat-allergic human T-cell response <b>to</b> <b>Fel</b> d I is specific for two peptides on one of its two chains. Immunization of B 6 CBAF 1 mice with recombinant Fel d I chain 1 results in T-cell responses to the same peptides. Subcutaneous administration of these two peptides, which contain some, but not all, of the T-cell epitopes from Fel d I chain I, decreases the T-cell response to the entire recombinant Fel d I chain 1. The ability to tolerize T-cell responses with subcutaneous injections suggests a practical approach to treating human diseases with peptides containing T-cell epitopes...|$|E
