5|$|A {{new video}} review slot was also {{introduced}} hosted by Ball called Hit, Miss Or Maybe in which three celebrities would review {{three of the}} latest pop videos and decide whether they <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would be a hit, a miss or a maybe.|$|E
5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E
5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were not strong supporters.|$|E

5|$|I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me and I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> ought to know. Had they been wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, {{they ought to have}} hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words; I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|Later, Pete {{talks about}} his despair at the day's events with Don in the elevator, {{wondering}} how the fight occurred, when he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were all friends. Close to tears, he blurts out that he has nothing. Don doesn't respond.|$|E
60|$|But if {{they had}} only known what were Gilguerillo's <b>thoughts</b> <b>they</b> would have <b>thought</b> him madder than ever.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} to my <b>thoughts.</b> <b>They</b> WERE a damned human lot. It was an excellent word in that connection....|$|R
60|$|Now {{the reason}} and {{strength}} of this witness will lie here, that God will by the variety and crossness that their thoughts had one to another, and by the contradiction that was in them, prove them sinners and ungodly; because that, I say, sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> there was a God, sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> there was none. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> that {{he was such a}} God, and sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> of him quite contrary; sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he was worth regarding, and sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he was not; as also, sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he would be faithful, both to mercy, and justice, and sinners; and sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he would not.|$|R
5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in {{that they}} have a high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds. However, microbats use a polarity-based compass, meaning that they differentiate north from south, as opposed to birds which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate latitudes, which may be used in long-distance travel. Since microbats generally have poor eyesight, it is <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> use a magnetite-based method for orientation.|$|E
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool. Production was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans regarding Wipeout Pure, and improving on aspects where the development team <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had failed in with the predecessor. The game features sixteen licensed music tracks from techno artists, including Kraftwerk. Wipeout Pulse received positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the graphics and presentation, although some criticised the repetitiveness and hard difficulty.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} entered upon this Valley, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> heard a groaning, as of dead men, {{a very great}} groaning. <b>They</b> <b>thought,</b> also, <b>they</b> did hear words of lamentation spoken, as of some in extreme torment. These things made the boys to quake, the women also looked pale and wan; but their guide bid them be of good comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... 'These are noble <b>thoughts.</b> <b>They</b> {{make one}} burn to know more. How does Christian Science explain the spiritual {{relation}} of systematic duality to incidental reflection?' ...|$|R
60|$|The two {{exchanged}} quick glances, and then, as if {{fearful of}} betraying {{to each other}} their <b>thoughts,</b> <b>they</b> moved towards our heroine, to do the honours of the reception.|$|R
5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E
5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were getting a new magazine and put it aside {{for the real thing}} to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} its next game, Insomniac usually works on games it considers itself good at making; these focus on storytelling, creative weapons, and third-person gameplay. The company also recognizes {{the importance of}} developing new intellectual properties. The developers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were lucky {{to have the opportunity}} to develop them.|$|E

5000|$|Last thing; First thing - {{starting}} at approximately 6:20, {{this is the}} first feature played during the show. Listeners have to send in the last thing <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> about before <b>they</b> went to bed and the first thing <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> about when <b>they</b> got up. The response are read out around 6:40.|$|R
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|After Armstrong {{retired from}} NASA in 1971, he {{acted as a}} {{spokesman}} for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had a strong engineering division, plus they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America. He acted as a spokesman for U.S. businesses only.|$|E
5|$|Al-Balawi was a Jordanian {{doctor and}} {{jihadist}} website writer who was detained and interrogated over three days by the Jordanian intelligence service, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), in January 2009. The GID and the CIA <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access}} to the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. The Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E

5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and {{anti-aircraft}} guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Châtelet, en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish. After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank. Lüth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces, while the 10 survivors <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had been attacked by a British submarine. They, from her crew of 38, abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May.|$|E
5|$|Frank, now entirely across Fremont {{street and}} still walking {{at a good}} pace {{according}} to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before {{he was shot in}} the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E
