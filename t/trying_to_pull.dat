25|$|The {{story begins}} with Eustace Scrubb, who was {{introduced}} in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and his classmate Jill. They are unhappy at their school, where bullying is left uncorrected. One day they are beset by bullies, and Eustace suggests that they ask for Aslan's help. They blunder through a temporary gate and {{find themselves in a}} Unknown Place, atop an immense cliff. Jill, showing off, moves too close to the edge, and Eustace falls off <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> her back.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday, January 29, 1979, Spencer began {{shooting}} from her home at children who were waiting outside Cleveland Elementary School for principal Burton Wragg (aged 53) to open the gates. She injured eight children. Wragg was killed while {{trying to help the}} children. Custodian Mike Suchar (aged 56) was killed while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> a student to safety.

25|$|In January 1806, {{while under}} the command of Lieutenant Martin White, she {{grounded}} off Rysum, in the River Ems, East Friesland. When White went ashore to supervise attempts to pull her off, a party of Dutchmen from a schuyt landed and captured him. Manlys master, William Golding, decided to surrender her. Dutch gun-boats then captured her. The subsequent court martial stripped Golding of his rank for conduct unbecoming an officer and ordered him to serve a two-year term as a seaman. The board also reprimanded White for not having lightened Manly before <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> her off.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} story of Chang'e (Vietnamese: Hằng Nga), {{there are two other}} popular folktales {{associated}} with the festival. The first describes the legend of Cuội, whose wife accidentally urinated on a sacred banyan tree. The tree began to float towards the moon, and Cuội, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> it back down to earth, floated to the moon with it, leaving him stranded there. Every year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, children light lanterns and participate in a procession to show Cuội the way back to Earth. The other tale involves a carp who wanted to become a dragon, and as a result, worked hard throughout the year until he was able to transform himself into a dragon.|$|E
25|$|Across Guatemala, {{heavy rains}} {{associated}} with a monsoonal flow and Tropical Depression Eleven-E triggered numerous landslides across the country. Along the Inter-American Highway, 41 people were killed after consecutive landslides buried a bus and rescue workers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> survivors out of the trapped vehicle. The initial landslide killed 12 people in the bus. Hundreds of rescuers came to the site {{to try to save}} as many people as possible; however, a second landslide struck the same spot, burying hundreds of people. According to press reports, at least 41 people died along the highway and more than 100 others are believed to be dead. Throughout the country, officials stated that 30 landslides took place. One of these killed four more people after destroying their home in Quetzaltenango. Throughout the country, damage was estimated at $500million.|$|E

25|$|Admitted {{to the bar}} in 1887, Goodrich practiced law in Winchester {{and quickly}} gained {{prominence}} in Republican politics. He {{was involved in a}} variety of organizations including the Knights of Labor, the Grange Movement, Knights of Pythias, and the Republican Party. In 1897 he became chairman of the Randolph County Republican Party and was later elevated to serve as state chairman from 1901 to 1910 and a national committeeman from 1912 to 1916. His time in party leadership was difficult for him as the party was wracked by a growing internal division over various progressive agenda items. Charles W. Fairbanks was trying to lead the party to the right, while Albert J. Beveridge was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the party to the left. Despite Goodrich's attempts to heal the division, the conflict between the two men split the party in 1912, as the progressive wing left to form a new party.|$|E
25|$|Denny Hamlin {{took the}} pole {{with a new}} track record, but Brad Keselowski led the most laps. Jimmie Johnson started 20th and worked up to 5th; however, his {{progress}} was stunted by a pit-road collision with Marcos Ambrose. Other contenders Tony Stewart and Kevin Harvick were done in by a pit road speeding penalty and a flat tire, respectively. Kasey Kahne was then taken out after being forced up into the wall by Kyle Busch, causing a crash that also involved Carl Edwards. After the final restart, Keselowski picked up {{a large piece of}} debris on his grill and got passed by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> up behind the slower Danica Patrick to remove the debris. Earnhardt would continue to lead and pick up his first career victory at Pocono. The win was the fourth in a row for Hendrick Motorsports in 2014, and the fourth in a row for Hendrick at Pocono with four different drivers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997 Ford Motor City Bowl against Ole Miss, Moss {{added his}} 26th {{touchdown}} {{of the season}} on Marshall's first offensive play from scrimmage. He streaked down the right sideline and caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to tie the score at 7–7. NCAA rules at the time did not allow for statistics from bowl games to be combined with regular season stats, so the touchdown did not officially increase his season touchdown record. The two teams traded the lead {{several times in the}} fourth quarter before Ole Miss running back Deuce McAllister scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 31 seconds to play, giving them a 34–31 lead. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out a last-second win, Pennington connected with Moss on a 40-yard pass on the final play of the game, but he was stripped of the ball as time expired. Moss finished the game with 6 receptions for 173 yards.|$|E

25|$|On October 30, 2008, Artest {{received}} his first technical as a Houston Rocket, as he raced towards {{a group of}} Dallas Mavericks players and then quickly went to Yao Ming who bumped Josh Howard after play stopped. Artest was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Yao away from the play and to the foul line, but contact was made with Maverick players. The TNT broadcast crew felt this technical was not warranted, and was based upon Artest's prior reputation as a feisty player in the league. In the playoffs, Artest helped the Rockets advance past the first round {{for the first time}} in 12 seasons. In Game 2 of the second round against the Los Angeles Lakers, Artest, who was battling for rebounding position with Kobe Bryant, was elbowed in the neck by Bryant, which was later ruled to be a Type 1 flagrant foul. After being called for an offensive foul, Artest was indignant and proceeded to antagonize Bryant after the play, which eventually led to an ejection by Joe Crawford. In Game 3, Artest was again ejected in the fourth quarter after a hard foul on Pau Gasol, who was attempting to dunk on a fast-break. It was determined the next day that the foul was not serious enough to warrant an ejection, and the flagrant foul was downgraded.|$|E
25|$|HMS Guardian was a 44-gun Roebuck-class fifth-rate two-decker of the Royal Navy, later {{converted}} to carry stores. She was completed {{too late to}} take part in the American War of Independence, and instead spent several years laid up in ordinary, before finally entering service as a store and convict transport to Australia, under Lieutenant Edward Riou. Riou sailed the Guardian, loaded with provisions, animals, convicts and their overseers, to the Cape of Good Hope where he took on more supplies. Nearly two weeks after his departure on the second leg of the journey, an iceberg was sighted and Riou sent boats to collect ice to replenish his water supplies. Before he could complete the re-provisioning, a sudden change in the weather obscured the iceberg, and the Guardian collided with it while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> away. She was badly damaged and in immediate danger of sinking. The crew made frantic repair attempts but to no apparent avail. Riou eventually allowed most of the crew to take to the Guardians boats, but refused to leave his ship. Eventually through continuous work he and the remaining crew were able to navigate the ship, by now reduced to little more than a raft, back to the Cape, a nine-week voyage described as 'almost unparalleled'. Riou ran the Guardian aground to prevent her sinking, but shortly afterwards a hurricane struck the coast, wrecking her. The remains were sold the next year, in 1790.|$|E

It had been a marriage of convenience to preserve her family's fortune. In Balzac Countess Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires, with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France.

He also noted that Kills' personality, although similar to that of Pink and Lady Gaga, was [...] "enough [...] to keep your attention". Writing in Idolator, Sam Lansky highlighted Bhasker's production, which he credited with making the album cohesive. Lansky opined that Kills had evolved as a songwriter and given legitimacy and [...] "richness" [...] to Troubles songs. So So Gay Magazine praised Trouble as an evolution from her previous album Perfectionist, and stated that Kills [...] "remains largely unknown and underrated; astonishing considering the quality of her two albums. She’s definitely some sort of anti-princess of pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Up to this time, Chapman {{had enjoyed}} a {{harmonious}} {{relationship with the}} Australian crowds. However, in the match against Victoria which followed the fourth Test, the crowd barracked the MCC team when Chapman brought on Harold Larwood, a fast bowler, to bowl against Bert Ironmonger, the number eleven, a tactic regarded as unsporting. As the team returned to the pavilion, Chapman was insulted {{by members of the}} crowd {{in the midst of a}} minor scuffle. Possibly influenced by these events, he withdrew from the final Test; illness and his poor form may also have been factors. According to Lemmon, it was suggested in later years that Chapman did not play owing to his heavy drinking. In his absence, Australia won the fifth Test. After the fifth day of play and having played both his innings, Jardine left to catch a boat to India, for reasons which are unclear, and Chapman acted as his substitute in the field. Douglas notes that it looked like England [...] "were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> a fast one by picking their strongest batting side (which meant dropping Chapman) without weakening the fielding (since Chapman was Jardine's substitute)." [...] The Australians agreed to the substitution on the condition that Chapman did not field near the batsmen.|$|E

[...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks."
