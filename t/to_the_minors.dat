5|$|Smythe was an NHL owner {{during the}} era before the player's union. The NHL was only six teams and players who didn't toe the line {{could easily be}} demoted to the minor leagues and a {{replacement}} found.

5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E

To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day disabled list. He was outrighted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> on July 13. However, on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving the Rangers the option of activating him from the disabled list or releasing him. They opted to activate him off the disabled list, which re-added him to the 40-man roster.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the draft, the Texas Rangers {{held the}} second lowest {{attendance}} in the American League, ahead {{of only the}} Cleveland Indians despite having Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager at one point. They had moved from Washington, D.C., two years prior, and owner Bob Short expanded Arlington Stadium an extra 20,000 seats. Short was looking {{for some sort of}} way to boost attendance, and found it using fellow Texas native Clyde. When Clyde agreed to sign his rookie contract, part of the deal was to make his first two professional starts with the Rangers at their home field before heading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> to develop.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hawaii, Oana played five {{sports in}} high school, {{and took up}} {{baseball}} professionally after he was noticed by Ty Cobb. He spent a few seasons {{in the minor leagues}} before joining the Phillies, who sent him back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> after six games in 1934. For the next decade, he played for various minor league teams, where his Hawaiian heritage proved to be both a selling point for teams and a hindrance to him making the majors, until the outbreak of World War II. Facing a shortage of active players, the Tigers signed him, and Oana played parts of 1943 and 1945 with the team. After 1945, he was sold to the Dallas Rebels, and he finished his professional career in 1951. He later operated a lakeside fishing business until his death in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Born in New Jersey, Torres {{grew up in}} Puerto Rico before {{returning}} to the United States to attend Miami-Dade Community College. He was a track star at Miami-Dade and did not begin playing baseball until later. In 1998, he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. Torres played in their minor leagues until 2002, when he made his major league debut. In 2003, he got a chance to be the everyday center fielder for the Tigers, but after 23 games they chose to replace him. He played only three games for them in 2004 before he was outrighted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> and released upon request. In 2005, Torres resurfaced with the Texas Rangers but only appeared in eight games. He spent the next three years in the minor leagues.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets parted ways with defensemen Jan Hejda, Anton Stralman, Sami Lepisto and Mike Commodore. Hejda, who played {{four of his}} first five NHL seasons with the Blue Jackets, was offered a contract by Columbus, but felt that the organization undervalued him and left via free agency. Columbus had offered him a three-year, $7.5 million contract. He instead signed a four-year, $13 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche. Stralman and Lepisto were not given qualifying offers which made them unrestricted free agents, and both signed with other teams. Commodore had originally signed a big contract with the Blue Jackets in 2008, but fell out of favor. He was waived, sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> and eventually had his contract bought out. In order to replace the departed players, Columbus not only acquired James Wisniewski, but also signed ten-year NHL veteran Radek Martinek. Martinek played only seven games with the Blue Jackets before suffering a concussion and missing {{the remainder of the}} season. Brett Lebda was brought in to replace him.|$|E
5|$|López {{attended}} the University of Virginia, earning {{a degree in}} psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He {{began his career as}} a starting pitcher but struggled, and was converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft, but was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had {{purchased}} the minor-league Providence Grays, {{members of the}} International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, {{and as part of}} the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed him off waivers. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League pennant (league championship).|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Mayberry {{was rated}} by Baseball America as the Best Athlete and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers. In 2006 he was rated by Baseball America as the Best Power Hitter, Best Athlete, and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers, {{and was named}} a Hawaii Winter Baseball league post-season All Star. In 2007, he hit 30 home runs (tied for 11th among all minor leaguers), was named a California League mid-season All Star, and was named an Arizona Fall League Rising Star. On November 20, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies traded for him. With the Phillies, he started in Triple-A, and was called up to the major league team in May. He {{hit a home run}} in his major league debut, but was sent back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> a few weeks later, and spent the {{majority}} of the 2009 and 2010 seasons there. He was named an MiLB.com 2010 Phillies Organization All Star. He returned to the major league squad in 2010 as a September callup, and remained there, {{with the exception of a}} short stint in Triple-A in 2011. In 2011, Mayberry played over 100 games, splitting time between outfield and first base, as well as pinch hitting. Statistically, 2011 was his best major league season. He remained with the big-league club in 2012, and played predominantly in left field early in the season, and subsequently as the team's everyday center fielder. In 2012 and 2013 his batting average declined.|$|E
5|$|López served four stints with Boston in 2006. In 2007, he {{had three}} {{different}} stints but appeared in 61 games, posting a 3.10 earned run average (ERA).

In 2010, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season. He had his lowest ERA that year (2.34) and won another World Series as the Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, López was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw at least 50 innings without giving up a home run. He won his third World Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, López posted a career-best 1.83 ERA. He won his fourth World Series in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games. López announced his retirement on February 8, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Mota began spring {{training}} with the Expos in 2002, but {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers with outfielder Wilkin Ruan for pitcher Matt Herges and infielder Jorge Nunez on March 23. He failed to make the Dodgers' major league club in {{spring training}} and was assigned to the Las Vegas 51s of the triple-A Pacific Coast League to begin the season. He was called up on April 20 when Kevin Brown was placed on the disabled list. After appearing in two games, he was returned to Las Vegas on April 30 when Brown came off the disabled list. On May 17, he was called up a second time. In 22 games through July 14, he had a 2.43 ERA. On June 3, he pitched a scoreless inning and earned the win in an 11–5 victory over the Colorado Rockies. However, he was returned to Las Vegas on July 28 after he had a loss and a 13.50 ERA over his next seven games. He did not return to the Dodgers until August 26, when Kevin Beirne was demoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> That same day, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (two earned) in his third inning of work in a 12-inning 6–3 loss to Arizona. He was the losing pitcher again on September 13 when he gave up three runs in the seventh inning and blew a 4–2 lead over Colorado.

5|$|Returning to North America, Sweatt {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Vancouver Canucks on May 31, 2010. Nearly three months later, the Canucks also signed Sweatt's brother, Bill, from Colorado College. Following the pre-season, the Canucks assigned both Sweatt brothers to their AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Joining the Moose, Lee and Bill became the first pair of brothers in the team's history {{to play for the}} club at the same time. After recording 14 points in 41 AHL games, the Canucks recalled him on January 23, 2011. Filling in for injured defenseman Alex Edler, he made his NHL debut three days later against the Nashville Predators. He scored his first NHL goal that night, a game-winner in the third period against goaltender Pekka Rinne; the Canucks won the game 2–1. The following shift, he blocked a shot from Predators defenseman Shea Weber with his foot; a post-game X-ray diagnosed him with severe bruising. After resting the foot over the All-Star break, he played in two more games for the Canucks, before being reassigned to the Moose. On the morning of his scheduled flight back to Manitoba, he blocked another shot during a Canucks practice, breaking his foot. Sweatt was consequently retained on the NHL team's roster and placed on the long-term injured reserve list (injured players are not eligible to be sent down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors).</b> Unable to skate on his injured foot until mid-June, Sweatt was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The 1948–49 season saw Shero {{become a}} regular in the Rangers line up {{as well as his}} first NHL post-season action. The {{following}} season Shero set career highs in games played, assists, and points, while the Rangers qualified for the post-season in the fourth and final position. Despite being the lowest seeded team, the Rangers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals by upseting the Montreal Canadiens in the first round. In the Finals the Rangers met up with the Detroit Red Wings, and on April 23, 1950, the Rangers lost game seven in double overtime. It was the last NHL game Shero ever played. On May 14, 1951, the Rangers traded Shero to the American Hockey League's (AHL) Cleveland Barons. Upon his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors</b> Shero enjoyed team success as a player winning back-to-back Calder Cups with the Barons in 1953 and 1954. Shero was also named an AHL Second Team All-Star in 1954. However, he only played one more season with the Barons before moving to the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Winnipeg Warriors for the 1955–56 season. Shero captained the Warriors to the WHL championship, in his first season with the club. He played with the Warriors again during the 1956–57 season, but moved to the Quebec Hockey League (QHL) where he played for the Shawinigan Cataractes in 1957–58. During the 1957–58 QHL season Shero first began coaching. He served as a player/assistant coach for the Cataracts and helped them capture the QHL championship. He retired from playing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Whiteside {{attended}} Delta State University {{before being}} {{drafted in the}} sixth round of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. He played in their organization through 2007, though he only played nine games {{in the major leagues}} with the Orioles, all coming in 2005. He signed with the Minnesota Twins in 2008 but was released after playing for their Triple-A team for a month. The San Francisco Giants then signed him, assigning him to the minor leagues. He was called up to be their backup catcher in May 2009, and he caught Jonathan Sánchez's no-hitter on July 10. In 2010, he remained the backup catcher and was on the Giants' roster when they won the World Series, despite not playing any playoff games. After an injury to Buster Posey in May 2011, Whiteside split time catching with Chris Stewart {{for the rest of the}} year. He lost the role of backup to Héctor Sánchez in 2012 and appeared in just 12 games for the Giants during their second World Series-winning season in three years. Following 2012, Whiteside was claimed off waivers multiple times by different clubs before finally winding up with the Texas Rangers, who assigned him to their Triple-A team in 2013. In 2014, he competed for a spot on the Cubs' roster but was beaten out by John Baker and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minors.</b> In early 2015, Whiteside decided to retire and currently serves as a coach on the Giants.|$|E
