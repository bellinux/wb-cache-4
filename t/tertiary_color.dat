25|$|The {{national}} {{colors of}} blue, {{white and red}} {{have been used in}} national team uniforms throughout history. Most teams used a blue uniform as the dark-colored uniform, and a white uniform for light-colored uniform. Red was occasionally used as a <b>tertiary</b> <b>color.</b> In the 2002 Asian Games, the dark-colored uniform was a red one. The SBP has consistently used the blue and white uniform as dark and light uniforms, respectively. Nike has been the official outfitter of the national team ever since the SBP took over. In the 2013 Asian Championship, the color white has been used to identify the team with the fans.|$|E
2500|$|A new logo and uniforms were {{introduced}} for the 2013–14 season. Silver replaced gold as the <b>tertiary</b> <b>color,</b> while green (in a bright new shade called [...] "Victory Green", {{similar to the}} old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color.

50|$|In some {{traditional}} usage, red-violet {{is the name}} given to an intermediate or <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> that, along with yellow-orange (gold) and also green-blue (cyan), forms a color wheel triad group.

5000|$|Another {{definition}} of <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> {{is provided by}} color theorists such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are created by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange; or by intermixing complementary colors.

50|$|Most color {{wheels are}} based on three primary colors, three {{secondary}} colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as <b>tertiary</b> <b>colors,</b> {{for a total of}} 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors. Other color wheels, however, {{are based on}} the four opponent colors, and may have four or eight main colors.|$|R
50|$|In another sense, a <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> is {{obtained}} by mixing secondary-colored pigments. These three colors are russet (orange-purple), slate (purple-green), and citron (green-orange), with the corresponding three quaternary colors plum (russet-slate), sage (slate-citron), buff (citron-russet) (with olive sometimes used for either slate or citron). Beyond that are shades of grey (blue grey and brown greys), which approach but never quite reach black.|$|E

50|$|Spring {{green is}} a color {{included}} on the color wheel that is precisely halfway between cyan and green.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of color mixing: Additive and Subtractive. In both cases there are three primary colors, three {{secondary}} colors (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> made from all three primary colors. This point is a common source of confusion, as there are different sets of primary colors depending on whether you are working with additive or subtractive mixing.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> on the HSV color wheel (also {{known as}} the [...] ) {{precisely}} halfway between blue and magenta is called color wheel violet. This tone of violet—an approximation of the color violet at about 417 nanometers as plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram—is shown at right. This tone of violet is actually somewhat toward indigo assuming indigo is accepted as a separate spectrum color, usually quoted as having a range of from about 420 to 450 nanometers. Another name for this color is near violet.|$|E
5000|$|In the use by artists, red-violet is {{equivalent}} to purple, however, although the color [...] "purple" [...] is inaccurately used by many people as a synonym for violet or a color close to violet, professional artists who use the RYB color wheel generally use the term [...] "purple" [...] to specifically refer to a pigment color that {{is equivalent}} to red-violet (i.e., the <b>tertiary</b> <b>color</b> between violet and red on the RYB color wheel) {{in order to give}} themselves a larger and more balanced palette of pigments to work with.|$|E

5000|$|Viridian is a blue-green pigment, a {{hydrated}} chromium(III) oxide, {{of medium}} saturation and relatively dark in value. It is composed more of green than blue. Specifically, it {{is a dark}} shade of spring green, the color between green and cyan on the color wheel, or, in paint, a <b>tertiary</b> blue-green <b>color.</b> Viridian {{takes its name from}} the Latin viridis, meaning [...] "green".|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 36 - 39) The Omnibus Personality Inventory, Form F, by Paul Heist and George Yonge {{was administered}} to 100 college students to determine the personality characteristics of introversion-extroversion. The results were analyzed in relation to responses to color preferences. The colors consisted of the primary, secondary, and <b>tertiary</b> <b>colors</b> in full intensity. No significant differences occurred in relation to color preferences and introversion -extroversion. Combined first, second, and third choices of warm colors as preferred colors were selected by 47 percent of the introverts while 49 percent of the extroverts chose warm colors. The cool colors selected as first, second and third choices combined were preferred by 53 per cent of the introverts and 51 per cent of the extroverts. Differences were not statistically significant. Research {{of a number of}} other investigators indicated different results, showing that introverts preferred cool colors, while extroverts preferred warm colors (20 : 182). This study has shown that warm colors are more popular with the respondents than has been shown in previous studies...|$|R
