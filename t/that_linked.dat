5|$|On October 11, 1945 Justice LeBel issued {{his report}} that {{essentially}} exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} wife died in 1864, Cornelius {{remarried}} in 1866 to Missouri A. Smith. In 1872, he moved to Cornelius, which would be renamed after him, and opened a store. In addition to the store, Cornelius owned a total of , including covering three farms, a warehouse, and a sawmill. He built the Cornelius Pass Road <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the Tualatin Valley to the Columbia River. Cornelius died on June 24, 1899, {{at the age of}} 71. He was buried at the Cornelius Methodist Church Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{has a long}} {{occupational}} {{history and}} excavations have revealed evidence from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Postclassic. The causeway network <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> Calakmul with the cities of El Mirador, Nakbe and El Tintal suggest strong political links between the four cities that may have begun in the Preclassic, when both Calakmul and El Mirador were important cities, and continued into the Classic period when Calakmul itself was the most powerful city in the region. Calakmul {{was one of the}} largest and most powerful ancient cities ever uncovered in the Maya lowlands.|$|E

5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E

Johor Bahru developed at a modest rate between the First and SecondWorldWars.

5|$|While Calthrop was {{resident}} in Liverpool the Chamber of Commerce was concerned future expansion was being {{limited by the}} railway companies <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> that city with Manchester, and invited proposals for alternative methods for moving goods. Calthrop proposed a system of narrow-gauge railways linking the two cities, running along streets directly serving factories. His proposal was highly commended, but the proposed street running precluded its adoption.|$|E
5|$|Wright was remanded {{in custody}} and his trial began on 14 January 2008 at Ipswich Crown Court.

DNA and fibre evidence was presented to the court <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> Wright to the victims. He was found guilty of all five murders on 21 February 2008, and was sentenced the following day to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should never be released from prison.|$|E
5|$|After {{most of the}} Colorado River basin {{became part}} of the U.S. in 1846, the bulk of the river's course was still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19thcentury – one of which, led by John Wesley Powell, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. American explorers {{collected}} valuable information that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19thcentury, with steamboats providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> to wagon roads to the interior. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was the scene of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Czech {{units were}} held up near Skoczów and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on {{historic}} and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. The area {{was important for}} the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice-Bohumín Railway, {{which was one of}} only two railroads <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority (69.2%) of the area's population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.|$|E
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|E
5|$|NY273 {{followed}} part of {{the former}} routing of the Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike, a privately maintained highway <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the village of Whitehall to a bridge over the Poultney River near the hamlet of Hampton, where it continued to Poultney, Vermont, in the 19th century. The portion of the turnpike west of East Whitehall became part of US4 in 1927; however, US4 was realigned in the mid-1940s to follow a new, more direct highway between Whitehall and the Vermont state line at Fair Haven, Vermont. NY273 was assigned in 1949 to the path of old turnpike; however, the NY273 designation was eliminated in 1980 {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Washington County. The former routing of NY273 west of NY22A became County Route18 (CR18).|$|E

5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System also {{made it possible for}} the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation business cards that provided a website and telephone number. Upon calling the number, callers were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and maintenance man, as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E

5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, the UN Far East Air Force Bomber Command began {{a steady}} and {{increasing}} campaign against strategic North Korean logistics targets. The {{first of these}} targets was Wonsan on the east coast. Wonsan was important as a communications center <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> Vladivostok, Siberia, with North Korea by rail and sea. From it, rail lines ran to all the North Korean build-up centers. The great bulk of Russian supplies for North Korea {{in the early part}} of the war came in at Wonsan, and from the beginning it was considered a major military target. By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought to cut the flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards, would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On August 4, FEAF began B-29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea and, on August 15, light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction campaign.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of trails <b>that</b> <b>linked</b> the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E
