5|$|The thyroid hormones {{are created}} from <b>thyroglobulin.</b> This is a protein within the {{follicular}} space that is originally created within the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular space. <b>Thyroglobulin</b> contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the follicular space.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by a single layer of follicular cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the <b>thyroglobulin</b> contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in thyroid function. They {{consist of a}} rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called <b>thyroglobulin,</b> an iodinated glycoprotein.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as <b>thyroglobulin,</b> TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, <b>thyroglobulin</b> and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into <b>thyroglobulin</b> molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against <b>thyroglobulin,</b> although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{thyroperoxidase}} iodinates the tyrosyl residues of the <b>thyroglobulin</b> {{within the}} colloid. The <b>thyroglobulin</b> was synthesised in the ER of the follicular cell and secreted into the colloid.|$|E
25|$|The endocytosed vesicles fuse {{with the}} lysosomes of the {{follicular}} cell. The lysosomal enzymes cleave the T4 from the iodinated <b>thyroglobulin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Genes {{believed}} to be involved include those for <b>thyroglobulin,</b> thyrotropin receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, among others.|$|E
25|$|The genes implicated vary in {{different}} ethnic groups and the incidence is increased in people with chromosomal disorders, including Turner, Down, and Klinefelter syndromes usually associated with autoantibodies against <b>thyroglobulin</b> and thyroperoxidase. Progressive depletion of these cells as the cytotoxic immune response leads to higher degrees of primary hypothyroidism, presenting with a poverty of T3/T4 levels, and compensatory elevations of TSH.|$|E
25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE)* {{is a disease}} {{of the immune system}} characterized by the presence of antibodies to nucleic acid and/or antibodies to red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, clotting factors, and <b>thyroglobulin.</b> The disease can result in deposition of immune complexes or autoimmune disease. Immune complex deposition can cause vasculitis, meningitis, neuritis, and joint and skin disease. Autoimmune disease may result in hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, which are the most common manifestations of SLE in dogs.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Leblond {{joined the}} Laboratoire de Synthese Atomique in Paris which was {{involved}} in preparing radioactive isotopes for use in investigating the fate of various molecules in biological processes. Under the guidance of Antoine Lacassagne, Leblond injected radioiodine-128, into a rat {{and found that the}} label promptly accumulated in the thyroid gland, presumably incorporated into the thyroid hormone precursor <b>thyroglobulin.</b> To localize this label more precisely within the thyroid tissue, Leblond attempted to use the novel technique of autoradiography.|$|E
25|$|The {{thyroid gland}} may become firm, large, and lobulated in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but {{changes in the}} thyroid can also be nonpalpable. Enlargement of the thyroid is due to {{lymphocytic}} infiltration and fibrosis rather than tissue hypertrophy. Physiologically, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (also called TPOAb) and/or <b>thyroglobulin</b> cause gradual destruction of follicles in the thyroid gland. Accordingly, the disease can be detected clinically by looking for these antibodies in the blood. It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by leukocytes, mainly T-lymphocytes. A rare but serious complication is thyroid lymphoma, generally the B-cell type, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Various autoantibodies may {{be present}} against thyroid peroxidase, <b>thyroglobulin</b> and TSH receptors, {{although}} {{a small percentage of}} people may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nevertheless, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivities, recruitment of macrophages is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with Th1 axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory cytokines within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.|$|E
500|$|T3 and T4 can be {{measured}} directly. However, as the two thyroid hormones travel bound to other molecules, {{and it is the}} [...] "free" [...] component that is biologically active, free T3 and free T4 levels can {{be measured}}. T4 is preferred, because in hypothyroidism T3 levels may be normal. The ratio of bound to unbound thyroid hormones is known as the thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR). It is also possible to measure directly the main carriers of the thyroid hormones, thryoglobulin and throxine-binding globulin. <b>Thyroglobulin</b> will also be measurable in a healthy thyroid, and will increase with inflammation, and may also be used to measure the success of thyroid removal or ablation. If successful, <b>thyroglobulin</b> should be undetectable. Lastly, antibodies against components of the thyroid, particularly anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin, {{can be measured}}. These may be present in normal individuals but are highly sensitive for autoimmune-related disease.|$|E
500|$|When the {{follicular}} {{cells are}} stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, the follicular cells reabsorb <b>thyroglobulin</b> from the follicular space. The iodinated tyrosines are cleaved, forming the thyroid hormones T4, T3, DIT, MIT, and traces of reverse triiodothyronine. T3 and T4 are {{released into the}} blood. The hormones secreted from the gland are about 80–90% T4 and about 10–20% T3. Deiodinase enzymes in peripheral tissues remove the iodine from MIT and DIT and convert T4 to T3 and RT3. [...] This is {{a major source of}} both RT3 (95%) and T3 (87%) in peripheral tissues.|$|E
500|$|Iodine is {{essential}} for the production of the thyroid hormones. Iodine (I0) travels in the blood as iodide (I−), which is taken up into the follicular cells by a sodium-iodide symporter. This is an ion channel on the cell membrane which in the same action transports two sodium ions and an iodide ion into the cell. Iodide then travels from within the cell into the follicular space, through the action of pendrin, an iodide-chloride antiporter. In the follicular space, the iodide is then oxidized to iodine. This makes it more reactive, [...] and the iodine is attached to the active tyrosine units in <b>thyroglobulin</b> by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. This forms the precursors of thyroid hormones monoiodotyrosine (MIT), and diiodotyrosine (DIT).|$|E
2500|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder, {{in which the}} body produces antibodies to the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to <b>thyroglobulin</b> and to the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 may also be produced.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} {{small amounts of}} T3 directly. [...] In the follicular lumen, tyrosine residues become iodinated. This reaction requires hydrogen peroxide. Iodine bonds carbon 3 or carbon 5 of tyrosine residues of <b>thyroglobulin</b> in a process called organification of iodine. The iodination of specific tyrosines yields monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). One MIT and one DIT are enzymatically coupled to form T3. The enzyme is thyroid peroxidase.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{relatively}} non-specific symptoms of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as depression, cyclothymia, PMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and, less frequently, as erectile dysfunction [...] or [...] an anxiety disorder. On gross examination, {{there is often}} presentation of a hard goiter that is not painful to the touch; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital myxedema, depend on {{the current state of}} progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, free T4, and the anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, or TPOAb) and anti-microsomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis. Earlier assessment of the person may present with elevated levels of <b>thyroglobulin</b> owing to transient thyrotoxicosis, as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH is increased as the pituitary tries to increase production of T4 by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5000|$|Metabolism of <b>thyroglobulin</b> {{occurs in}} the liver and via thyroid gland {{recycling}} of the protein. Circulating <b>thyroglobulin</b> has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before <b>thyroglobulin</b> levels become undetectable. After <b>thyroglobulin</b> levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{present with}} {{hyperthyroidism}} {{and may be}} mistaken for Graves’ disease, if TSH receptor positive, or thyroiditis because of absent uptake on a thyroid radionuclide uptake scan due to suppression of thyroid function by exogenous thyroid hormones. Ingestion of thyroid hormone also suppresses <b>thyroglobulin</b> levels helping to differentiate thyrotoxicosis factitia from other causes of hyperthyroidism, in which serum <b>thyroglobulin</b> is elevated. Caution, however, should be exercised in interpreting <b>thyroglobulin</b> results without <b>thyroglobulin</b> antibodies, since <b>thyroglobulin</b> antibodies commonly interfere in <b>thyroglobulin</b> immunoassays causing false positive and negative results which may lead to clinical misdirection. In such cases, increased faecal thyroxine levels in thyrotoxicosis factitia may help differentiate it from other causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyroglobulin</b> {{antibodies}} {{are specific}} for <b>thyroglobulin,</b> a 660kDa matrix protein {{involved in the}} process of thyroid hormone production. They are found in 70% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 60% of idiopathic hypothyroidism, 30% of Graves' disease, a small proportion of thyroid carcinoma and 3% of normal individuals. Anti-TPO antibodies are present in 99% of cases where <b>thyroglobulin</b> antibodies are present, however only 35% of anti-TPO antibody positive cases also demonstrate <b>thyroglobulin</b> antibodies.|$|E
50|$|A {{subsequent}} {{elevation of}} the <b>thyroglobulin</b> level {{is an indication of}} recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. Hence, <b>thyroglobulin</b> levels in the blood are mainly used as a tumor marker for certain kinds of thyroid cancer (particularly papillary or follicular thyroid cancer). <b>Thyroglobulin</b> is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thyroperoxidase}} iodinates the tyrosyl residues of the <b>thyroglobulin</b> {{within the}} colloid. The <b>thyroglobulin</b> was synthesised in the ER of the follicular cell and secreted into the colloid.|$|E
50|$|Doctors may check <b>Thyroglobulin</b> Antibodies (TgAb) also, {{whenever}} a <b>thyroglobulin</b> test is performed {{to see if}} the antibody is interfering. TgAb may also be ordered in regular intervals after a person has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and just like TPOAb, it can be associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.|$|E
50|$|The thyroid hormones {{are created}} from <b>thyroglobulin.</b> This is a protein within the {{follicular}} space that is originally created within the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular space. <b>Thyroglobulin</b> contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the follicular space.|$|E
50|$|Iodinated <b>Thyroglobulin</b> binds megalin for {{endocytosis}} {{back into}} cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyroglobulin</b> {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Binding immunoglobulin protein.|$|E
50|$|Mouse {{models of}} {{autoimmune}} thyroiditis {{showed that a}} semi-mature phenotype of dendritic cells is maintained after mouse <b>thyroglobulin</b> immunization in GM-CSF treated but not control mice. IL-10 produced by T regulatory cells was important in suppressing the mouse <b>thyroglobulin</b> specific T cell response and therefore protecting against Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in mice.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the thyroid}} {{follicular}} cell, <b>thyroglobulin</b> is hydrolyzed to form thyroid hormones and mono- and diiodotyrosine. The thyroid hormones are {{released into the}} bloodstream and the iodinated tyrosines are recycled. However, the breakdown of <b>thyroglobulin</b> produces 6-7 fold more iodinated tyrosines than thyroid hormone. [...] Iodotyrosine deiodinase salvages the iodide from the deiodination of the iodinated tyrosines. Iodotyrosine deiodinase {{is located on the}} apical plasma membrane of the thyroid colloid, where mono- and diiodotyrosine are produced from this breakdown of <b>thyroglobulin.</b> Without iodotyrosine deiodinase activity, the iodide would be excreted with the amino acid tyrosine and thyroid hormone biosynthesis would be reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Organification is a {{biochemical}} process {{that takes place}} in thyroid glands. It is the incorporation of iodine into <b>thyroglobulin</b> for the production of thyroid hormone, a step done after the oxidation of iodide by peroxide.Since iodine is an inorganic compound, and is being attached to <b>thyroglobulin,</b> a protein, the process is termed as [...] "organification of iodine".|$|E
50|$|The TSH {{receptor}} {{is found}} mainly on thyroid follicular cells. Stimulation of the receptor increases T3 and T4 production and secretion. This occurs through stimulation of six steps in thyroid hormone synthesis: (1) Up-regulating {{the activity of}} the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the basolateral membrane of follicular cells, thereby increasing intracellular concentrations of iodine (iodine trapping). (2) Stimulating iodination of <b>thyroglobulin</b> in the follicular lumen, a precursor protein of thyroid hormone. (3) Stimulating the conjugation of iodinated tyrosine residues. This leads to the formation of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) that remain attached to the <b>thyroglobulin</b> protein. (4) Increased endocytocis of the iodinated <b>thyroglobulin</b> protein across the apical membrane back into the follicular cell. (5) Stimulation of proteolysis of iodinated <b>thyroglobulin</b> to form free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). (6) Secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) across the basolateral membrane of follicular cells to enter the circulation. This occurs by an unknown mechanism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyroglobulin</b> (Tg) is a 660 kDa, dimeric protein {{produced}} by the follicular cells of the thyroid and used entirely within the thyroid gland. <b>Thyroglobulin</b> protein accounts for {{approximately half of the}} protein content of the thyroid gland. Human TG is a homodimer of subunits each containing 2768 amino acids as synthesized (a short signal peptide may be removed from the N-terminus in the mature protein).|$|E
50|$|The drug acts to {{decrease}} the formation of stored thyroid hormone, as <b>thyroglobulin</b> in the thyroid gland.|$|E
