5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine.

5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass.

Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of gravity.

5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs.

It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source,</b> it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source</b> for nickel was {{the rare}} Kupfernickel. Beginning in 1824, nickel was {{obtained}} as {{a byproduct of}} cobalt blue production. The first large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production of nickel possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nitrogen fixing Paenibacillus strains were {{isolated}} from different soils on N-free media by heat shock and grown on N-free media in anaerobic condition. The cellulase positive Paenibacillus were selected {{by reduction of}} congored color on CMC medium. Three of these isolates with CMCase activities were identified as Paenibacillus strain E, H and SH. This nitrogen fixing strains with cellulase activities Paenibacillus, grow well on N-free media with sucrose or mannitol as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sources</b> of carbon and 1 produced 3. 16 and 1. 3 mM ammonium respectively. Paenibacillus strain E produced 4 u ml CMCase when it was grown on CMC as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sources</b> of carbon. This phenomena might help to plant microbe-interaction for nitrogen fixation...|$|R
5|$|The Omnem {{constitution}} at {{the beginning}} of the Digest is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of Gaius, Ulpian, Papinian and Paulus. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.|$|E

It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>source</b> for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount}} of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
