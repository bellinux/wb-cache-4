500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted me to do it for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> her to the junket – and (Depp) greeted her like an old pal when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical {{parallels}} in the book, Truman Capote, {{mentioning the}} character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered autobiographical: [...] "In my original version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man {{living in the}} house that used to leave things in the trees, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, I take the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{worked with}} a number of famous songwriters and {{producers}} during recording sessions, such as Desmond Child, Guy Chambers, Mike Elizondo, Steve Booker, Toby Gad, Tony Kanal and newcomer Ricci Riccardi. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, [...] "She was singing her songs to loops, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas." [...] He described her songs as [...] "very pop". Booker also worked on songs to show off Coyle's vocals: [...] "Because she’s got such a belting voice, I tried a couple of things where she could really belt," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the success}} of his elder brother's fledgling {{television}} commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, [...] "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!" [...] Scott said, [...] "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre." [...] He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. [...] "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> off. I had 15 years , and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Nadine {{recorded}} the album in London, Los Angeles, Malibu, and Stockholm. She {{worked with a}} number of famous songwriters and producers during recording sessions, such as Desmond Child, Guy Chambers, Mike Elizondo, Steve Booker, Toby Gad, Tony Kanal, and newcomer Ricci Riccardi. Nadine also worked with Lucie Silvas, Matchbox Twenty's Kyle Cook, William Orbit, and Tiesto. Nadine said she had sketched out most of the tracks in her London flat, before taking them to producers. Some of the original vocals, recorded in her front room, remain on the finished record. Some songs were even recorded in Nadine's en suite bathroom. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, [...] "She was singing her songs to loops, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas." [...] He described her songs as [...] "very pop". Booker also worked on songs to show off Nadine's vocals: [...] "Because she’s got such a belting voice, I tried a couple of things where she could really belt," [...] he said. Nadine herself said, [...] "We never did big, massive notes, so it was difficult to fit my style of writing on a Girls Aloud album." [...] In February 2010, Nadine revealed that she was recording extra tracks to help perfect her solo album, in order to have [...] "a lot of choices." ...|$|E
