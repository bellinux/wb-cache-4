5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> body caused <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> well did not keep <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> was, however, highly controversial. Before {{publication}} Muslim {{groups had}} expressed opposition.

By May 2006 the continuous protests had left <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> without an office. The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b> Ultimately <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> was shut down after releasing ten issues, having moved to the predominantly Hindu island Bali since its second issue, in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b> In 1917, the Tribune shut down <b>the</b> <b>magazine,</b> and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian.

The price stayed the same {{throughout}} the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways. However, the masthead for these issues indicates that <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> remained bimonthly, {{and so they are}} now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates. The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number. The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.|$|E
