40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the lift and drag of a restrained surface-piercing dihedral hydrofoil in regular head and following seas. Two velocities {{and a variety of}} wave lengths and amplitudes were used. The oscillatory lift was predicted with fair success using linearized theory as developed by Ogilvie. The experimental forces were observed to contain harmonic distortion, and comparison of the second harmonic component obtained from nonlinear quasi-steady theory indicated that the calculated values were too low. No theory was available for comparison with the oscillatory drag forces. Tests with a restrained tandem dihedral configuration in smooth water indicated that the performance ratio of the aft foil could be considerably increased for a particular separation of the foils. The optimum separation increased with increasing velocity. A brief series of tests were made in head seas using the optimum foil separation, and little difference between the <b>tandem</b> <b>foils</b> and single foil was noted for the oscillatory lift component.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} study {{is to determine the}} contour of the distorted water surface behind a hydrofoil operating at shallow depths of submergence. The effects of foil depth, Froude Number, and the angle of attack were investigated for a non-cavitating hydrofoil without any flap deflections. The characteristics of the surface depression behind a foil are important when considering the applications of canard or <b>tandem</b> <b>foil</b> systems. A theoretical analysis of the same phenomena is being made by Daniel Ai and a comparison between theory and experiment will be made in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide a {{theoretical}} basis upon which to advance and deploy novel <b>tandem</b> flapping <b>foil</b> systems for efficient marine propulsion. We put forth three key insights into <b>tandem</b> flapping <b>foil</b> hydrodynamics related to their choreography, propulsive efficiency, and unsteady loading. In particular, we propose that the performance of the aft foil depends on a new nondimensional number, s/Utau, which is the inter-foil separation s normalized by the distance that the freestream U advects in one flapping period tau. Additionally, we show how unsteady loading can be mitigated through choice of phase lag...|$|R
40|$|Grant DE-FG 02 - 94 ER 14444 was {{obtained}} from the FY 94 ARIM fund account of Energy Research. These funds were requested to address several upgrades of the Macdonald Laboratory facility. The largest item is the relocation and upgrade of the He compressor associated with providing LHe to the Nb split-ring superconducting LINAC accelerator and the superconducting CRYEBIS ion source. The move is prompted by the need to reduce the noise and vibration levels in the personnel working space in the laboratory. Several other issues related to the relocation are being addressed at the same time, such as additional electrical service and overhead crane for compressor maintenance. The Ion-Compressor Relocation Project consists of six major components. All necessary planning and engineering are completed. Many of the upgrades consist of obtaining commercially available items which are being installed by our local staff in the Macdonald Laboratory. No unexpected complications {{stand in the way of}} completing all projects within the scope, budget and time frame of the project. Of the project`s major components, the tandem resistor upgrade, <b>tandem</b> <b>foil</b> stripper upgrade, and LINAC upgrade are all complete, the CRYEBIS upgrade is partially completed and on schedule, the LHe compressor upgrade is in the early stages of development and is on schedule, and the RF electronics upgrade is in progress. (The LINAC upgrade replaces the beam scanner item. ...|$|R
40|$|The propulsive {{performance}} {{of a pair of}} <b>tandem</b> flapping <b>foils</b> is sensitively dependent on the spacing and phasing between them. Large increases in thrust and efficiency of the hind foil are possible, but the mechanisms governing these enhancements remain largely unresolved. Two-dimensional numerical simulations of <b>tandem</b> and single <b>foils</b> oscillating in heave and pitch at a Reynolds number of 7, 000 are performed over a broad and dense parameter space, allowing the effects of inter-foil spacing (S) and phasing (φ) to be investigated over a range of non-dimensional frequencies (or Strouhal number, St). Results indicate that the hind foil can produce from no thrust, to twice the thrust of a single foil depending on its spacing and phasing with respect to the fore foil, which is consistent with previous studies that were carried out over a limited parameter space. Examination of instantaneous flowfields indicate that high thrust occurs when the hind foil weaves in between the vortices that have been shed by the fore foil, and low thrust occurs when the hind foil intercepts these vortices. Contours of high thrust and minimal thrust appear as inclined bands in the S-φ parameter space and this behaviour is apparent over the entire range of Strouhal numbers considered (0. 2 ≤ St ≤ 0. 5). A novel quasi-steady model that utilises kinematics of a virtual hind foil together with data obtained from simulations of a single flapping foil shows that performance augmentation is primarily determined through modification of the instantaneous angle of attack of the hind foil by the vortex street established by the fore foil. This simple model provides estimates of thrust and efficiency for the hind foil, which is consistent with data obtained through full simulations. The limitations of the virtual hind foil method and its physical significance is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The move to high {{performance}} applications greatly increases the demand to produce large instantaneous fluid forces for high-speed maneuvering and improved power efficiency for sustained propulsion. Animals achieve remarkable feats of maneuvering and efficiency by changing their body shape to generate unsteady fluid forces. Inspired by this, we have studied {{a range of}} immersed bodies which drastically change their shape to produce fluid forces. These include relatively simple shape- changes, such as quickly changing the angle of attack of a foil to induce emergency stops {{and the use of}} <b>tandem</b> flapping <b>foils</b> to generate three times the average propulsive force of a single flapping foil. They also include more unconventional shape-changes such as high-speed retracting foil sections to power roll and dive maneuvers and the use of soft robotics to rapidly shrink the frontal area of an ellipsoid to power 68 % efficient fast-start maneuvers or even completely cancel the drag force with 91 % quasi-propulsive efficiency. These systems have been investigated with analytics, experimental measurements and immersed-boundary numerical simulations.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is to develop high quality {{intrinsic}} layers (especially nc-Si:H) for micromorph silicon tandem solar cells/modules on plastic substrates following the substrate transfer method or knows as the Helianthos procedure. Two objectives are covered in this thesis: (1) preliminary work on trial and optimization of single junction and tandem cells on glass substrate, (2) silicon film depositions on Al foil, and afterwards the characterization and development of these cells/modules on a plastic substrate. The first objective includes the development of suitable ZnO:Al TCO for nc Si:H single junction solar cells, fabrication of the aimed micromorph tandem solar cells on glass, and finally the optimization of the nc-Si:H i-layer for the depositions afterwards on Al foil. Chapter 3 addresses the improvement of texture etching of ZnO:Al by studying the HCl etching effect on ZnO:Al films sputter-deposited in a set substrate heater temperature series. With the texture-etched ZnO:Al front TCO, a single junction nc-Si:H solar cell was deposited with an initial efficiency of 8. 33 %. Chapter 4 starts with studying the light soaking and annealing effects on micromorph tandem solar cell. In the end, a highly stabilized bottom cell current limited tandem cell was made. The tandem shows an initial efficiency of 10. 2 %, and degraded only 6. 9 % after 1600 h of light soaking. In Chapter 5, the nc-Si:H i-layers were studied in 3 pressure and inter-electrode distance series. The correlations between plasma physics and the consequent i-layers’ properties are investigated. We show that the Raman crystalline ratio and porosity of the nc-Si:H layer have an interesting relation with the p•d product. By varying p and d, device quality nc-Si:H layer can be deposited at {{a high rate of}} 0. 6 nm/s. These results in fact are a very important step for the second objective. The second objective is covered by the entire Chapter 6. All silicon layers are deposited on special aluminum foils. Completed devices (including single junction a Si:H, nc-Si:H and micromorph silicon tandem cells/modules) on plastic substrates are characterized and discussed. In the end, 2. 5 cm 2 area micromorph <b>tandem</b> cells on <b>foil</b> were fabricated with an initial efficiency of the best cell to be 8. 12 % (FF = 0. 64). After 1000 h of light soaking, its efficiency and FF degraded about 15 % and 14. 2 % respectively...|$|R
