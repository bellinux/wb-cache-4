In 1845, she and Hetty Burr co-founded the Moral Reform Retreat to shelter women [...] "victims of vice". It was the only shelter for African American women in Philadelphia. The first two years alone, they housed over 200 women for periods of up to six months, providing shelter and education. The organization served the dual purpose of providing employment for the women who ran the shelter. Reckless introduced Sarah Mapps Douglass, who was from a more privileged class, to women's vulnerabilities to prostitution because of their illiteracy and lack of skills. Douglass was moved <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>funds</b> in establishing the shelter and helped Reckless and Burr teach the women skills to broaden their economic alternatives.|$|E
50|$|While {{the overall}} level of {{investment}} within the agricultural sector did not change much during the reform period, substantial changes took place in investment patterns. National leaders called for greater investment in agriculture, but actual state expenditures declined {{in the first part}} of the 1980s. Whereas communes had invested considerable sums in agriculture, the rate of investment from the newly formed economic cooperatives was far below the rate before the reform. The revitalization and extension of the rural banking system (the Agricultural Bank and rural credit cooperatives) and favorable lending policies did provide a small but steady source of investment funds for the sector. The major change, however, was that after 1978 farm families were allowed <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>funds,</b> and their investment in small tractors, rural industry, and housing was substantial. In 1983 rural households invested ¥21 billion in housing compared with ¥11 billion from state sources.|$|E

The key problem for JRI advocates, however, is that Indigenous Australians are grossly over-represented in prison populations and disadvantage in communities from where they reside requires national attention. Both countries require a clear conceptualization of JRI. Without a critical rethink, JRI might have a legacy as yet another "reform" that has failed to reduce mass incarceration...|$|E

We build our research using two-level analysis. We first look at which US LPs are more likely <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in <b>funds</b> focusing on Europe (regardless of whether a US or European fund) to identify the active global players. And second, using only the subsample of LPs <b>investing</b> in Europe-focused <b>funds,</b> we study which types of LPs are more likely to provide capital <b>to</b> European <b>funds</b> <b>investing</b> locally as opposed to US funds with a European focus. We find that LPs affiliated to institutions with facilities in Europe, such as banks and insurance companies, are more prone <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> directly in European funds. This is consistent with the transaction cost hypothesis whereby LPs may benefit from lower costs to access valuable information to screen European funds.
