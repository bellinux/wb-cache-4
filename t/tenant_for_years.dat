60|$|Upon closer {{observation}} I saw as {{we passed}} them that the buildings were deserted, and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been <b>tenanted</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> possibly <b>for</b> ages.

Payne, and [...] "Perry" [...] was his wife's maiden name. During the building's early years, its offices were occupied primarily by firms in the shipping and iron-manufacturing businesses; such companies remained its <b>tenants</b> <b>for</b> many <b>years,</b> as these industries held crucial rôles in Cleveland's industrial economy.

60|$|The {{policeman}} departed on his melancholy errand and {{the procession}} moved swiftly across the sandy beach {{and up the}} stone-paved way by which boats were dragged down the cliff to the sea. The village of Bryngelly lay to the right. It had grown away from the church, which stood dangerously {{near the edge of}} the cliff. On the further side of the church, and a little behind it, partly sheltered from the sea gales by a group of stunted firs, was the Vicarage, a low single-storied stone-roofed building, <b>tenanted</b> <b>for</b> twenty-five <b>years</b> past and more by Beatrice's father, the Rev. Joseph Granger. The best approach to it from the Bryngelly side was by the churchyard, through which the men with the stretchers were now winding, followed by the crowd of sightseers.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} Willowyard House {{dates from}} 1727 {{in the form}} of 7271 is for some unrecorded reason carved on the exterior of the house. Circa 1750 a William Simson is recorded as the owner. By the end of the 18th century Willowyards was a well established farmstead and the Edinburgh Advertiser describes it as: consisting of about 175 English acres of arable land, well enclosed and subdivided into fifteen fields, and let by one lease to three substantial <b>tenants</b> <b>for</b> 19 <b>years</b> at £130 per annum. Upon this property there is a good house, and garden stocked with fruit trees, a malt mill and an elegant court of offices newly erected. A valuable flag and stone quarry has been opened in the ground and it is believed there are both coal and limestone in it. There are about ten acres of wood and a good deal of timber on this farm; and thriving belts of planting surround the greatest part of it.|$|R
50|$|The campus, {{which is}} still owned by the City of Cumberland, was under lease to {{development}} company Ridgecrest Investments Inc, who in turn leased out space {{to a number of}} private <b>tenants</b> <b>for</b> the three <b>years</b> following the hospitals closing. The agreement between the city and Ridgecrest Investments was terminated in early 2012 due to the low percentage of the site being leased to tenants. A few months after, all tenants were told to vacate the site {{by the end of the}} year as the city works to divest itself of the property. The agreement between the city and WMHS upon the closure of the hospital does not allow the site to be use as a hospital, or any other type of facility that would compete with the services of Western Maryland Regional Medical Center.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016, it was {{reported}} that despite Trump's denouncement of Iran as a [...] "big enemy" [...] and assertions that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation charity amounted to evidence of corruption, the Trump Organization did business with one of Iran’s largest state-controlled banks from 1998 to 2003. The Trump Organization kept the bank on as a <b>tenant</b> <b>for</b> four more <b>years</b> after the United States Department of the Treasury designated the bank in 1999 as being controlled by the Iranian government. U.S. authorities also alleged that the bank had been used between 2002 and 2006 to funnel money to a unit of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution that has sponsored terrorist attacks — a period that overlapped with the time the bank rented office space from Trump.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} a tenant who signs {{an agreement to}} rent a house <b>for</b> a <b>year,</b> but moves out (and stops paying rent) after only one month. The landlord {{may be able to}} sue the <b>tenant</b> <b>for</b> breach of contract: however the landlord must mitigate damages by making a reasonable attempt to find a replacement <b>tenant</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the year. The landlord may not simply let the house lie empty for eleven months and then sue the <b>tenant</b> <b>for</b> eleven months' rent.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1980s, Bismarck {{was hit with a}} string of long-time {{business}} closures. A.W. Lucas closed not long after relocating to Gateway Mall, which was replaced with Herberger's until it too closed in 1994 upon expanding its Kirkwood Mall location. Woolworth's closed in 1985, but was quickly replaced with Dayton's. Gateway Mall took the biggest blow overall, beginning with the closing of White Mart in 1986, followed by the Herberger's closure; the latter was unable to find a stable <b>tenant</b> <b>for</b> nearly ten <b>years.</b> Kirkwood also took a severe blow in 1998 with the closure of Montgomery Ward. Other major retail closures over the years include BEST Products in 1997, and Marshall Fields (formerly Dayton's) in 2005. Although Kirkwood lost Montgomery Ward, their store vacancies only lasted a minimal amount of time. Opening I. Keating's Furniture World and many other specialty shops and restaurants displayed the city's steady business economy.|$|R
