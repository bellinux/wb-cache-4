The normality assumption on the distribution of stock returns is usually rejected in empirical studies, due to excess kurtosis and asymmetry. To model such data, we propose a comprehensive statistical approach which allows for alternative - possibly asymmetric - heavy tailed distributions without the use of large-sample approximations. The methods suggested are based on Monte Carlo test techniques. Goodness-of-fit tests are formally incorporated to ensure that the error distributions considered are empirically sustainable, from which exact confidence sets for the unknown tail area and asymmetry parameters of the stable error distribution are derived. Tests for the efficiency of the market portfolio (zero intercepts) which explicitly allow for the presence of (unknown) nuisance parameter in the stable error distribution are derived. The methods proposed are applied to monthly returns on 12 portfolios of the New York Stock Exchange over the period 1926 - 1995 (5 year subperiods). We find that stable possibly skewed distributions provide statistically significant improvement in goodness-of-fit and lead to fewer rejections of the efficiency hypothesis. capital asset pricing model, mean-variance efficiency, non-normality, multivariate linear regression, stable distribution, skewness, kurtosis, asymmetry, uniform linear hypothesis, exact test, Monte Carlo test, nuisance parameter, specification <b>test,</b> <b>diagnostics...</b>|$|E

The aerodynamic coupling of the entry-vehicle wake to parachute flow-field is under investigation to determine the cause and functional dependence of a supersonic canopy breathing phenomenon referred to as area oscillations, characteristic of DGB’s above Mach 1. 5 operation. Four percent of full-scale parachutes (0. 8 m) were constructed similar to the flight-article in material and construction techniques.

40|$|In recent years, a {{wide range}} of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> has become {{available}} for use in resource-constrained settings. Accordingly, a huge number of guidelines, performance evaluations and implementation reports have been produced. However, this wealth of information is unstructured and of uneven quality, which has made it difficult for end-users, such as clinics, laboratories and health ministries, to determine which test would be best for improving clinical care and patient outcomes in a specific context.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} exact likelihood-based {{mean-variance}} efficiency {{tests of the}} market portfolio {{in the context of}} Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), allowing for a wide class of error distributions which include normality as a special case. These tests are developed in the framework of multivariate linear regressions (MLR). It is well known, however, that despite their simple statistical structure, standard asymptotically justified MLR-based tests are unreliable. In financial econometrics, exact tests have been proposed for a few specific hypotheses [Jobson and Korkie (Journal of Financial Economics, 1982), MacKinlay (Journal of Financial Economics, 1987), Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (Econometrica, 1989), Zhou (Journal of Finance, 1993) ], most of which depend on normality. For the gaussian model, our tests correspond to Gibbons, Ross and Shanken's mean-variance efficiency tests. In non-gaussian contexts, we reconsider mean-variance efficiency tests allowing for multivariate Student-t and gaussian mixture errors. Our framework allows to cast more evidence on whether the normality assumption is too restrictive when testing the CAPM. We also propose exact multivariate diagnostic checks (including tests for multivariate GARCH and multivariate generalization of the well-known variance ratio tests) and goodness of fit tests as well as a set estimate for the intervening nuisance parameters. Our results [over five-year subperiods] show the following: (i) multivariate normality is rejected in most subperiods, (ii) residual checks reveal no significant departures from the multivariate i. i. d. assumption, and (iii) mean-variance efficiency tests of the market portfolio are not rejected as frequently once they are allowed for the possibility of non-normal errors. capital asset pricing model, CAPM, mean-variance efficiency, nonnormality, multivariate linear regression, uniform linear hypothesis, exact test, Monte Carlo test, bootstrap, nuisance parameters, specification <b>test,</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> GARCH, variance ratio test...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} several finite-sample {{specification}} tests for multivariate linear regressions (MLR) with applications to asset pricing models. We focus on departures from {{the assumption of}} i. i. d. errors assumption, at univariate and multivariate levels, with Gaussian and non-Gaussian (including Student t) errors. The univariate tests studied extend existing exact procedures by allowing for unspecified parameters in the error distributions (e. g., the degrees of freedom {{in the case of}} the Student 0 distribution). The multivariate tests are based on properly standardized multivariate residuals to ensure invariance to MLR coefficients and error covariances. We consider tests for serial correlation, tests for multivariate GARCH and sign-type tests against general dependencies and asymmetries. The procedures proposed provide exact versions of those applied in Shanken (1990) which consist in combining univariate specification tests. Specifically, we combine tests across equations using the MC test procedure to avoid Bonferroni-type bounds. Since non-Gaussian based tests are not pivotal, we apply the "maximized MC" (MMC) test method [Dufour (2002) ], where the MC p-value for the tested hypothesis (which depends on nuisance parameters) is maximized (with respect to these nuisance parameters) to control the test s significance level. The tests proposed are applied to an asset pricing model with observable risk-free rates, using monthly returns on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) portfolios over five-year subperiods from 1926 - 1995. Our empirical results reveal the following. Whereas univariate exact tests indicate significant serial correlation, asymmetries and GARCH in some equations, such effects are much less prevalent once error cross-equation covariances are accounted for. In addition, significant departures from the i. i. d. hypothesis are less evident once we allow for non-Gaussian errors.

The parachutes are tested from Mach 2 to 2. 5 over a Reynolds number (Re) range of 1 to 3 x 10 (exp 6), representative of the MSL deployment envelope. Constrained and unconstrained test configurations are investigated to quantify the effects of parachute trim, suspension line interaction, and alignment with the capsule wake. The parachute is constrained horizontally through the vent region, to measure canopy breathing and wake interaction for fixed trim angles of 0 and 10 degrees from the velocity vector. In the unconstrained configuration the parachute is permitted to trim and cone, similar to the free-flight varying its alignment relative to the entry-vehicle wake. <b>Test</b> <b>diagnostics</b> were chosen to quantify parachute performance and to provide insight into the flow field structure.
