5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> his knowledge {{that he ought to}} look away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of the}} few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, {{but he came}} to the producers' attention for his directing work on a series of party-themed Adidas commercials. Nourizadeh explained to the producers how he would want to develop the script and how he would want the film <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel, and he was eventually brought from London to Los Angeles, for what he believed would be two weeks, but stretched to two years. Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|An android is a {{humanoid}} robot or synthetic organism designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{act like a}} human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic {{humanoid robot}}s.|$|E
25|$|Edward Keating, a Pulitzer Prize winner from The New York Times, photographed a {{young boy}} {{pointing}} a toy gun outside a Middle Eastern grocery store, near a town where the FBI raided an alleged Al Qaeda cell. Other photographers at the scene claimed that Keating pointed with his own arm to show the boy which way <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> aim the gun. After the Columbia Journalism Review reported the incident, Keating {{was forced to leave}} the paper.|$|E
25|$|His father, brother, and a {{neighbour}} {{came out}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> Joseph immediately said he too {{could see the}} apparition although the adults saw nothing. The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E

25|$|Set in 2019 Los Angeles, {{the game}} {{tells the story}} of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of {{dangerous}} replicants (bioengineered androids designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> act like humans). Although several of the film's characters appear in the game, with the original actors returning to voice them, the film's protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film's soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|This {{instrument}} {{could not}} have been developed without the improvement of piston valves by Silesian oboe player Friedrich Blühmel and Heinrich Stölzel in the early 19th century. These two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented valves, though it is likely that Blühmel (or Blümel) was the inventor, and Stölzel who developed a practical instrument. They jointly applied for a patent and were granted this for a period of ten years. Later, and most importantly, François Périnet received a patent in 1838 for an improved valve which is the basis of all modern brass instrument piston valves. The first notable virtuoso player was Jean-Baptiste Arban, who studied the cornet extensively and published La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn, commonly referred to as the Arban method, in 1864. Up until the early 20th century, the trumpet and cornet coexisted in musical ensembles. Symphonic repertoire often involves separate parts for trumpet and cornet. As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in brass bands, concert bands, and in specific orchestral repertoire that requires a more mellow sound.|$|E

Kida's supervising animator, Randy Haycock, {{stated that}} Summer was very [...] "intimidating" [...] {{when he first}} met her; this {{influenced}} how he wanted Kida <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> act on screen when she meets Milo.

He also thinks of himself as Seifer's rival, despite not being the main character.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Charmed Magazine, Carpenter described Kyra as having the same sassiness as Cordelia Chase, adding that Kyra was [...] "totally evil and a lot sexier" [...] than Chase. She felt that the emphasis on sexuality was the defining aspect of the character's personality, calling her [...] "overtly sexual, coy, and kitteny". While she viewed Chase as a [...] "smartass", Carpenter defined Kyra as a [...] "temptress" [...] and a [...] "jezebel" [...] and opined that her flirtatious banter with Leo Wyatt {{was meant to be}} a part of her own agenda. She stated that the characterization of Kyra was influenced by her revealing outfit, feeling that every woman on Charmed had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> act [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "notoriously sexy".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{living in}} the countryside, Persona 4 {{characters}} were designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> sound [...] "normal" [...] and like [...] "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being [...] "more rural than was really called for". [...] "The characters aren't really ... They just happen {{to live in a}} place that's not a major metropolitan area." [...] While interviewing members of Persona 4s development team, 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have [...] "more stylish" [...] hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country. [...] "With Yosuke in particular, I gave him accessories, such as headphones and a bicycle, to make it more obvious that he was from the city." ...|$|E

500|$|The company {{gradually}} developed {{more and}} more licensed titles based on existing properties. Their partners grant them creative freedom while creating these games' gameplay. Their first licensed title is The Legend of Korra (2014), based on Nickelodeon's animated series of the same name. Published by Activision, the game's story was written by Tim Hedrick, the show writer. The game received a mixed reception when it was launched. Following The Legend of Korra is , based on Hasbro's [...] Directed by Saito, the game was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel different from previous Transformers games. The title received favorable reviews when it was released in 2015. The third licensed title, [...] was released in May 2016. According to game designer Eiro Shirahama, the team watched the TMNT animated series and also played the old TMNT games for the Super Famicom while working on the game so as to understand the universe and the characters. The game garnered mixed critical reviews when it was released.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March 2010, Gordon Brown {{appeared}} before the inquiry. In a four-hour hearing he told the inquiry that he believed the war had been [...] "right" [...] and that intelligence briefings had convinced him that Iraq was a threat that [...] "had to be dealt with". He said that his predecessor Tony Blair had kept him informed despite Blair not being aware of some developments and that the main issue which concerned him was that Iraq was in breach of UN resolutions. He feared the [...] "new world order {{we were trying to}} create would be put at risk" [...] if the international community did not act together to deal with Iraq. When asked about equipment, Brown said that British troops in Iraq had all the equipment they needed. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said, [...] "Gordon Brown's aim today appears to be <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> sound different from Tony Blair whilst simultaneously opening up no gap of substance with him and the decisions he took".|$|E
500|$|A new utility called MacroMaker was {{included}} with System 6. When enabled, it allowed users to record mouse and keyboard input as [...] "macros." [...] MacroMaker had a unique user interface, which aimed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{act like a}} tape recorder. MacroMaker was criticized for its lack of features when compared to Microsoft's AutoMac III, which was already available commercially. As MacroMaker only recorded the locations of mouse-clicks inside windows and not what was being clicked or exactly when, users soon found {{that it could not}} be used to automate more sophisticated programs. The pre-recorded clicks would miss buttons if they had moved or failed to appear upon playback. In addition, MacroMaker had limitations wherein it recorded the start and end locations of mouse movements but not the precise path of the movements, and its macros did not handle situations that required the macro to wait {{for a period of time}} before or after an action. MacroMaker was not compatible with System 7, which marked the introduction of AppleScript as an alternative.|$|E
