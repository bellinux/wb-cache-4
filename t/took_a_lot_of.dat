His debut domestic season resulted in him taking 55 first-class wickets for NBP. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> top order wickets including those of players in the national side. This strong domestic form resulted in him making his international breakthrough in the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, because it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances {{in both the}} recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward {{the end of the}} acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E
25|$|In January 1877 the Managing Committee {{decided to}} start a daily {{register}} noting animal habits and behaviour in the zoo on a day to day log book basis. Sanyal was chosen to assist three Europeans including Carl Louis Schwendler, one of the honorary governors who donated animals from his menagerie to form the zoo's nucleus. Sanyal <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> notes and referred to the existing literature of the time, mainly to T. C. Jerdon's Animals of India and Birds of India. Some of Sanyal's duties were lightened when an additional gardener was recruited during this period.|$|E

Under her leadership, the National Bureau of Statistics carried out a rebasing exercise; the first in 24 years, which saw Nigeria emerge as the largest economy in Africa. She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> heat, more-so than any other government official for the fuel subsidy removal policy by the Nigerian government which led to protests in January 2012. In May 2016, the new Nigerian administration eventually removed the fuel subsidy after it became apparent that it was unsustainable and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|After {{his victory}} in San Miguelito, Morazán's army {{increased}} in size given {{that a lot}} of voluntaries from Guatemala joined him. On 15 March, when Morazan and his army {{were on their way to}} occupy their previous positions, they were intercepted by federal troops in Las Charcas. However, Morazan had a better position and smashed the federal army. The battle field was left full of corpses, while the allies <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> prisoners and weaponry. the allies continued to recapture their old positions in San José Pinula and Aceituno, and place Guatemala City under siege once again. General Verveer, Ambassador from the King of Netherlands and Belgium before the Central American government and who was in Guatemala to negotiate the construction of a transoceanic Canal in Nicaragua, tried to mediate between the State of Guatemala and Morazán, but did not succeed. Military operations continued, with great success for the allies.|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of Simpson, Put Me Back on My Bike, William Fotheringham quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, [...] "Tom {{went on the}} [...] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things", which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson's roommate Colin Lewis. Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> chances. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days."

The band, while happy with the chorus, rebuilt the rest of the song around it; most of the song's {{original}} verses, lyrics and melody were re-written.

500|$|... "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] was {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{and is one of}} his favorite episodes that he directed. Because the segments take place in different places and time periods, the animators had to create new designs for characters and backgrounds.

500|$|Wilson {{was brought}} on board to {{continue}} rewriting work with McDowell, though Burton replaced McDowell and Wilson with Skaaren due to creative differences. Burton's original choice for Betelgeuse was Sammy Davis, Jr., but Geffen suggested Keaton. Burton was unfamiliar with Keaton's work, but was quickly convinced. Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in Lucas. O'Hara quickly signed on, while Burton claimed it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time to convince other cast members to sign, as [...] "they didn't {{know what to}} think of the weird script." ...|$|E
30|$|First, {{because each}} test image {{needs to be}} {{compared}} with all the stored training images, it <b>takes</b> up <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> storage space, consumes <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> computing resources, and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time to calculate. Because in practice, we focus on testing efficiency far higher than training efficiency. In fact, the convolution neural network {{that we want to}} learn later reaches the other extreme in this trade-off: although the training <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time, once the training is completed, the classification of new test data is very fast. Such a model is in line with the actual use of the requirements.|$|R

When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style [...] "unbelievably different... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different... That {{was a very important}} experience for me. So after that I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> courses from Hille" [...] including, in his sophomore year, graduate-level real analysis.

The mayor of Fargo at the time, Bruce Furness, later stated: [...] "We came very, very close to losing parts of Fargo...it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> effort by a lot of people—a great many of them high school and college students—to save the city.

500|$|The story [...] "A Contract with God" [...] {{drew from}} Eisner's {{feelings}} {{over the death}} at sixteen of his daughter Alice. [...] In his introduction to the 2006 edition of the book, Eisner first wrote about it and the feelings he felt toward God that were reflected in the story. [...] "The Street Singer" [...] and [...] "The Super" [...] are fiction, but sprang from Eisner's memories of people he had met in the tenements of his youth. [...] "Cookalein" [...] was the most autobiographical—the main character [...] "Willie" [...] even carries Eisner's own boyhood nickname. [...] Eisner remarked that [...] "it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> determination, a kind of courage, to write that story".|$|E
500|$|After {{starring}} in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair {{and the kind of}} blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her." [...] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst." ...|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hard work".|$|E
