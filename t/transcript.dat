5|$|The {{document}} was {{signed and dated}} at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308. At {{the top of the}} list of signatories was Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was followed by the four earls Lincoln, Pembroke, Surrey and Hereford, and five men of baronial families: Clifford, Payn Tybetot, Henry de Gray, John de Botetourt and John de Berwick. The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as a <b>transcript</b> made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale. Dugdale's <b>transcript</b> is believed to be based on an older document, which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731.|$|E
30|$|The {{responsive}} <b>transcripts</b> identified {{based on}} G test also included approximately 900 RAP <b>transcripts</b> {{which were not}} represented in the microarray as well as 28 unannotated <b>transcripts</b> revealed by the Cufflinks program (Table  2). These unsupported RAP <b>transcripts</b> and unannotated <b>transcripts</b> were classified as novel <b>transcripts</b> induced during –P and ++P stress. Approximately 6.1 % to 24.3 % (average 13.6 %) of all responsive <b>transcripts</b> were classified as novel <b>transcripts</b> in each group.|$|R
30|$|We have {{identified}} a total of 10, 388 unique unannotated <b>transcripts</b> from the root and shoot with 3, 006 <b>transcripts</b> showing homology to various proteins (Supplementary Table S 6). Among them, 28 <b>transcripts</b> {{have been found to}} be rice-specific and 303 <b>transcripts</b> showed homology to other known plant genes. The remaining unannotated <b>transcripts</b> (7, 382) without homology to any protein may include non-protein coding <b>transcripts,</b> novel protein <b>transcripts,</b> rare <b>transcripts</b> that are expressed at low copies, <b>transcripts</b> with very low expression levels, or even <b>transcripts</b> which may have lethal functions in Escherichia coli. We particularly focused on the 28 unannotated <b>transcripts,</b> which were differentially expressed under various Pi stress treatments (Supplementary Table S 4). These <b>transcripts</b> comprised less than 1 % of the responsive <b>transcripts</b> and had much lower expression levels than RAP-representative <b>transcripts</b> for all conditions. For example, the average RPKM values (±SD) for unannotated and RAP-representative <b>transcripts</b> in the root control sample were 0.8 (± 2.6) and 23.8 (± 94.5), respectively. As these <b>transcripts</b> also showed small differential expression between conditions that could not be detected by statistical tests, it maybe difficult to characterize all these <b>transcripts.</b> Two unannotated <b>transcripts</b> showed protein homology to known proteins, one to leucine family gene and another to an unknown protein. Furthermore, the presence of P 1 BS cis-acting elements was confirmed in the promoter regions of ten unannotated <b>transcripts.</b> These findings establish the utility of mRNA-Seq in identifying uncharacterized <b>transcripts</b> that are expressed in response to Pi stress.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{transcriptome}} analyses {{have revealed}} {{the existence of}} various RNA species. In our previous study, {{a large number of}} non-protein-coding RNAs including antisense <b>transcripts</b> were identified using an Arabidopsis tiling array. Most of the antisense <b>transcripts</b> exhibited co-expression with sense <b>transcripts</b> during stress treatments or seed imbibition. Here, we report that antisense <b>transcripts</b> exhibit differential expression patterns to sense <b>transcripts</b> in distinct developmental tissues. In addition, RNA ligase-mediated RACE analysis identified the existence of 5 ′-capped and -uncapped antisense <b>transcripts.</b> These observations provide additional insight into antisense <b>transcripts...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} genomic {{positions}} of 38, 129 putative ncRNAs from the RIKEN dataset {{in relation to}} protein-coding genes. We found that the dataset has 41 % sense, 6 % antisense, 24 % intronic and 29 % intergenic <b>transcripts.</b> Interestingly, 17, 678 (47 %) of the FANTOM 3 <b>transcripts</b> were found to potentially be internally primed from longer <b>transcripts.</b> The highest fraction of these <b>transcripts</b> was found among the intronic <b>transcripts</b> {{and as many as}} 77 % or 6929 intronic <b>transcripts</b> were both internally primed and unspliced. We defined a filtered subset of 8535 <b>transcripts</b> that did not overlap with protein-coding genes, did not contain ORFs longer than 100 residues and were not internally primed. This dataset contains 53 % of the FANTOM 3 <b>transcripts</b> associated to known ncRNA in RNAdb and expands previous similar efforts with 6523 novel <b>transcripts.</b> This bioinformatic filtering of the FANTOM 3 non-coding dataset has generated a lead dataset of <b>transcripts</b> without signs of being artefacts, providing a suitable dataset for investigation with hybridization-based techniques...|$|R
40|$|The anthers in flowers perform {{important}} {{functions in}} sexual reproduction. Several recent studies used microarrays to study anther transcriptomes to explore genes controlling anther development. To analyze the secretion and other {{functions of the}} tapetum, we produced transcriptomes of anthers of rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica) at six progressive developmental stages and pollen with sequencing-by-synthesis technology. The transcriptomes included at least 18, 000 unique <b>transcripts,</b> about 25 % of which had antisense <b>transcripts.</b> In silico anther-minus-pollen subtraction produced <b>transcripts</b> largely unique to the tapetum; these <b>transcripts</b> include all the reported tapetum-specific <b>transcripts</b> of orthologs in other species. The differential developmental profiles of the <b>transcripts</b> and their antisense <b>transcripts</b> signify extensive regulation of gene expression in the anther, especially the tapetum, during development. The transcriptomes were used to dissect two major cell/biochemical functions of the tapetum. First, we categorized and charted the developmental profiles of all <b>transcripts</b> encoding secretory proteins present in the cellular exterior; these <b>transcripts</b> represent about 12 % and 30 % of the those <b>transcripts</b> having more than 100 and 1, 000 <b>transcripts</b> per million, respectively. Second, we successfully selected from hundreds of <b>transcripts</b> several <b>transcripts</b> encoding potential proteins for lipid exine synthesis during early anther development. These proteins include cytochrome P 450, acyltransferases, and lipid transfer proteins in our hypothesized mechanism of exine synthesis in and export from the tapetum. Putative functioning of these proteins in exine formation is consistent with proteins and metabolites detected in the anther locule fluid obtained by micropipetting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRNA decay {{is thought}} to exert an {{important}} influence on gene expression by maintaining a steady-state level of <b>transcripts</b> and/or by eliminating aberrant <b>transcripts.</b> However, the sequence elements which control such processes have not been determined. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the <b>transcripts</b> of several genes are reported to control translational initiation by stalling ribosomes and thereby promote RNA decay. We therefore performed bioinformatic analysis of the tissue-wide expression profiles and mRNA half-life of <b>transcripts</b> containing uORFs in humans and mice to assess the relationship between RNA decay {{and the presence of}} uORFs in <b>transcripts.</b> The expression levels of <b>transcripts</b> containing uORF were markedly lower than those not containing uORF. Moreover, the half-life of the uORF-containing <b>transcripts</b> was also shorter. These results suggest that uORFs are sequence elements that down-regulate RNA <b>transcripts</b> via RNA decay mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{published in}} 2008 shows that Handkea {{may be grouped}} in a clade along with species from several other genera, including Lycoperdon, Vascellum, Morganella, Bovistella, and Calvatia.

5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} <b>transcript.</b> Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one <b>transcript</b> from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
40|$|Searching {{audio data}} can {{potentially}} be {{facilitated by the}} use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology to generate text <b>transcripts</b> which can then be easily queried. However, since current ASR technology cannot reliably generate 100 % accurate <b>transcripts,</b> additional techniques for fluid browsing and searching of the audio itself are required. We explore the impact of <b>transcripts</b> of various qualities, dichotic presentation, and time-compression on an audio search task. Results show that dichotic presentation and reasonably accurate <b>transcripts</b> can assist in the search process, but suggest that time-compression and low accuracy <b>transcripts</b> should be used carefully.

5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the <b>transcript.</b> The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E
