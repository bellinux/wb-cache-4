5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy enough for <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, {{the result of the}} contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} {{his own money}} into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E

60|$|Which playful welcome drew no {{responsive}} playfulness {{from the}} child, nor appeared to gladden or conciliate the father; but rather, if anything, to dash <b>the</b> dead <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heavy-hearted expression {{with a smile}} hypochondriacally scornful.|$|R
50|$|Mack died on 3 June 2004, aged 63. An {{obituary}} by New Zealand craft advocate Edith Ryan {{described as}} a 'very gifted, quixotic man' who 'put <b>the</b> whole <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> passion and drive behind the craft creators of this country'.|$|R
5|$|Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath, {{founder and}} Chairman of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association (MPGA), {{decided to put}} <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{organisation}} behind the campaign, and {{through a combination of}} public donations and donations from the London County Council, Corporation of London and Kyrle Society, raised the remaining £7,000 in less than six months. At this point a dispute broke out over who would be responsible for the maintenance of the park. The £5,000 offer from the Treasury was conditional upon the CPF reassigning to the Post Office the £200 annual maintenance grant that it currently gave to St Botolph's Aldersgate; the CPF maintained that it was happy to do so on condition that the Post Office maintain the park in place of St Botolph's Aldersgate, but that the Post Office was unwilling to do so. With all parties unable to agree on responsibility for maintenance, on 19 February 1898 the Treasury withdrew its offer altogether, leaving the appeal £5,000 short.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged {{the power of the}} Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfil his wishes.|$|E
50|$|Star Reporter, John Randolph (Warren Hull), {{with his}} fiancée, Barbara Burnette, (Marsha Hunt), has faith in her father, D.A.

60|$|Oh! {{it was too}} much. Under <b>the</b> {{crushing}} <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> suffering, {{his senses}} left him, and he found such peace as to-day is won {{by those who are}} about to pass beneath the surgeon's knife; the peace that but too often wakes to a livelier agony.|$|R
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
25|$|Night fell; clouds {{accumulated}} {{above the}} Baal. The funeral-pile, which was flameless now, formed a pyramid of coals {{up to his}} knees; completely red like a giant covered with blood, he looked, with his head thrown back, {{as though he were}} staggering beneath <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> intoxication.|$|E
25|$|Stambolić {{was fired}} after Communist {{officials}} in Belgrade accused him of abusing his office during the Pavlović affair. Stambolić was accused of sending a secret letter to the party Presidium, in what {{was seen as an}} attempt to misuse <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> position as Serbian President, to prevent the central committee's vote on Pavlović's expulsion from the party.|$|E
60|$|Taglat was {{no longer}} young; {{but he was still}} a {{formidable}} beast, mightily muscled, cruel, and, because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> greater experience, crafty and cunning. Too, he was of giant proportions, <b>the</b> very <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> huge bulk serving ofttimes to discount in his favor the superior agility of a younger antagonist.|$|R
60|$|Into this far-spreading {{entanglement}} Mr. Gladstone {{for several}} years threw himself with <b>the</b> whole <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> untiring tenacity and force. He plunged into masses of accounts, mastered the coil of interests and parties, studied legal intricacies, did daily battle with human unreason, and year after year carried on a voluminous correspondence.|$|R
50|$|Maughan {{encountered}} thunderstorms between Dayton and St. Joseph, but reached Saint Joseph without incident. The {{grass field}} there was soft from heavy rain, limiting <b>the</b> takeoff <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plane. Unable {{to take on}} a full load of fuel, Maughan flew to North Platte, Nebraska, where he completely filled the fuel tank, but which caused a further 20-minute delay.|$|R
25|$|Palmerston {{placed his}} trust... in the Press {{which he was}} at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper {{he knew how to}} catch and <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name and {{resources}} he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.|$|E
25|$|Kuchum {{still was}} strong and {{suddenly}} attacked Yermak in 1585 {{in the dead of}} night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River (Irtysh's tributary), but drowned under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own chain mail. Yermak's Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but every year new bands of hunters and adventurers, supported by Moscow, poured into the country. Thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all Yermak's conquests just several years later.|$|E
25|$|Aquaman is {{a fictional}} superhero {{appearing}} in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo title. During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period {{known as the}} Silver Age, he was {{a founding member of}} the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, Aquaman's character became more serious than in most previous interpretations, with storylines depicting <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role as king of Atlantis.|$|E

60|$|Mr Harding {{did go to}} him at once; {{and long}} and {{confidential}} was the consultation between the two old friends.

25|$|Re-assembly of the Chauncy Maples {{proved to}} be even more arduous than the journey—in error, the part numbers had been stamped on each section prior to the {{galvanising}} process, making the task for the African engineers even more complex. It took two years to re-assemble; the vessel was finally launched on 6 June 1901 and named after Bishop Chauncy Maples, an Anglican missionary, later Bishop of Nyasaland. Tragically while on the way to take up his duties, his boat capsized during a storm on Lake Nyasa and he drowned because of <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cassock.|$|E
25|$|Ryan soon {{showed signs}} of discontent with his {{situation}} there. In January 1859 he wrote his Provincial Superior, complaining that the expected instruction in theology was not being done and about <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> workload with the boys, being alone in this task. A reply counseling patience brought another request {{for a change of}} the situation which included a veiled hint at the possibility of his leaving the Congregation. The situation was soon remedied to his satisfaction, as his own studies were resumed and his younger brother, David, (now {{also a member of the}} Congregation) was assigned to assist him.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two months}} later, on March 4, two men {{gathering}} brush near Fredericksburg discovered the decomposing body of Carroll Jackson in a ditch. He {{had been shot}} in the back of the head. His hands were also tied behind his back. Upon recovering the body, police discovered that Carroll had been dumped over that of eighteen-month-old Janet Jackson; it was later determined that the child had been dumped alive in the ditch before her father, and had suffocated under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. On March 21, the bodies of Mildred and Susan Jackson were discovered in a forest near Annapolis, showing signs of torture and pre-mortem sexual assault.|$|E

50|$|After {{his victory}} at Montenotte, Bonaparte swung <b>the</b> main <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{offensive}} to <b>the</b> west against FML Michelangelo Colli's 21,000-strong Sardinian army. To keep Beaulieu's Austrian army from interfering, the French commander sent André Masséna's division to seize Dego to the north. On 13 April, General of Division Pierre Augereau attacked FML Giovanni di Provera's weak Austrian Auxiliary Corps east of Millesimo and defeated him.|$|R
25|$|On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger {{helicopter}} {{that had}} been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading waterbuckets from the dam {{at the time of}} the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Around 1577, Semyon Stroganov {{and other}} sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a Cossack leader called Yermak {{to protect their}} lands from the attacks of Siberian Khan Kuchum. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak {{came up with the}} idea of the {{military}} expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of Siberia. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River in a 3-day Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the steppes, and thus Yermak captured the Siberia Khanate, including its capital Qashliq near modern Tobolsk. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River (Irtysh's tributary), but drowned under <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own chain mail. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.|$|E

50|$|Lawrence Hargrave invented his box kite in 1885, and on 12 November 1894, lifted {{himself from}} the beach in Stanwell Park, New South Wales using a four box kite rig, {{attached}} to the ground by piano wire. Using this rig he lifted himself 16 feet (4.9 m) above the ground, despite <b>the</b> combined <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and <b>the</b> rig being 208 lb (94.5 kg).|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Marlborough and Eugene, {{with the}} main body of the army, had reached the river, and were engaged in getting the troops across the narrow bridges, but as yet but a small portion of the forces had crossed.
