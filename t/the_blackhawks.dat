5|$|In Chicago, Hašek {{spent time}} as the backup to Ed Belfour, and played only 25 games over two seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks,</b> {{splitting}} time between <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> and the Indianapolis Ice of the IHL. On November 6, 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by backup goaltender Jacques Cloutier that year), Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the Hartford Whalers.|$|E

5|$|Fleury {{missed the}} first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks,</b> and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks,</b> recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} Coon-Sanders moved on from <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk</b> in 1931, <b>the</b> {{broadcasts}} from <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk</b> were {{so popular that}} a telegraph machine was installed so they could take remote requests. The Coon-Sanders band {{was followed by a}} rotating crop of musicians which, over the years, included Kay Kyser, Chico Marx, Louis Prima, Ish Kabibble and many more. Mel Torme, whose first paying performance occurred at <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk</b> in 1929, became a frequent performer there.

5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé {{to have said}} that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E

5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. <b>The</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E

50|$|In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk,</b> Complete, {{also called}} <b>The</b> Complete <b>Blackhawk,</b> is a 2003 four-disc {{collection}} of the 1961 live performances of the Miles Davis Quintet at the Black Hawk nightclub in San Francisco. These sets, performed with recording in mind, forged new ground for jazz musician Miles Davis, who had never previously been recorded live in a club with his combo. Material from the four sets was first released simultaneously by Columbia Records on two albums in September 1961, titled In Person Friday Night at <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk,</b> San Francisco, Volume 1 and In Person Saturday Night at <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawk,</b> San Francisco, Volume 2.

5|$|His {{first victory}} came on March 8, 1991, in a 5–3 {{performance}} over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. During {{this time with}} <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks,</b> his goaltending coach was Vladislav Tretiak, who was selected in the 1983 draft but was barred from playing in the NHL by the Soviet government. Hašek appeared in game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, after Belfour allowed two goals on four shots in the opening 6:33, and had 21 saves. Although the Penguins won to clinch the Stanley Cup, Hašek's performance {{attracted the attention of}} the Sabres, who had considered trading for him earlier that season.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–06 season, rookies Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby {{began their}} careers. In their first three seasons, they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies; Crosby in 2007, and Ovechkin in 2008. The {{success of the}} Heritage Classic led to the {{scheduling}} of more outdoor games. The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 at Wrigley Field in Chicago between <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> and Red Wings. The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers. The home team Bruins won.|$|E
5|$|Raymond had a {{quick start}} to {{his second season}} in 2008–09, scoring 10 points in his first 13 games, but trailed off to add just 13 points for the {{remainder}} of the campaign. Midway through the season, he was named to the 2009 YoungStars Game in Montreal, helping the sophomores beat the rookie team 9–5. He finished his second NHL season with 11 goals and 12 assists in 72 games. In the ensuing 2009 playoffs, where the Canucks entered as the third seed in the Western Conference, Raymond scored his first NHL post-season goal in game three of the second round against the Chicago Blackhawks, a 3–1 win for the Canucks.

5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blackhawks,</b> {{known as}} the Black Hawks from their {{inception}} until 1986, have won the Stanley Cup six times in their 83-year history. Charlie Gardiner, the team's goaltender for its first Stanley Cup win in 1934, became the first European-born captain—and still the only goaltender captain—to win the Stanley Cup. Johnny Gottselig became the second European-born captain to do so when the team won its second championship in 1938. Stan Mikita is the franchise leader in assists (926) and points (1467), and Bobby Hull is the leader in goals (604). Chris Chelios is the franchise leader in penalty minutes (1495). Goaltender Tony Esposito is the club's all-time leader in wins (873) and shutouts (74).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Edler {{improved to}} career-highs of 37 assists, first among team defensemen, and 42 points, second to Christian Ehrhoff.

5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles. However, they were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the playoffs each time. The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively. In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks.</b> In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. The low point came in the 1997–98 season, in which the Flames finished with only 67 points, the second-lowest point total in franchise history (behind only the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames).|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{entered the}} final game of the regular season, on 10 April against the Calgary Flames, one point behind Alexander Ovechkin for the NHL scoring lead. In a pre-game ceremony, he was awarded the Canucks' Cyclone Taylor Trophy, Cyrus H. McLean Trophy and Molson Cup as the team's most {{valuable}} player, leading scorer and three-star selection leader, respectively. He then went on to record four assists in a 7–3 win to finish the season with 112points, passing Ovechkin for the season lead, while also breaking Pavel Bure's franchise record of 110points, set in 1992–93. Ovechkin failed to register a point in his last game the next day, earning Henrik the League scoring title and making him the first Art Ross Trophy winner in Canucks history. With a League-leading 83assists, he also surpassed his own team record of 71assists in one season. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Henrik added 14 points in 12 games. He scored the winning goal in game four against the Los Angeles Kings with under three minutes to go in regulation to tie the series at two games each.

5|$|Kesler {{completed}} the 2009–10 campaign {{with a new}} personal best in points {{for the third consecutive}} season with 75 points (25 goals and 50 assists). With the Sundin's retirement and Demitra being held out of the lineup with injuries, he was moved to his natural center position and joined by wingers Mikael Samuelsson and Mason Raymond. His 26 power play points ranked second on the team to Henrik Sedin. Playing on the second power play unit, he earned many of his points controlling the puck along the half-boards. He also averaged a career-high 19:37 minutes of ice time per game, which ranked second among team forwards to Henrik Sedin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Kesler notched a goal and nine assists in 12 games. After helping the Canucks eliminate the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, he played with a sore shoulder in the second round, as Vancouver were eliminated by <b>the</b> <b>Blackhawks</b> for the second consecutive year. An MRI did not reveal any serious injury. He admitted following the defeat to not having played his best during the playoffs.|$|E
