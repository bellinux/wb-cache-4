40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of India''s <b>tax</b> system on growth, through the level and {{productivity}} of private investment. Comparison of India''s indicators of effective <b>tax</b> rates and <b>tax</b> revenue productivity with other countries shows that the Indian <b>tax</b> system is characterized by: (1) a high dependence on indirect <b>taxes,</b> (2) low average effective <b>tax</b> rates and <b>tax</b> productivity, and (3) high marginal effective <b>tax</b> rates and large tax-induced distortions on investment and financing decisions.

Though Congress had adopted much of Hamilton's earlier proposals, his manufacturing proposals fell flat, even in the more-industrialized North, as merchant-shipowners had a stake in free trade.

In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption.
