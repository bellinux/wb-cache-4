5|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, {{officials}} at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon's depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve more into the teen pop and R genres, as she felt that restyling herself to match <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, {{most of whom were}} disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and cracking the top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E

25|$|In later stories, Lamia was cursed {{with the}} {{inability}} to close her eyes {{so that she would}} always obsess over <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dead children. Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children. Myths variously describe Lamia's monstrous (occasionally serpentine) appearance as a result of either Hera's wrath, the pain of grief, the madness that drove her to murder, or—in some rare versions—a natural result of being Hecate's daughter.|$|E
25|$|Téchiné's {{demonstrated}} his {{flair for}} richly textured, atmospheric storytelling with his next film, the aptly titled thriller Barocco (1976), a crime drama, rooted in expressionist surrealism. A boxer who has accepted {{and then turned}} down a huge bribe from a politician to tell a lie that will influence an election is killed by a hired assassin. The boxer's girlfriend eventually {{falls in love with}} the killer while trying to remake him into <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> slain lover. The film elicited critical plaudits for its elegant look.|$|E
25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes {{so that she would}} always obsess over <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E

The man relays an unknown message to Gemma’s mother about a woman named Circe, and Gemma's mother panics and demands that Gemma return home. Becoming angry at her mother’s secrecy, Gemma runs away, and has a vision <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother committing suicide while searching for her, which she later learns is true.

500|$|During her dialogues {{while walking}} to the gallows, or {{standing}} on the ladder under the hanging tree, Dyer exchanged a series of [...] "yeas" [...] and [...] "nays" [...] with her detractors. [...] With these affirmations and negations she was refusing to allow others to construct her meaning. [...] She refuted <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a sinner in need of repentance, and contested {{the authority of the}} elders of the church. [...] Just like Hutchinson's befuddling of her accusers during her civil trial, Dyer did not allow her interrogators to feel assured in how they framed her meaning.|$|E
500|$|Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson: Bond Girl and Goldfinger's aide-de-camp, whom Bond catches {{helping the}} villain cheat at {{a game of}} cards. He seduces her, but for her betrayal, she is {{completely}} painted in gold paint and dies from [...] "skin suffocation" [...] (a common medical belief in the 1960s, but the skin's contribution to total respiration is negligible). Eaton was sent by her agent to meet Harry Saltzman and agreed to take the part if the nudity was done tastefully. It took an hour-and-a-half to apply the paint to her body. Although {{only a small part}} in the film, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> painted gold was renowned and Eaton appeared on the cover of Life magazine on 6 November 1964.|$|E
500|$|From 1987, a {{conglomerate}} of 14 {{political parties}} began working {{together in the}} hope of defeating the Sandinistas should an election come about. By 1989, efforts by Costa Rican President Óscar Arias and other Central American leaders had persuaded Ortega to hold elections. He agreed not only to free elections, but to the monitoring of the process. The conglomerate of opposition, now calling itself the National Opposition Union ( [...] , UNO) agreed upon a formula to select a consensus candidate. After five rounds of voting, Chamorro was appointed the presidential candidate for UNO. Her platform primarily consisted of two key promises: ending the civil war and ending mandatory military service. It also played heavily on her simplicity, her faith, common sense, and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> being the [...] "queen-mother" [...] and the wife of a martyr.|$|E
25|$|Despite all the {{publicity}} she received, Cliff was actually quite camera shy, {{and in most cases}} <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pottery were what dominated the women's magazine of the day. One picture which shows Cliff informally was taken when a South African stockist <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ware, from Werner Brothers, visited the factory on a buying trip. Cliff is seen with the 3-year-old daughter and wife of the stockist. After the visit Cliff sent the daughter a present of a miniature child's tea set painted in her Honolulu pattern.|$|R

500|$|Shabazz {{began to}} accept {{speaking}} engagements at colleges and universities. She often {{spoke about the}} black nationalist philosophy of MalcolmX, but she also spoke about {{her role as a}} wife and mother. Shabazz felt that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband projected by the media were misrepresentations. [...] "They attempted to promote him as a violent person, a hater of whites," [...] she explained. [...] "He was a sensitive man, a very understanding person and yes, he disliked the behavior of some whites.... He had a reality-based agenda." ...|$|R
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny {{that she was the}} power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E
500|$|Blandine and Cosima were {{subjected}} to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: [...] "Above all, Patersi taught her how a 'noble lady' must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, {{his first visit to}} his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as [...] "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.|$|E
500|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica's {{changing}} entries on Austen illustrate her increasing {{popularity and}} status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as [...] "an elegant novelist" [...] while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as [...] "one {{of the most}} distinguished modern British novelists". Around {{the start of the}} 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the Memoir and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in Harper's Magazine, that of [...] "dear aunt Jane". Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as [...] "Austenolatry"—it was only after the publication of the Memoir that readers developed a personal connection with Austen. However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as Janeites to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2006, {{she wrote}} a heart-wrenching anthem 'Lahu Lahu Lebanon' (Lebanon under blood) for her {{campaign}} to support Lebanese victims in 2006 Lebanon War, also called 'the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War'. The lyrics were deep and sad. Her anthem was telecasted on many TV channels but then its telecast was stopped after criticism because <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> video made masses tremble with fear. She refused to change the video by saying that [...] "this is reality which is happening unfortunately. Go and stop the violence, don't stop my video." ...|$|R

500|$|The song starts {{just when}} Azalea starts {{chopping}} the lettuce. Azalea's dream starts, {{in which she}} can be seen with Ora in a snowy scene, both dressed in similar jumpsuits with a [...] "Black Widow" [...] on each of their backs. When the scene changes, Azalea is training with an older Japanese man, followed by her intercepting a poison dart. She opens the dart to find an image of Madsen with the word [...] "Destroy" [...] written on it. Meanwhile, Ora is playing poker in an underground casino alongside Paul Sorvino and rapper T.I. and wins {{a large amount of}} money. Following this Sorvino becomes upset and aggressive, and Ora kicks him to the ground. As Sorvino lies motionless on the ground, Ora receives a Wickr message with <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> next target - Madsen. She and Azalea both ride motorcycles to Madsen's club. Azalea unsheathes her katana and strides towards Madsen as the terrified club patrons flee. Madsen summons his guards to attack Azalea but Ora arrives as her backup, and the pair defeat the guards. They then confront Madsen who draws a gun on them, but before he can shoot them he is bitten by a black widow spider and dies.|$|E
2500|$|Melba {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the Melbourne Conservatorium, and this institution was renamed the Melba Memorial Conservatorium of Music in her honour in 1956. The music hall at the University of Melbourne is known as Melba Hall. The Canberra suburb of Melba is named after her. The Australian $100 note features <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face, and her likeness has also appeared on an Australian stamp. Sydney Town Hall has a marble relief bearing the inscription [...] "Remember Melba", unveiled during a World War II charity concert in memory of Melba and her First World War charity work and patriotic concerts. A tunnel on Melbourne's EastLink freeway is named in her honour.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} Second World War in Europe, Göring retreated to his {{mountain}} home at Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, taking Emmy and Edda with him. On 8 May 1945, Germany surrendered unconditionally, and on 21 May, {{a few days before}} her seventh birthday, Edda was interned with her mother in the U.S.-controlled Palace Hotel, code-named Camp Ashcan, at Mondorf, in Luxembourg. By 1946, the two had been freed and were living at one of their own houses, Burg Veldenstein, in Neuhaus, near Nuremberg. There they were visited by the American officer John E. Dolibois, who described Edda as, [...] "a beautiful child, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father. Bright and perky, polite and well-trained". During the Nuremberg trials, Edda was allowed to visit her father in prison. He was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death, but on 15 October 1946, the night before his scheduled execution, Göring committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to photography, van Ree makes short films {{and works in}} other visual media, including painting and pencil drawings. In her drawings, she finds inspiration in her dreams, and has undertaken drawing {{as an attempt to}} give <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dreams tangibility. This dream-drawing, according to Van Ree, also creates a sense <b>of</b> familiarity with <b>her</b> waking life. She also has designed text-based T-shirts, which she calls [...] "DieWilder" [...] and wears herself in public appearances. In August 2015, Van Ree contributed a poem to the [...] "A Letter to My Younger Self" [...] series on the blog for the fashion and home decor online store, The Dreslyn.|$|R
2500|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{challenged}} the prevailing morals of the Victorian era. [...] Especially shocking was Helen's slamming {{of her bedroom}} door {{in the face of}} her husband after continuing abuse. Charles Kingsley, in his review for Fraser's Magazine wrote: [...] "A people's novel of a very different school is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. [...] It is, taken altogether, a powerful and an interesting book. [...] Not that it is a pleasant book to read, nor, as we fancy, has it been a pleasant book to write; still less has it been a pleasant training which could teach an author such awful facts, or give courage to write them. [...] The fault of the book is coarseness--not merely that coarseness of subject which will be the stumbling-block of most readers, and which makes it utterly unfit to be put into the hands of girls..." [...] Despite this, he believed that: [...] " [...] society owes thanks, not sneers, to those who dare to shew her <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own ugly, hypocritical visage".|$|E
2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of 'Beleaguered Cities' (1929) in various mid-twentieth century anthologies of English verse made it probably Lucas's best-known poem. Others that have gained currency through anthologies include 'The Destined Hour' (1953), a re-telling in verse {{of the old}} 'appointment in Samarra' fable, and 'Spain 1809', {{the story of a}} village woman's courage during the French occupation in the Peninsular War. His most ambitious poem was Ariadne (1932), an epic re-working of the Labyrinth myth, extracts from which were read on the BBC Home Service in 1934. Simon Tidworth in The Quest for Theseus summarises: [...] "Lucas invents another sweetheart for Theseus, Aegle, one of the sacrificial maidens who accompany him to Crete. [...] The real stroke of originality is to make the Minotaur Minos himself in a bull-mask. [...] On Naxos Ariadne learns of Theseus's earlier love for Aegle, and decides to leave him while <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own love is still fresh. An ordinary love-affair is not what she wants; she has to seek the Ideal [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Her 1977 {{appearance}} {{on the cover of}} Time magazine under the banner [...] "Torchy Rock" [...] was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear, Ronstadt hated <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> that was projected to the world on that cover, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image {{she did not want to}} project. In 2004, she was interviewed for CBS This Morning and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, [...] "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her Svengali. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about." [...] Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a [...] "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold". Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the Time cover did not appear to help the situation.|$|E

After all, she was demeaning herself shamefully staying with them in common, sordid lodgings. After all, she had been bred up {{differently}} from that. They had horribly low standards--such low standards--not only of morality, but of life altogether. Really, she had come down in the world, conforming to such standards of life.
