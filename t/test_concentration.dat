5000|$|There are {{two main}} ways to {{approach}} this. [...] "Spotting" [...] involves placing a sample directly onto an agarose gel or plastic wrap. The fluorescent dye is either present in the agarose gel, or is added in appropriate concentrations to the samples on the plastic film. A set of samples with known concentrations are spotted alongside the sample. The concentration of the unknown sample is then estimated by comparison with the fluorescence of these known concentrations. Alternatively, one may run the sample through an agarose or polyacrylamide gel, alongside some samples of known concentration.

Because there is no leak of substances in the system, the amount of helium remains constant during the test, and the FRC is calculated by using the following equation: ...|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that whereas the diluted filtrate had little toxicity, diluted unfiltered dispersions were toxic. This apparent contradiction reflects differences in the way samples below the highest <b>test</b> <b>concentration</b> were prepared. Each TiO 2 dispersion was prepared separately from powder, and the shape of the saturation curve (see Figs. 3 and 4) suggests there was a surplus of the smaller nanoparticles responsible for toxicity. In contrast, the diluted filtrates were prepared by serially diluting the sample with the highest <b>test</b> <b>concentration,</b> resulting in a concomitant reduction in the concentration of smaller, more toxic nanoparticles. It is also possible that further agglomeration of particles in the dispersion samples may have contributed to the discrepancy.|$|E
40|$|Background: Linalool is {{a widely}} used {{fragrance}} terpene. Pure linalool is not allergenic or a very weak allergen, but autoxidizes on air exposure and the oxidation products can cause contact allergy. Oxidized (ox.) linalool has previously been patch tested at a concentration of 2. 0 % in petrolatum (pet.) in 1511 patients, and 1. 3 % positive patch test reactions were observed. Objective: To investigate the optimal patch <b>test</b> <b>concentration</b> for detection of contact allergy to ox. linalool. Methods: Four concentrations of ox. linalool (2. 0 %, 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, 11. 0 % pet.) were tested in 3418 consecutive dermatitis patients. Results: Ox. linalool 2. 0 %, 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, and 11. 0 % pet. detected positive patch test reactions in 0. 83 %, 3. 2 %, 5. 3 %, and 7. 2 % of the tested patients, respectively. The doubtful reactions increased with rising concentrations but relatively less, giving 5. 1 %, 6. 4 %, and 7. 3 % doubtful reactions, respectively, for ox. linalool 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, and 11. 0 % pet. Few irritative reactions were seen. Conclusions: Raising the patch <b>test</b> <b>concentration</b> for ox. linalool gave a better detection of contact allergy, as many as 5 - 7 % positive patch test reactions were detected. We suggest a patch <b>test</b> <b>concentration</b> of ox. linalool 6. 0 % pet. for future patch testing, giving a dose per unit area of 2. 4 mg/cm(2) when 20 mg test substance is tested in small Finn Chambers (R) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{justification}} {{is generally}} provided for selection of {{in vitro assay}} <b>testing</b> <b>concentrations</b> for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Selection of concentration levels for hazard evaluation based on real-world exposure scenarios is desirable. Objectives: Our goal is to use estimates of lung deposition following occupational exposure to nanomaterials to recommend in vitro <b>testing</b> <b>concentrations</b> for the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ToxCastTM program. We provide <b>testing</b> <b>concentrations</b> for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles. Methods: We reviewed published ENM concentrations measured in air in manufacturing and R&D labs to identify input levels for estimating ENM mass retained in the human lung using the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD) model. Model input parameters were individually varied to estimate alveolar mass retained for different particle sizes (5 - 1000 nm), aerosol concentrations (0. 1, 1 mg/m 3), aspect ratios (2, 4, 10, 167), and exposure durations (24 hours and a working lifetime). The calculated lung surface concentrations were then converted to in vitro solution concentrations. Results: Modeled alveolar mass retained after 24 hours is most affected by activity level and aerosol concentration. Alveolar retention for Ag and TiO 2 nanoparticles and CNTs for a working lifetime (45 years) exposure duration is similar to high-end concentrations (30 - 400 μg/mL) typical of in vitro testing reported in the literature. Conclusions: Analyses performed are generally applicable to provide ENM <b>testing</b> <b>concentrations</b> for in vitro hazard screening studies though {{further research is needed}} to improve the approach.

30|$|In several {{terrestrial}} {{and aquatic}} tests with various ENMs, a plateau {{with a maximum}} effect below 100  % is observed instead of concentration–effect relationships with a maximum of 100  % effect [23, 24].

30|$|For {{tests in}} aqueous media, the {{nanoparticle}} {{concentration in the}} dispersion affects {{the size of the}} resulting agglomerates, which reduces the toxicity of the nanoparticles[29, 30]. Tests using Caenorhabditis elegans on agar plates resulted in the steady-state inhibition of survival despite the increasing <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Ag nanoparticles[31]. Therefore, we propose that the statistically-significant but concentration-independent effects of nanoparticle dispersions we observed reflect the comparable bioavailability of nanoparticles with different total concentrations due to the agglomeration behavior of nanoparticles in the stock preparation. We tested the two nanoparticle concentrations (10 and 20 mg/L) based on different stock suspensions (100 and 200 mg/L) and observed ecotoxicological effects on plants, earthworms and nitrogen-transforming microorganisms. We observed statistically-significant differences between experimental and control vessels in terms of plant growth and earthworm reproduction, although the mean values of the relevant parameters (plant fresh weight, number of juvenile earthworms) did not correspond to the differing concentrations. For example, the higher <b>test</b> <b>concentrations</b> had a lower impact on plant biomass, and the number of juvenile earthworms was similar at both <b>test</b> <b>concentrations.</b> It is possible that concentration-effect relationships could be revealed by repeating the <b>tests</b> at lower <b>concentrations</b> based on less-concentrated stock suspensions.|$|R
