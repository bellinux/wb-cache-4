50|$|Overdriving a {{fluorescent}} lamp {{is a method}} of getting more light from each tube than is obtained under rated conditions. ODNO (Overdriven Normal Output) fluorescent tubes are generally used when there isn't enough room to put in more bulbs to increase the light. The method is effective, but generates some additional issues. This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost-effective way to add more light to their aquariums. While power compact fluorescent lights cost upwards of $60-100 in the US, a <b>twin</b> <b>bulb</b> overdriven lamp {{can be set up}} for $30.|$|E
5000|$|Series 400 and 600 Aurea {{vehicles}} contain single bulb headlight arrangements {{similar in}} style {{to that of}} German [...] "Bosch" [...] brand shape, and contain the cast word [...] "Aurea" [...] at the top front of the headlights cast aluminium bezel. Series 600 vehicles contain a rarer <b>twin</b> <b>bulb</b> headlight, similar to Bosch Lancia Lambda style, but are of the Italian [...] "Carello" [...] brand and are all-brass with a unique Carello headlight glass. The taillight assembly is a cylindrical type and similar, but {{not the same as}} FIAT vehicles.

40|$|AbstractEndemic Muscari muscarimi Medikus is {{the most}} {{fragrant}} plant among Muscari species and has a high ornamental potential. The natural populations of M. muscarimi, are severely affected by increased environmental pollution and urbanization. There {{is a need to}} develop a micropropagation method that should serve effectively for commercial propagation and conservation. Therefore, the study targeted to set up a strategy for efficient in vitro bulblet regeneration system of M. muscarimi using twin scale bulb explants on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 4. 44, 8. 88, 17. 76 μM BAP (6 -Benzylaminopurine) plus 2. 685, 5. 37, 10. 74 μM NAA (α-Naphthalene acetic acid). Maximum number of 19 daughter axillary bulblets and 16 daughter adventitious bulblets per <b>twin</b> <b>bulb</b> scale explant was regenerated on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 17. 76 μM BAP plus 10. 74 μM NAA and 17. 76 μM BAP plus 2. 685 μM NAA respectively. The daughter bulblets regenerated on <b>twin</b> <b>bulb</b> scales on 8 out of 9 regeneration treatment could be easily rooted on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 4. 9 μM IBA (Indole- 3 -butyric acid). The daughter bulblets regenerated on 9 th treatment (1. 0 ×MS medium containing 17. 76 μM BAP plus 10. 74 μM NAA) were transferred to 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose to break negative carry over effect of this dose of BAP–NAA, where they grew 2 – 3 roots of variable length. Daughter bulblet diameter was increased by culturing them on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 4. 44 μM BAP plus 5. 37 μM NAA. The results verified that both age and the source of explants had significant effect on regeneration. In another set of experiments, twin scales were obtained from in vitro regenerated daughter bulblets, although they induced bulblets, yet their bulblet regeneration percentage, mean number of bulblets per explant and their diameter were significantly reduced. In vitro regenerated bulblets were acclimatized in growth chamber under ambient conditions of temperature and humidity on peat moss, where they flowered. The study provides important information about selection of suitable micropropagation medium, strategies to improve bulblet diameter and rooting of M. muscarimi which offers a scope for commercial propagation...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the genetic {{variation}} among local varieties of onion in Iran, an experiment was conducted in the Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Tabriz University. Sixteen populations were evaluated for agronomic characteristics and also total seed proteins via SDS-PAGE. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used to group the onion populations under study.  Analysis of variance showed significant differences among varieties for leaf color, leaf length, texture tightness, onion yield per plant, and number of edible layers. No significant differences were observed {{for the number of}} <b>twin</b> onions, <b>bulb</b> diameter, and onion dry weight. Hamadan (98 - 148), Arak (98 - 95, 98 - 96, 98 - 97, 98 - 103), and Zanjan (98 - 223) populations acquired the highest onion yield per plant. The significant differences between populations for the majority of characteristics proved the existence of genetic variation in the Iranian onion germplasm. The results from cluster analysis for agronomic characteristics were the same as those from the cluster analysis for the onion yield per plant. The 16 populations were divided into 4 groups. Cluster analysis for the electrophoresis banding pattern resulted in two groups, which was not similar to the dendrogram of agronomic traits. Using principal component analysis, the first principal components determined 97. 57 % of the total variation. Onion yield per plant was the most important trait in the first principal component and onion dry weight was the second trait in the rank...|$|R
