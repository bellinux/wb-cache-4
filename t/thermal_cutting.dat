The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>cutting</b> methods, are {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} metal parts. <b>Thermal</b> <b>cutting</b> processes separate materials by using heat. The process can be done with or without a stream of cutting oxygen. Common processes are Oxygen, plasma and laser cutting. It depends on the application and material which cutting method is used. Numerically-controlled <b>thermal</b> <b>cutting</b> is a cost-effective way of prefabricating components. One design aim is to minimize the number of work steps in order to increase competitiveness. This has resulted in the holes and openings in plate parts manufactured today being made using <b>thermal</b> <b>cutting</b> methods. This is a problem from the fatigue life perspective because there is local detail in the as-welded state that causes a rise in stress in a local area of the plate. In a case where the static utilization of a net section is full used, the calculated linear local stresses and stress ranges are often over 2 times the material yield strength. The shakedown criteria are exceeded. Fatigue life assessment of flame-cut details is commonly based on the nominal stress method. For welded details, design standards and instructions provide more accurate and flexible methods, e. g. a hot-spot method, but these methods are not universally applied to flame cut edges. Some of the fatigue tests of flame cut edges in the laboratory indicated that fatigue life estimations based on the standard nominal stress method can give quite a conservative fatigue life estimate in cases where a high notch factor was present. This is an undesirable phenomenon and it limits the potential for minimizing structure size and total costs. A new calculation method is introduced to improve the accuracy of the theoretical fatigue life prediction method of a flame cut edge with a high stress concentration factor. Simple equations were derived by using laboratory fatigue test results, which are published in this work. The proposed method is called the modified FAT method (FATmod). The method takes into account the residual stress state, surface quality, material strength class and true stress ratio in the critical place...|$|E

Numerous approaches have been proposed to model metal cutting forces with various degrees of success. In addition {{to the effect of}} workpiece materials, cutting parameters, and process configurations, <b>cutting</b> tool <b>thermal</b> properties can also contribute to the level of cutting forces. For example, a difference has been observed for cutting forces between the use of high and low CBN content tools under identical cutting conditions.

The model prediction is compared to the published experimental process data of hard turning AISI H 13 steel (52 HRc) using either low CBN content or high CBN content tools.
