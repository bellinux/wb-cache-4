Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is always seen wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> the bright side of things {{even in the face}} of certain disaster. He is also a fan of self help speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E

60|$|Slowly and mournfully the {{sentinel}} at the rifted wall {{raised his}} eyes towards the eastern clouds as they brightened before the advancing dawn. Desolate as was {{the appearance of the}} dull, misty daybreak, it was yet the most welcome of all the objects surrounding the starving soldier on which he could fix his languid gaze. <b>To</b> <b>look</b> back <b>on</b> the city behind him was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back <b>on</b> the dreary charnel-house of famine and death; <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down <b>on</b> the waste ground without the walls was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down <b>on</b> the dead body of the comrade of his watch, who, maddened by the pangs of hunger which he had suffered during the night, had cast himself from the rampart to meet a welcome death on the earth beneath. Famished and despairing, the sentinel crouched on the fortifications which he had now neither strength to pace nor care to defend, yearning for the food that he had no hope to obtain, as he watched the grey daybreak from his solitary post.|$|R
25|$|As a result, she retreats {{into her}} own mind and her own thinking. Her {{thoughts}} begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe or even Christian. She still sees her sin, but begins <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> it differently than the villagers ever have. She begins {{to believe that a}} person's earthly sins don't necessarily condemn them. She even {{goes so far as to}} tell Dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin won't keep them from getting to heaven, however, the Puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns.|$|E
25|$|Duthie's {{arguments}} were never fully accepted at the time, as critics tended <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> {{the relationship between}} the two plays as an either-or situation; A Shrew is either a reported text or an early draft. In more recent scholarship, however, the possibility that a text could be both has been shown to be critically viable. For example, in his 2003 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 2 Henry VI, Roger Warren makes the same argument for The First Part of the Contention. Randall Martin reaches the same conclusion regarding The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI. This lends support to the theory that A Shrew could be both a reported text and an early draft.|$|E
25|$|As {{the strike}} entered its fourth week, the police cracked down even harder on the Wobblies. The Los Angeles {{headquarters}} of the KKK handed out a pamphlet to local citizens to get more supports and help the police force break up the strike. Members of the Ku Klux Klan, with or without their hoods regularly came to the San Pedro docks to be a force of intimidation. The latter began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> the dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used {{with the permission of}} the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders in seeking to maintain rights of free speech. They included such prominent Los Angeles and Pasadena figures as Upton Sinclair.|$|E

At the time of his execution, Waller had been on death row for 630 days, then the longest death row stay in the state's history. His funeral was held on July 5 and was attended by 2,500 people. Only one white person, WDL Secretary Morris Milgram, attended. Other whites had been asked not to come; a reporter wrote of the exclusion that [...] " [...] did not want 'Odell Waller's murderers' <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> his face in death".|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} {{started in}} May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, {{and he had}} spare time {{to write a novel}} and nine short stories. He commented, [...] "It's odd how soon one comes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary." [...] Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that Those Three French Girls (1930) was [...] "as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{objection}} to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French Enlightenment, for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: [...] "Are your senses so gross as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> these breasts [...] the respectable treasures of nature [...] as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Knight {{served as}} Brattleboro's town clerk from 1773 to 1774. [...] He was {{admitted}} to the bar by New York's courts at about the same time, though the details of his legal studies are not known, and accepted an appointment from New York's governor as a commissioner for administering oaths. [...] These pro-New York activities caused local people loyal to Vermont <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> Knight with disfavor, and after two individuals were killed in a dispute between New York officials and the Vermonters who opposed them (the 1775 Westminster massacre), Knight fled Vermont for fear of retribution. [...] He resided in Boston and then New York City, and returned to Brattleboro the following year.|$|E

She burnt all the letters of Philippe's lovers through the years lest they fall into [...] "the wrong hands", noting that the scent of the perfumed letters nauseated her. Louis XIV assured the new Duke of Orléans, formerly the Duke of Chartres, that the past was forgotten and that henceforth he was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> him as his father. The court was devastated and his old friend, Louis XIV's discarded mistress Madame de Montespan, was also greatly affected, the two having been very close.|$|E

2500|$|During the French Enlightenment, {{there was}} a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual {{enticement}} or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child.

[...] Nearly a century later, also in France, {{a man from the}} provinces who attended a Court ball at the Tuileries in Paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: [...] "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, {{the area}} along the [...] road through Bagshot Heath (now the A30) {{was known as}} a haunt of highwaymen, such as William Davies - also known as the Golden Farmer – and Claude Duval. The land {{remained}} largely undeveloped and uncultivated due to a sandy topsoil making it unsuitable for farming. In A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, written between 1724 and 1726, Daniel Defoe described the area as barren and sterile; [...] "a mark of the just resentment shew'd by Heaven upon the Englishmen's pride... horrid and frightful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on,</b> not only good for little, but good for nothing". A brick tower was built on top of The Knoll in the 1770s, by John Norris of Blackwater. It may have been used for communications but there is no firm evidence. The remains are now known as The Obelisk.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{pictures}} were in storage, Clark kept the National Gallery {{open to the public}} during the war, hosting a celebrated series of lunchtime and early evening concerts. They were the inspiration of the pianist Myra Hess, whose idea Clark greeted with delight, as a suitable way for the building to be [...] "used again for its true purposes, the enjoyment of beauty." [...] There was no advance booking, and audience members were free to eat their sandwiches and walk in or out during breaks in the performance. The concerts were an immediate and enormous success. The Musical Times commented, [...] "Countless Londoners and visitors to London, civilian and service alike, came <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> the concerts as a haven of sanity in a distraught world." [...] 1,698 concerts were given to an aggregate audience of more than 750,000 people. Clark instituted an additional public attraction of a monthly featured picture brought from storage and exhibited along with explanatory material. The institution of a [...] "picture of the month" [...] was retained after the war, and, at 2017, continues to the present day.|$|E

I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best". Messi has denied any rivalry, saying that it was [...] "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano". In response to claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: [...] "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't {{with a lot of other}} players", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing".|$|E
2500|$|The war in Samnium, {{immediately}} afterwards, {{was attended}} with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, {{had made their}} battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver [...] The Romans had already learned of these splendid accountrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>on,</b> not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and courage [...] The dictator, as decreed by the senate, celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armor. So the Romans made use of the splendid armor of their enemies to do honor to the gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name of Samnites.|$|E
