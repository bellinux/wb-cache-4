25|$|In early 1945, {{after the}} royal coup that toppled Ion Antonescu's pro-Nazi regime and placed Romania in the Allies camp, Flueraș and George Grigorovici founded the Socialist Democratic Party, which claimed {{legitimacy}} inside the socialist camp and denounced {{collaboration with the}} Communists. It was dissolved in September 1946. Flueraș remained opposed to the main Social Democratic Party (PSD), and accused the growing Soviet influence which had found its advocates inside the latter political group (the wing led by Lothar Rădăceanu and Ștefan Voitec).

Using PS symbolism and reuniting the country's reformist groups, this established its own faction in the Chamber of Deputies, and was represented to the 2½ International. On May 7, 1927, the various groups in the Federation merged to reestablish the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD), led by Constantin <b>Titel</b> Petrescu. The Socialist Party, unlike other groups, refused to join the Second International, and affiliated instead with the Paris Bureau (it was joined in this by a group on the PSD's left wing).|$|E
25|$|The Social Democratic Party (PSD), {{which had}} been drawn into close {{collaboration}} with the PCR as early as 1944 (as part of the Singular Workers' Front, Frontul Unic Muncitoresc), had also seen a steady growth in numbers; the PSD was by then dominated by the pro-PCR wing of Ştefan Voitec and Lothar Rădăceanu, who purged the staunchly Reformist group of Constantin <b>Titel</b> Petrescu's in March 1946 (leading the latter to establish his as a minor independent group). The Communist Ana Pauker noted with dissatisfaction that certain members of the PSD continued to remain hostile to her party (she cited the example of an unnamed intellectual and low-ranking member of the PSD who, during a BPD meeting, shouted a slogan {{in support of the}} PNŢ's Iuliu Maniu).|$|E

40|$|Generally, “industrial policy” can {{be defined}} as {{government}} interventions to promote industrial development beyond what would be realized by free market conditions. In the globalisation processes, physical-resource-based industries are declining, while high-tech industries and services are fastly increasing.

25|$|As one of {{the leaders}} in the {{parliamentary}} opposition to the Alexandru Averescu government, he {{was at the center of}} a scandal in July 1921: during a prolonged debate, he was addressed an insult by the People's Party politician Constantin Argetoianu; promptly, the National Liberal Party (PNL) leader Ion G. Duca expressed his sympathy, and helped weaken political support for Averescu (the cabinet was to fall in autumn of that year). Nevertheless, Madgearu's rejection of PNL policies and the Ion I. C. Brătianu government led him to join, in 1923, Liga Drepturilor Omului (the League for Human Rights), reuniting a diverse group of leftist activists such as Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Constantin Mille, Nicolae L.

25|$|In February 1948, the Communists ended a {{long process}} of infiltrating the Romanian Social Democratic Party (ensuring control through electoral alliances and the two-party Frontul Unic Muncitoresc—Singular Workers' Front, the PCR had profited from the {{departure}} of Constantin <b>Titel</b> Petrescu's group from the Social Democrats in March 1946). The Social Democrats merged with the PCR to form the Romanian Workers' Party (Partidul Muncitoresc Român, PMR) which remained the ruling party's official name until 24 July 1965 (when it returned to the designation as Romanian Communist Party). Nevertheless, Social Democrats were excluded from most party posts and were forced to support Communist policies {{on the basis of}} democratic centralism; it was also reported that only half of the PSD's 500,000 members joined the newly founded grouping. Capitalizing on these gains, the Communist government banned almost all other political parties after winning purely formal elections in 1948 (the Ploughmen's Front and the Hungarian People's Union dissolved themselves in 1953).|$|E
25|$|On , {{just days}} after the party was founded, typesetters at various presses in Bucharest, who had been protesting since November, rallied in front of the Sfântul Ionică {{building}} and marched on the Ministry of Industry headquarters on Calea Victoriei, asking for the eight-hour day, salary increases, the guarantee of civil liberties, and more say for the trade unions. The group quickly swelled in numbers, to about as many as 15,000 workers in a contemporary account. On orders of the Constantin Coandă cabinet, who feared Bolshevik agitation, troops were ultimately ordered to fire on the crowd and assail it with bayonets in as many as three successive waves. They also stormed into the Sfântul Ionică building and arrested several Socialist leaders, including the general secretary Moscovici and I. C. Frimu (Frimu later died in custody). Four PS members, including Alecu Constantinescu, were each sentenced to five years in prison, while all others arrested were acquitted. Eventually, in February 1919, most demands of the Socialist group were fulfilled after the Transylvanian Socialists Iosif Jumanca and Ioan Flueraş, urged by Constantin <b>Titel</b> Petrescu, came to Bucharest and discussed the matter with both King Ferdinand and the new Premier, Ion I.
