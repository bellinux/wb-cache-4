There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E

On the September 5 episode of Raw, Fox was involved in a backstage confrontation with Nia Jax, resulting in a match between the two on the September 12 episode of Raw, which would end in a no contest after Jax speared Fox through the ringside barricade. On September 25, a rematch took place at Clash of Champions, where Fox was defeated. After suffering a streak of losses, Fox scored a victory over Dana Brooke on the November 4 episode of Superstars. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Fox was announced as one of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the 5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Women's Elimination match at Survivor Series from her brand's team, before winning a six-woman tag team match along with her fellow team partners.

Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167. Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed with some of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

On the same night, an impromptu team of Benoit and Edge defeated Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista) for the World Tag Team Championship, making Benoit a double champion. Two weeks later on Raw, Benoit retained the World Heavyweight title in a scheduled match against Shawn Michaels, after interference by Triple H. On May 10, a match between Shelton Benjamin and Triple H, resulted in Michaels attacking Triple H. Michaels' actions {{resulted in a}} suspension from Eric Bischoff. Prior to Raw that night, Bischoff informed Triple H that he would face Benoit for the World title the following week on Raw. The following week, Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Also that night, a Battle Royal took place, in which the winner {{would go on to}} face Benoit at Bad Blood for the World title.

5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for {{an hour in the}} hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Participation {{in regular}} {{physical}} activity is important for individuals with a mobility disability to decrease risk of chronic disease, improve quality of life, and maintain and improve functional ability. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for programs that can facilitate the adoption and maintenance of {{regular physical activity}} for adults with a mobility disability. Purpose: To pilot test a physical activity centered education (PACE) program for individuals with a mobility disability. Methods: A case study approach was adopted and consisted of two participants with a mobility disability, one in the support and one in the awareness group. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completed the 8 -week (1 90 minute session/week) PACE program in person at the Health Promotion for People with Disabilities Lab. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awareness group was mailed the PACE materials and completed the program independently at home. Thus, the primary between group differences was the intensity and type of support provided for physical activity adoption. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> each group completed pre, and post assessments, with <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completing an additional follow-up assessment measuring: (1) amount of weekly physical activity (self-report), (2) self-efficacy to be active, and (3) barriers to physical activity. Finally, after the follow-up assessment, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group completed an interview to evaluate the program. ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis of quantitative data was calculated and was reported in frequencies and percentage change over time. Qualitative data was analyzed using a cross-case analysis to identify themes and conceptual patterns in the responses. RESULTS: Both participants reported a decrease <b>in</b> barriers faced. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group reported decreased physical activity and increased self-efficacy whereas, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awareness group reported increased physical activity and decreased self-efficacy. During the follow-up interview, five themes were identified including (1) PA knowledge, (2) PA participation, (3) PA expectations, (4) Program participation, and (5) Program feedback. CONCLUSION: The findings from this case study were mixed between amount of activity completed, barriers faced, and self-efficacy. However, these results are difficult to interpret due to a confounding health factor (spinal stenosis) faced by <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> support group that likely impacted all outcome measures. Through the program evaluation, suggested program adjustments included improving program applicability by including community specific information, incorporating personalized activity plans, and providing practical examples of adapted activities of daily living and exercises...|$|R

In the process of finding leads, Tommy meets Kent Paul (Danny Dyer), who leads Tommy to one of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the ambush. Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz (Luis Guzmán), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the ambush. With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in the ambush, Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and {{distance himself from the}} Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E

In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase {{and then leave}} the ring {{in order to gain}} official possession of the case. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G.

Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E
5|$|The bokuseki style {{developed}} from Song Dynasty calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with Eisai in 1191. Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries. Later bokuseki {{became part of}} the zen practice and served as meditation help. They were often mounted on hanging scrolls, and displayed in temples and tea rooms. The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Rikyū considered them crucial to the tea ceremony {{in the sense that they}} put <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the right frame-of-mind. Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods.
