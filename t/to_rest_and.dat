5|$|For a {{few weeks}} in 1972, he and his parents and sister lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Cecil Day-Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> recuperate. Cecil died there in May that year.|$|E
5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E
5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, {{which had been}} largely destroyed. Expecting another attack, reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up positions in the two villages.

5|$|After a busy week {{servicing}} Hubble, {{the crew}} of Atlantis had {{the majority of the}} day off, giving them time <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> prepare for landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

5|$|From 1669, Klis Fortress {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule. After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and Imotski. Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance. Subsequently, Klis was taken by the Austrians. The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by Axis powers during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Gwyn {{continued}} his military duties with service around the James River near City Point, Virginia. Feeling ill, {{he returned to}} Philadelphia on October 31, 1864. He was diagnosed with malaria fever and prescribed a seven-day break <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> recover. His leave was approved on November 4, and he was permitted to recover for a week, resuming duty of November 7, 1864. At his return, Gwyn, by Special Orders No. 301 {{was assigned to the}} First Division, First Brigade under Brigadier General Griffin by Major General Fred T. Locke. On November 19, 1864, he was transferred from the First Division to the Second Division, which was under the command of General Romeyn Ayres.|$|E

Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake for themselves, and she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> the train to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E

This terminal {{has been described as}} having become a significant retail destination in India. Wi-Fi service and access, offices for bureau de change (currency exchange) and tourism advice are common, although the availability of service varies across airports. Some international airports provide secure areas for stranded passengers <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> sleep. The more usual service is hotels that are available on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike stopped <b>to</b> <b>rest,</b> <b>and</b> Reed {{returned}} {{alone to}} the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.|$|E
5|$|The People's Army of Vietnam {{had been}} {{utilizing}} {{large sections of}} relatively unpopulated eastern Cambodia as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in South Vietnam <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> reorganize without being attacked. These base areas were also utilized by the Vietnamese communists to store weapons and other material that had been transported {{on a large scale}} into the region on the Sihanouk Trail. PAVN forces had begun moving through Cambodian territory as early as 1963. In 1966, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, ruler of Cambodia, convinced of eventual communist victory in Southeast Asia and fearful for the future of his rule, had concluded an agreement with the People's Republic of China which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on Cambodian soil {{and the use of the}} Cambodian port of Sihanoukville for resupply.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of a default mode network (DMN) of brain function {{is based on}} observations of task-independent decreases of brain activity during effort as participants are engaged in tasks in contrast <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> On the other hand, studies also showed that DMN regions activate rather than deactivate in response to task-related events. Thus, does DMN “deactivate” during effort as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting?</b> We hypothesized that, with high-frequency event-related signals removed, the task-residual activities of the DMN would decrease as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> We addressed this hypothesis with two approaches. First, we examined DMN activities during <b>resting,</b> task residuals, <b>and</b> task conditions in the stop signal task using independent component analysis (ICA). Second, we compared the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) signals of DMN in <b>resting,</b> task residuals, <b>and</b> task data. In the results of ICA of 76 subjects, the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) showed increased activation during task as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> task residuals, indicating DMN responses to task events. Precuneus but not the PCC showed decreased activity during task residual as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting.</b> The latter finding was mirrored by fALFF, which is decreased in the precuneus during task residuals, as compared <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> task. These results suggested that the low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent signals of the precuneus may represent a useful index of effort during cognitive performance...|$|R

40|$|Viper venom disintegrins {{contain the}} RGD/KGD motif. They inhibit {{platelet}} aggregation and cell adhesion, but show structural and functional heterogeneity. We investigated {{the interaction of}} four prototypic disintegrins with alpha IIb beta 3 expressed {{on the surface of}} <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> activated platelets. The binding affinity (Kd) of 125 I-albolabrin, 125 I-echistatin, 125 I-bitistatin and 125 I-eristostatin toward resting platelets was 294, 153, 48 and 18 nM respectively. The Kd value for albolabrin decreased 3 -fold and 6 -fold after ADP- or thrombin-induced activation. The Kd values for bitistatin and echistatin also decreased with ADP, but there was no further decrease with thrombin. In contrast, eristostatin bound with the same high affinity <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> activated platelets. The pattern of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -eristostatin <b>and</b> FITC-albolabrin binding <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> activated platelets was consistent with observations using radiolabelled material. Eristostatin showed faster and more irreversible binding to platelets, and greater potency compared with albolabrin in inducing conformational neo-epitopes in beta 3. The anti-alpha IIb beta 3 monoclonal antibody OP-G 2 that is RGD-dependent inhibited disintegrin binding to activated platelets more strongly than binding <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> platelets <b>and</b> it inhibited the binding to platelets of albolabrin more strongly than eristostatin. The specificity of disintegrin interaction with alpha IIb beta 3 was confirmed by demonstrating cross-linking of these peptides to alpha IIb beta 3 on normal platelets, but not to thrombasthenic platelets deficient in alpha IIb beta 3...|$|R

5|$|During that operation, American {{soldiers}} initially {{made only}} limited {{contact with the}} Viet Cong, but defeated enemy troops in two separate battles. On June 17 the 1/16th infantry battalion, re-enforced by a company of 2/28th infantry engaged in a six-hour battle supported by airstrikes and massive artillery. The majority of the casualties suffered from that engagement alone, when the operation concluded on June 26, the 1st Infantry Division had lost 57 soldiers dead and 197 wounded. Then in September, following a string of attacks on allied military installations by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops, Major General John H. Hay decided to temporarily stop conducting large-scale operations until the true intentions of Communist forces were known. Towards October, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment marched into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> refit for their next major operation. To disrupt the Viet Cong's resting period, General Hay launched Operation Shenandoah II to clear a section of National Highway 13 which stretched from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
