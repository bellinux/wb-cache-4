2500|$|When {{supplying}} {{a branch}} circuit {{with more than}} one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a [...] "common trip" [...] breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common <b>trip</b> <b>breakers</b> are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common <b>trip</b> <b>breakers</b> are typically used to supply three-phase electric power to large motors or further distribution boards.|$|R
40|$|Protection {{of power}} system {{elements}} such as transmission lines, generators, etc., often requires accurate measurement of three-phase voltage to provide reliable fault detection and breaker operations to minimize power system disruptions. Incorrectly measuring {{one or more of}} the three-phase voltages by a protective relay may result in erroneous <b>trips</b> (<b>breaker</b> operations) and/or clearing more of the power system than desired. A common failur...|$|R
5000|$|At 8:02 am, {{three of}} the Richmond {{converter}} modules <b>breakers</b> <b>tripped.</b> A fourth tripped shortly afterward. After the fourth Richmond <b>breaker</b> <b>tripped,</b> the system began to destabilize. Human operators recognized the impending system damage and manually tripped the remaining power supplies, shutting down the entire 25 Hz network.|$|R
40|$|Circuit breaker with no {{moving parts}} protects direct-current (dc) loads. Current which circuit <b>breaker</b> opens (<b>trip</b> current) is {{adjustable}} {{and so is}} time delay before <b>breaker</b> <b>trips.</b> Forward voltage drop rises from 0. 6 to 1. 2 V as current rises to <b>trip</b> point. <b>Breaker</b> has two terminals, like fuse, therefore replaces fuse in dc circuit. Powered by circuit it protects and reset by either turning off power source or disconnecting load...|$|R
25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a <b>tripped</b> <b>breaker,</b> while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|R
50|$|Quick trip has {{big impact}} on system design. Enough short circuit current will {{available}} for <b>tripping</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> with a minimum number of units {{without the need for}} an extra parallel Static Transfer Switch.|$|R
30|$|After {{the fault}} {{elements}} are determined, the action status of breaker connected to fault element {{also need to}} be monitored. Only when a breaker refuse to work, can the wide area backup protection (far backup) <b>trip</b> the remote <b>breakers</b> that is associated with the faulty breaker., The wide area backup protection should cooperate with the other protection and the <b>breakers,</b> and <b>trip</b> the minimum <b>breakers</b> to isolate the fault.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, all of Quebec {{and parts}} of New England and New Brunswick lost power because of an {{equipment}} failure at a substation on the North Shore. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm <b>tripped</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> on the transmission network causing a nine-hour Quebec-wide blackout.|$|R
25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common <b>trip</b> <b>breakers</b> must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|R
25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must <b>trip</b> the <b>breaker</b> to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and <b>trip</b> the <b>breaker.</b> Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{variations}} in the earth's magnetic field also <b>tripped</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> on Hydro-Qu√©bec's power grid. The utility's very long transmission lines {{and the fact that}} most of Quebec sits on a large rock shield prevented current flowing through the earth, finding a less resistant path along the 735 kV power lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a crowbar over a clamp is that the low holding voltage of the crowbar lets it carry higher fault current without dissipating much power (which could otherwise cause overheating). Also, a crowbar is more likely than a clamp to deactivate a device (by blowing a fuse or <b>tripping</b> a <b>breaker),</b> bringing attention to the faulty equipment.|$|R
25|$|Low-resistance {{grounding}} systems use {{a neutral}} grounding resistor (NGR) {{to limit the}} fault current to 25A or greater. Low resistance grounding systems will have a time rating (say, 10 seconds) that indicates how long the resistor can carry the fault current before overheating. A ground fault protection relay must <b>trip</b> the <b>breaker</b> to protect the circuit before overheating of the resistor occurs.|$|R
30|$|The {{external}} <b>trip</b> of adjacent <b>breakers</b> {{is through}} {{any of the}} breaker controllers (SCUi) represented by IEDs 5 and 6 in the figure. They are required to clear the fault.|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{effects of}} lightning, {{the damage to}} or {{malfunction}} of electrical equipment that results from lightning flashes, were considered. These effects range from <b>tripped</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> to computer upset, to physical damage to input or output circuits of electronic equipment. Voltages and currents induced by lightning on the electrical wiring of the aircraft were emphasized {{regardless of whether or}} not such voltages and currents cause damage or upset of electrical equipment...|$|R
50|$|Two {{identical}} {{current transformers}} {{are used for}} each winding of a transformer, stator, or other device. The current transformers are placed around opposite ends of a winding. The current through both ends should be identical. A protective relay detects any imbalance in currents, and <b>trips</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> to isolate the device. In {{the case of a}} transformer, the circuit breakers on both the primary and secondary would open.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1955, the Square D [...] "QO" [...] line of {{miniature}} 3/4-inch circuit breakers may be their best-known product line, {{used in the}} electrical distribution boards of many residences in North America. The [...] "QO" [...] designation stands for [...] "Qwik-Open"; Square D claims these are the fastest-opening breakers in the industry, responding within 1/60th of a second, or just one full power cycle on a 60 Hz AC line. QO breakers feature a window with a visual trip indication flag, {{making it easy to}} identify a <b>tripped</b> <b>breaker</b> in a panel. A [...] "QOB" [...] version is also offered, which stands for [...] "Qwik-Open Bolted", featuring a screw that secures the beaker in the panel. This is useful in industrial installations where vibration might cause a QO snap-in breaker to loosen and prevents them from accidentally being popped out while an adjacent breaker is being changed. A QO breaker could easily be clipped into a QOB panel. The QO and QOB series breakers are by far their most popular commercial products.|$|R
5000|$|This {{particular}} DC-9 {{had experienced}} {{a number of problems}} over {{the months leading up to}} the incident; 76 maintenance reports had been filed in the plane's logs in the previous year, and the CVR records Cameron telling Ouimet to [...] "put <b>tripping</b> <b>breakers</b> in the book there" [...] when the breakers fail to respond to the first reset attempt at 18:52. Nearly four years earlier, on 17 September 1979, the plane, then serving as Air Canada Flight 680 (Boston, Massachusetts to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia), had suffered an explosive decompression in the rear bulkhead that required rebuilding the tail section and replacing or splicing most of the wiring and hydraulic lines in the back of the plane; Cameron later noted that the Air Canada maintenance crew [...] "did a heck of a job getting everything put back together" [...] after the decompression incident. Investigators were unable to find signs of arcing in any of the wire splices from the repairs done four years earlier, though much of the wiring in the rear of the plane was severely damaged or destroyed by the fire itself.|$|R
50|$|Fiber-optic sensors {{are used}} in {{electrical}} switchgear to transmit light from an electrical arc flash to a digital protective relay to enable fast <b>tripping</b> of a <b>breaker</b> to reduce the energy in the arc blast.|$|R
25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that <b>trips</b> the circuit <b>breaker</b> sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element <b>trips</b> the circuit <b>breaker</b> with no intentional additional delay.|$|R
25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, on March 13, 1989 at 2:44 am, a large {{geomagnetic}} storm caused variations in the earth's magnetic field, <b>tripping</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> on the transmission network. The James Bay network went off line in less than 90 seconds, giving Quebec its second blackout in 11 months. The power failure lasted 9 hours, and forced Hydro-Qu√©bec to implement a program to reduce {{the risks associated with}} geomagnetically induced currents.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} wiring {{protection}} are standard thermal breakers and arc fault circuit breakers. Thermal breakers require an overload condition {{long enough that}} a heating element in the <b>breaker</b> <b>trips</b> the <b>breaker</b> off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs {{in a very small}} area. A problem with arc fault circuit breaker is {{they are more likely to}} produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.|$|R
5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is {{high enough to}} <b>trip</b> the circuit <b>breaker</b> then disruption of service will occur. Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (bushings) can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.|$|R
30|$|In {{cases like}} {{maintenance}} testing or commissioning of new bay {{protection and control}} schemes in an energized substation, the test equipment should send messages with the simulation bit or test bit set to TRUE, {{in order to prevent}} undesired <b>tripping</b> of circuit <b>breakers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{theory and}} {{application}} of these protective devices {{is an important part}} of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power system protection. The need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and <b>trip</b> a <b>breaker</b> within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules. A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|R
50|$|IEDs {{receive data}} from sensors and power equipment, and can issue control commands, such as <b>tripping</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> if they sense voltage, current, or {{frequency}} anomalies, or raise/lower voltage levels {{in order to}} maintain the desired level. Common types of IEDs include protective relaying devices, On Load Tap Changer controllers, circuit breaker controllers, capacitor bank switches, recloser controllers, voltage regulators etc. This is generally controlled by a setting file. The testing of setting files is typically one of the most time consuming roles of a protection tester.|$|R

50|$|Arcing {{can also}} occur when a low {{resistance}} channel (foreign object, conductive dust, moisture...) forms between places with different voltage. The conductive channel then can facilitate {{formation of an}} electric arc. The ionized air has high electrical conductivity approaching that of metals, and it can conduct extremely high currents, causing a short circuit and tripping protective devices (fuses and circuit breakers). A similar situation may occur when a lightbulb burns out and the fragments of the filament pull an electric arc between the leads inside the bulb, leading to overcurrent that <b>trips</b> the <b>breakers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pantograph-equipped {{locomotives}} {{must not}} {{run through a}} section break when one side is de-energized. The locomotive would become trapped, but as it passes the section break the pantograph will briefly short the two catenary lines together. If the opposite line is de-energized, this voltage transient may <b>trip</b> supply <b>breakers.</b> If the line is under maintenance, injury may occur as the catenary is suddenly energized. Even if the catenary is properly grounded, the arc generated across the pantograph will likely cause damage to the pantograph, the catenary insulator, or both.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of power {{electronics}} has caused a greater awareness of power quality. Voltage sags, swells, harmonics can cause equipment to fail, mis-operate or shut down, as well as create huge current imbalances which could blow fuses or <b>trip</b> <b>breakers.</b> These effects can be very expensive for the customer, ranging from minor quality variations to production downtime and equipment damage. The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is fast, flexible and efficient solution to voltage sag/swell problem. In this work Z-Source Inverter (ZSI) based DVR will be proposed. The ZSI uses an LC impedance grid to couple power source to inverter circuit and prepares the possibility of voltage buck and boost by short circuiting the inverter legs. ZSI based DVR is controlled by PI controller. PI control scheme suffers from fixed gains, i. e., it cannot adapt itself to the varying parameter and conditions of system. To overcome this drawback this work proposes a fuzzy controller. This is a non linear controller and it can provide a better performance under changing system parameters and operating conditions based on knowledge base and rule base. This work proposes another control method of Hybrid fuzzy-PI which is combination of PI and fuzzy controllers. The control schemes of ZSI based DVR are modelled and simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK under voltage sags and swells...|$|R
2500|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a protective}} relay is a relay device designed to <b>trip</b> a circuit <b>breaker</b> when a fault is detected. The first protective relays were electromagnetic devices, relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating {{conditions such as}} over-current, over-voltage, reverse power flow, over-frequency, and under-frequency.|$|R
25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially <b>tripping</b> electrical <b>breakers</b> or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.|$|R
50|$|Physically, in a {{three phase}} winding a {{positive}} sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field {{with the opposite}} rotation, and the zero sequence set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool {{became the basis for}} the design of protective relays, which used negative-sequence voltages and currents as a reliable indicator of fault conditions. Such relays may be used to <b>trip</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> or take other steps to protect electrical systems.|$|R
