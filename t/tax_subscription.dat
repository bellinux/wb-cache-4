50|$|Around the globe, {{broadcast}} TV is {{financed by}} government, advertising, licensing (a form of <b>tax),</b> <b>subscription,</b> or {{any combination of}} these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2 million TV households {{with at least one}} TV and total revenues of 268.9 billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008). North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%). Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%-50% TV advertising revenues, 40%-45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.|$|E
50|$|Public land {{transport}} refers to carriage {{of people and}} goods by government or commercial entities which is {{made available to the}} public at large for the purpose of facilitating the economy and society they serve. Most transport infrastructure and large transport vehicles are operated in this manner. Funds to pay for such transport may come from <b>taxes,</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> direct user fees, or some combination. The vast majority of public transport is land-based, with commuting and postal delivery being the primary purposes.|$|R

60|$|In {{order to}} raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is clearly {{necessary}} to give every possible support to the public credit. To that end a uniform currency, in which <b>taxes,</b> <b>subscriptions</b> to loans, and all other ordinary public dues {{as well as all}} private dues may be paid, is almost if not quite indispensable. Such a currency can be furnished by banking associations organized under a general act of Congress, as suggested in my message {{at the beginning of the}} present session. The securing of this circulation by the pledge of United States bonds, as therein suggested, would still further facilitate loans, by increasing the present and causing a future demand for such bonds.|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, {{as early}} as 1805, {{according}} to Beers 1881 History, a schoolhouse was erected on the farm of Captain McPherson, located on Section 21, near the present site of Tecumseh High School. Another was located on the farm of George Lowman of New Carlisle, located near the juncture of present-day Addison-Carlisle Road and Route 235. Both were known as landmarks and used as points of reference by the early settlers.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} impact on fiscal {{revenues}} of taxing a two-sided monopolistic platform offering personalized services to users and targeted advertising to sellers, based on the collection of users' personal data. We show that {{the introduction of a}} small tax on data collection, which has been proposed in the French context by Collin and Colin, fails to increase fiscal revenues if the value-added tax (VAT) rate is high enough, due to a tax base interdependence effect between the two taxes. Under a supermodularity condition on the platform's profit function as a function of its prices, this result generalizes to any per-unit tax. However, in some cases, an ad valorem <b>tax</b> on <b>subscriptions</b> or on advertising may raise fiscal revenues, irrespective of the VAT rate, as well as welfare...|$|R
2500|$|Censorship of {{newspapers}} and magazines was even stricter. in 1800 Napoleon closed down sixty political newspapers, leaving just thirteen. In February 1811 he decided that this was still too many, and reduced the number to just eight newspapers, almost supporting him. One relatively independent paper, the Journal de l'Empire continued to exist, and by 1812 {{was the most popular}} newspaper, with 32,000 subscriptions. Newspapers were also heavily <b>taxed,</b> and <b>subscriptions</b> were expensive; an annual subscription cost about 56 francs in 1814. Because of the high cost {{of newspapers}}, many Parisians went to cabinets litteraires or reading salons, which numbered about one hundred and fifty. For a subscription of about six francs a month, readers could find a selection of newspapers, plus billiards, cards or chess games. Some salons displayed caricatures of the leading figures of the day.|$|R

A perhaps unintended consequence of the ClassPass business model is that in Washington, DC, users do not have to pay sales <b>tax</b> for the <b>subscription</b> as they would have to if they were paying directly for classes or memberships at the individual workout studios.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} an issue {{hitherto}} unexplored in the literature, namely, the 'new shares' price setting during the subscription period. We report evidence of a spread between the old stock price {{and the value of}} new shares obtained through subscription. A framework is developed within which to analyse the explanatory factors involved in this spread in the Spanish Stock Exchange. The empirical evidence suggests that new share prices during the subscription period are influenced by a range of factors, such as difference in the amount of <b>tax</b> to which <b>subscription</b> rights and capital gains are subject, characteristics of the issuer and the issue, norms established between clients and banks and the microstructure of the subscription rights market. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{commodity}} taxation when firms use two-part tariffs {{in model}} of competition A la Hotelling. Three kinds of taxes are considered: a specific tax, an ad valorem {{one on the}} subscription fee and an ad valorem one on the per usage fee. We first derive the equilibrium tariffs, market shares and profits. We show that the <b>tax</b> on the <b>subscription</b> fee is profit neutral (unlike the other two) but socially costly (like the other two) as it modifies the consumption choice of the consumers. In a context of costly public funds the ad valorem taxation on the variable fee dominates specific taxation. Moreover, the ranking between ad valorem taxation on the fixed fee and an ad valorem taxation on the variable fee depends on the relative magnitude of economic parameters, in particular the degree of differentation. Finally, we show that the government might prefer the use of two-part tariffs rather than the use of more general tariffs. two-parts tariffs, commodity taxation...|$|R
