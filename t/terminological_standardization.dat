50|$|Since {{the early}} 1930s in Wieselburg, Austria, {{industrialist}} Eugen Wüster led a private centre studying terminology {{as part of}} his engineering firm. His research on international technical communication resulted in the 1936 founding of the Technical Committee for Terminology Standardization of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/TC 37). During the 1950s and 1960s Wüster formulated a general theory of terminology and was a pioneer of <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization.</b> In 1951 the Austrian Standards Institute (ASI) made Wüster general secretary responsible for its terminology principles and coordination efforts (the ISO/TC 37 technical committee).|$|E

40|$|Controlled {{languages}} are specially defined subsets of natural language which help to create clear and concise documents, and thus insure coherent communication. In this paper we approach controlled language through {{the definitions of}} specialized terms {{with a view to}} establishing a metalanguage for the basic format of definitions. Our research focuses on a corpus of specialized terms related to tides, extracted from the Glossary of Coastal Terminology elaborated by the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The methodology used for elaborating controlled-language definitions is based on the Functional-Lexematic Model (FLM) (Martín Mingorance 1984, 1989, 1995; Faber and Mairal 1999). The conceptual structure of a domain is made explicit within definitions that are coherent in both their micro and macrostructure (Faber and Terced or Sánchez 2001). The linguistic description of any specialized concepts should do the following: (1) make category membership explicit; (2) reflect its relations with other concepts within the same category; (3) specify its essential attributes and features (Faber et al., 2005). Our results show that the use of controlled language in the definition of terms makes their conceptual description more coherent and systematic. Controlled language increases <b>terminological</b> consistency, facilitates <b>standardization,</b> simplifies syntax, and avoids semantic ambiguities...|$|R

As a matter of fact, the adoption of formal ontologies is almost becoming standard in medical informatics, since it provides many advantages, including <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> and the definition of a common semantics. For instance, SNOMED ([URL] is a widely used clinical terminology, and stresses that “the use of a standard clinical terminology makes a significant contribution towards improving the quality and safety of healthcare by enabling consistent representation of meaning in an electronic health record”.

The present paper exemplifies the opposition on the basis of texts that have been translated in both periods (viz.

In Serbian, the terms such as vigor, viability and germ inability are used in various ways, depending on the author, which leaves room to possible misunderstanding in interpretation of research results and misuse of expert terminology. The modest lexical fund, compared to that of the English language, for instance, greatly contributes to the problem, and so does the absence of <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization.</b> Since the current technology and research level in seed science and technology requires appropriate terminology, this article offers an outline of basic seed traits related expert terminology as a foundation of future seed research and technology development. ...|$|E
40|$|We are {{currently}} witnessing {{a trend toward}} an architectural separation of a knowledge base (KB) into an ontology {{and a set of}} rules. The ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships from the application domain; the rules are problem solving procedures expressed with the terms from the ontology. Moreover, <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> taking place in more and more domains has {{led to the development of}} domain ontologies. These two developments raise the prospect of reusing existing ontologies when building a new knowledge based system. For instance, the Disciple approach for building a knowledge based agent relies on importing ontologies from existing repositories of knowledge, and on teaching the agent how to perform various tasks, in a way that resembles how an expert would teach a human apprentic...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{dominant}} design {{has taken on a}} quasi-paradigmatic status in analyses of the link between technological and industrial dynamics. A review of the empirical literature reveals a variety of interpretations about some aspects of the phenomenon such as its underlying causal mechanisms and its level of analysis. To stimulate further progress in empirical research on dominant designs, we advocate a standardization of terminology by conceptualizing products as complex artifacts that evolve {{in the form of a}} nested hierarchy of technology cycles. Such a nested complex system perspective provides both unambiguous definitions of dominant designs (stable core components that can be stable interfaces) and inclusion of multiple levels of analysis (system, subsystems, components). We introduce the {{concept of a}}n operational principle and offer a systematic definition of core and peripheral subsystems based on the concept of pleiotropy. We also discuss how the proposed <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> can stimulate cumulative research on dominant designs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The correct {{manipulation}} of semantic information {{is essential for}} {{the development and implementation of}} medical guideline server. This is a knowledge based information system for computeraided processing of clinical practice guidelines. In this study the following core functions are involved in the data processing of guideline server: (1) information transfer from other hospital information systems, (2) knowledge processing and (3) reporting functions. An execution engine is developed for guideline knowledge processing by our group. The ontological structures of the knowledge are the results of a knowledge engineering process. Additionally, the <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is integrated into the execution engine. The applied methodical approach for the ontology development is explained as a part of the knowledge engineering process. The developed ontological structures are used as interface descriptions for data and information transfer from electronic health record (e. g. test for plausibility) as well as for report generation and documentation (i. e. generation and explanation of terms and term sequences). The developed concepts are presented in this paper.

40|$|By the late-nineteenth {{century the}} brick {{industry}} was largely mechanized. In {{accordance with the}} changing technologies' capacity to produce greater numbers of increasingly uniform products (in shape, color and durability), the notion of—and market for—"face brick" changed drastically during this time. It was because of this newfound uniformity that face brick ultimately became fully differentiated from the lower-quality "common brick" product. Over the next decades, architects and builders became increasingly interested {{in the use of}} textured and multi-colored face brick for the exterior of buildings. This was a strict departure from the earlier years of largely smooth-surfaced brick production. The production of face brick was truly a national industry by the 19 -teens, and it was reported that in 1915 face brick was produced in forty-two states across the United States. The widespread location of good brickmaking clays, rail transportation, and product marketing all contributed {{to the success of the}} face brick industry. Research on this topic revolves around color, texture and size of early twentieth century face brick and explores the ways in which product trends evolved throughout the decades before and after the turn of the new century. Research has also been undertaken on the role and development of technology in production—how raw materials, equipment and methods changed to reflect evolving aesthetic trends. Production methods (soft-mud, stiff-mud, dry-press, re-press) have been investigated, as has the role of face brick manufacturers in the evolution of brick size standardization within the larger building brick industry. The rapid evolution of face brick production processes, terminology, and aesthetics over the course of approximately sixty years (1880 - 1940) created an ever-growing national face brick industry that was cemented by the 1912 establishment of the American Face Brick Association. The development of this association has been traced, revealing its early role in the aesthetic and <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> of products, as well as its publication of a large number of catalogs which no doubt led to the widespread use of face brick on buildings large and small, in a multitude of urban and suburban environments across the country. In the late 1930 s, the American Face Brick Association merged with several other clay products associations to form the Structural Clay Products Institute, the predecessor of today's Brick Industry Association. This research has revealed a strong connection to not only today's preservation professionals, but to clay brick industry members such as manufacturers and distributors. Due to the historical nature of the brick trade and the lack of organized documentation of early twentieth century face brick, however, it is often difficult to visually identify, research, and subsequently reproduce a deteriorated face brick product. Knowledge of historic production methods and products is therefore essential for both preservation consultants and trade-oriented participants of a face brick restoration project, particularly as increasing numbers of face brick preservation projects are likely in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|Die wichtigste Frage der Forschungsarbeit besteht darin, inwiefern man die Anwendung der ISO/TC 37 internationalen terminologischen Normen auf Akpekte des Exportbereiches verbessern kann wie: technische Normung, Management des Wissens, der Information und der Kommunikation, estrategische Planung, Anwendung des terminologischen Managements in der Industrie und den Handel und der Nutzen der ICT für ein Land wie Kolumbien. Aus dieser grossen Frage kommen die Elemente der Forschung, die gleichzeitig die Quellenanlage sind. Zuerst werden die Normen vom technischen Komitee ISO/TC 37 gennant, von denen nur einige ausgewählt wurden, die wichtig wegen ihrer Inhalte und Anwendbarkeit sind. Diese Normen sind: ISO 704 Grundsätze und Methoden, ISO 860 Harmonisierung von Begriffen und Termini, ISO 15188 Terminologische Projekte, ISO 29383 Terminologische Politik. Da das ausgewählte Szenarium für diese Forschungsarbeit der kolumbianische Exportbereich ist, wurden einige Institutionen und Programme wegen ihrer wichigen Rolle ausgewählt. Diese Institutionen und Programme unterstutzen die mittleren und kleinen Unternehmen, damit sie ihre Produkte auf den internationalen Märkten besser präsentieren und verkaufen können. Diese lauten: ICONTEC, als das offizielle Normungsinstitut in Kolumbien; PROEXPORT, als die offizielle Institution für die Unterstützung der mittleren und kleinen Unternehmen, die das Potenziall haben zu exportieren und NOREXPORT, als das Programm, das die Normen der Andenlaender harmonisiert, damit der internationalen Handel zwischen diesen Ländern leichter und grösser wird. Um die Anwendung veranschaulich zu machen, wird die Methode der Fallstudie benutzt. Dadurch werden die Anwendungen der ausgewählten terminologischen Normen auf den jeweiligen Institutionen und Programmen uebertragen. Zum Schluss, wird einen Vorschlag preäsentiert, der aufzeigt, wie man einen ganzen Wissensmanagementprozess durchfuehren kann, der auf Terminologie basiert ist und der die terminologischen Normen beruecksichtigt. Dieser Prozess wird in einer terminologischen Datenbank realisiert, die als Werkzeug für die Fachkommunikation im Exportbereich in Kolumbien dienen kann. {{research}} paper aims {{to prove the}} application of the International Terminology Standards and constitutes a contribution to the dissemination of the principles and methods proposed by the technical committee ISO/TC 37. To do so, a particular area of the Colombian economy has been chosen in order to prove the influence of the International Standards to improve a given subject field and especially within the field of international trade. On one hand, a set of standards have been taken from the technical committee ISO/TC 37, which are representative of the terminological work and which show their implementation within the given context. On the other hand, some institutions and programs from the Colombian export system have been chosen as well due, over all, to their role as promoters and supporters of Colombian export entrepreneurs. At the same time, the development of terminology as a science in Colombia is also a very important research element viewed from the perspective of its relationship with the industrial sector being even more focused on its relationship with the export sector. Since International Terminology Standards are based on well-known theoretical and methodological pillars, this {{research paper}} gives a brief review of the development in time of technical languages and how they became object of a different theory called “General terminology theory” proposed by Eugen Wüster in his “Einführung in die Allgemeine Terminologielehre und Terminologische Lexikographie” (1979). Three of the most important contributions highlighted in this research paper, done by this terminology theory include its interdisciplinary aspect, where other sciences find their place such as cognitive science, knowledge science, information science, communication science, logic, among others. The second crucial component of the terminology theory is the standardization aspect which complements work towards the establishment of a set of terminological principles and methods used in a general way beyond individual languages or a subject field. Regarding the <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> as a fundamental item of the terminology, there is also a short outline about the history and evolution of the international terminology standardization pointing out its essence as supporting activity to facilitate and accelerate international trade. And the third element is the terminology science dimension as knowledge management system, which has developed a whole theory based on information, communication and knowledge organization model named WIKO (Budin 1996). This model places the terminology system as a transversal system crossing the information, communication and knowledge systems. From this perspective, the terminology system is able to affect the other systems because it works at the level of concepts taken as knowledge units which are present to a certain degree in all the other systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa trata do vocabulário técnico têxtil, especialmente na área do vestuário, utilizado como instrumento didático no processo ensino-aprendizagem do curso de Engenharia Têxtil, da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte. Esse vocabulário foi criteriosamente examinado com o propósito de ser conceituado e contextualizado, nas subáreas do vestuário, materiais (tecidos e aviamentos) e produtos (peças do vestuário), e, para isso, propomos um dicionário terminológico, justificado e avaliado por professores e alunos. Assim, a pesquisa comporta três etapas principais: (a) caracterização da percepção do vocabulário técnico da área do vestuário, e identificação de uma demanda pedagógica formulada por professores e alunos da área têxtil: a necessidade de um dicionário técnico do vestuário; (b) proposta de uma metodologia, e elaboração de um produto concreto, para suprir essa demanda: um dicionário de terminologia do vestuário; (c) avaliação desse produto por professores e alunos da área. Aplicamos a abordagem qualitativa, fundamentada nos princípios Terminologia e a na técnica de Grupo Focal. Para a primeira etapa, utilizamos a técnica dos grupos focais. Na segunda etapa, utilizamos a metodologia terminológica, adaptada à nossa realidade de ensino. E na execução da terceira etapa, recorremos, também, à técnica dos grupos focais. Constatamos que a {{principal}} preocupação de professores e alunos converge para a falta de padronização do vocabulário, que dificulta a comunicação, tanto no processo ensino-aprendizagem quanto nas atividades profissionais. As causas da falta de padronização são variadas e se sobrepõem, mas foram apontadas entre as principais: os regionalismos, o uso de analogias, os estrangeirismos e a baixa escolaridade. Quanto à necessidade de um dicionário de terminologia do vestuário, ficou evidenciada a falta de material bibliográfico em português do Brasil. Tanto professores como alunos mencionaram, repetidamente, a escassez de material técnico. Nesse sentido, um dicionário técnico, adaptado à nossa realidade, pode representar uma contribuição substancial para a normalização terminológica. Para atender a essa demanda, elaboramos um dicionário de terminologia do vestuário, com 760 entradas, construído conforme os procedimentos da moderna terminologia com os necessários ajustes. A avaliação do dicionário foi bastante positiva no que se refere à sua estrutura, conteúdo e usos possíveis em diversos contextos. Os participantes salientaram sua contribuição para a padronização do vocabulário que, conforme observado se configurava num dos principais problemas. Professores e alunos destacaram sua utilidade para o ensino-aprendizagem, como obra de referência, fonte de informações técnicas e instrumento de estudo e planejamento didático. Acreditamos que, através da criação do dicionário de terminologia do vestuário, estamos colaborando de maneira significativa para as práticas pedagógicas no curso de Engenharia Têxtil. Há ainda, a expectativa de que esse instrumento possa ser útil às demais áreas têxtil. Com este trabalho, não pretendemos exaurir a pesquisa. Temos consciência de suas limitações, em contraposição à amplitude e complexidade que exigiria um trabalho terminológico que incluísse todas as áreas e subáreas do curso de Engenharia Têxtil. No entanto, temos a convicção de que ele poderá servir como uma importante fonte para disseminação de conceitos sobre a área do vestuário, e, acreditamos, colaborar para a efetivação da padronização da terminologia utilizada nessa áreaThis research work {{deals with the}} compilation of a dictionary on clothing terminology intended {{to be used as}} a pedagogic tool as part of the teaching and learning process in the Textile Engineering Course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The main terms were selected and assessed by a team of textile teachers and students with the objective to be structured as a conceptual body of information on the following sub-areas of clothing terminology: materials (fabrics and trimmings) and products (garments). This research comprises three main steps: (a) characterization and understanding of the technical vocabulary in the clothing area as well as the identification of a pedagogic demand for a dictionary on clothing terminology, clearly expressed by the textile lecturers and students involved in the assessment of the need and validation of this project development; (b) a proposal for a specific methodology for the compilation of the dictionary which could help the communication process in the lecturing of clothing terminology and (c) based on the terminological principles and the technique of focal groups the dictionary was assessed. The technique of focal groups was used in the first step. In the second step the technique used was that of the terminological methodology adapted to the teaching approach in the Textile Course. In the third step the technique of focal groups was again utilized. It was observed that the main concern of lecturers and students is the lack of a standardized vocabulary, which renders difficult the communication process in both the teaching and learning activities as well as the professional ones in the textile industries. Various aspects, which can overlap, cause this lack of standardization. The main ones pointed out by the study team in the focal groups are: usage of regional words or expressions, usage of foreign words or expressions, analogies, and the low level of formal education, mainly among the industry workers. Another aspect to be considered is the lack of textile literature written in the Portuguese language of Brazil. This evidence shows the importance of a clothing terminology dictionary which will benefit both the education and professional activties in this field of knowledge. This dictionary will also give a substantial contribution to <b>terminological</b> <b>standardization</b> in our research field. With view to fulfill this demand, a dictionary of clothing terminology was compiled with 760 main entries, according to the modern practice in terminology with the necessary modifications concerning our needs. The result of the dictionary assessment was very assertive regarding its structure, contents and possible use in various contexts. The team work emphasized their contribution to the standardization process of the terms that proved to be one of the most important and difficult aspects of this researh work. The significance of this structured terminological dictionary was confirmed by the focal group participants relating to its use for teaching and learning activities, as a reference book, as a source of technical information and also as a tool for pedagogic studies and planning, as well as a significant collaboration to the pedagogic practices in the textile engineering course at University or any other educational institution. Besides, this dictionary can also be used to supply information within the textile field. We are aware that the present work will not exhaust the objectives of this research due to its limitations in opposition to the vast complexity demanded by the compilation of a complete work including all the areas and sub-areas of textile engineering. However, it is an important source for dissemination of concepts on the field of clothing terminology and a tool to effective standardization of the terms used in this subject fiel...|$|E
