40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the proportion {{and number of}} cancers occurring in Australia in 2010 attributable to parous women having breastfed for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> ≤ 12 months. Methods: We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of breast cancers (the only cancer site with convincing evidence of causal association) associated with women breastfeeding for ≤ 12 months in total, using standard formulae incorporating breastfeeding prevalence data, relative risks associated with breastfeeding and cancer incidence. We also estimated the proportion change in disease incidence (potential impact fraction [PIF]) that might have occurred under two hypothetical scenarios of women breastfeeding for longer durations. Results: An estimated 235 (1. 7 %) breast cancer cases that occurred in Australian in 2010 {{could be attributed to}} women breastfeeding for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> ≤ 12 months. Assuming a hypothetical increase in breastfeeding, we estimated that the number of breast cancers prevented would range from 36 to 51 (prevented fraction = 0. 3 % to 0. 4 %). Conclusions: More than 200 breast cancers were attributable to women breastfeeding for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> ≤ 12 months. Implications: Policies to increase breastfeeding duration may help prevent breast cancers in the future...|$|R

5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the final}} year in a consecutive string of three very active seasons, {{although many of the}} storms were weak. It is tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2011 for having the third-most named storms on record. It was also the third-costliest season, behind 2005 and 2017. The season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. However, Alberto, the first system of the year, developed on May19 – the earliest date of formation since Tropical Storm Ana in 2003. A second tropical cyclone, Beryl, developed later that month. This was the first occurrence of two pre-season named storms in the Atlantic basin since 1951. It moved ashore in North Florida on May29 with winds of 65mph (100km/h), making it the strongest pre-season storm to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. This season marked the first time since 2009 where no tropical cyclones formed in July. Another record was set by Hurricane Nadine later in the season; the system became the fourth-longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, with a <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 22.25days. The final storm to form, Tony, dissipated on October25 – however, Hurricane Sandy, which formed before Tony, became extratropical on October 29.|$|E

25|$|Power outage {{duration}} {{is a measure}} of the reliability of supply to the distribution networks. This measure decreased for most regions in Honduras from 2001.

The <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> interruptions per connection (36 hours per year in 2005, compared to 24 hours in 2004, but 135 hours in 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch) is about twice as high as the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (14 hours per connection in 2005). However, the frequency of such interruptions has been higher in other countries, meaning that Honduras has a few long outages, while other countries have more frequent shorter ones.|$|E
25|$|The most {{comprehensive}} early study of binocular rivalry {{was conducted by}} B. B. Breese (1899, 1909). Breese quantified the amount of rivalry by requiring his observers to press keys while observing rivalry for 100-second trials. An observer pressed one key whenever and {{for as long as}} he or she saw one rival stimulus with no trace of the other, and another key whenever and {{for as long as he}} or she saw the other rival stimulus with no trace of the first. This has come to be known as recording periods of exclusive visibility. From the key-press records (Breese's were made on a kymograph drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average duration of each period of rivalry.|$|E

25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E

40|$|Objectives : sleep {{disturbances}} by GSM-type radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by mobile phone base stations are not well-established. In a previous study, we {{pointed out that}} most effects of RF-EMR were dependent on the thermal environment, suggesting that RF-EMR exposure may modify sleep through interactions with thermoregulatory processes. In the present study, juvenile rats exposed to RF-EMR were allowed to choose their thermal environment corresponding to the 'thermopreferendum'. Methods : 6 Wistar rats (three weeks-old) exposed to RF-EMR during five weeks were compared to a non-exposed control group (n= 4). One week after surgery, sleep was measured (wireless) when animals were allowed to move freely between three similar communicating rooms which differed according to ambient temperature (24, 28 and 31 +- 1 °C). Wakefulness (W), Slow Wave (SWS) and Paradoxical Sleep (PS) were scored at 10 second-periods. The <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> sleep stages, the mean durations and the frequencies of the episodes were tested with ANOVA. Results : exposed rats preferred to sleep at 31 °C whereas the controls preferred 28 °C. The choice of 31 °C induced longer total time sleep (+ 139 and + 103 min compared to 24 and 28 °C respectively) as a result <b>of</b> longer <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> SWS (compared to 24 °C : + 107. 4 min) and of PS (compared to 24 and 28 °C: + 9 and + 7 min respectively). Conclusion : thermopreferendum during sleep was increased when exposed to RF-EMR suggesting modifications of the peripheral thermosensitivity. This observation and the longer sleep duration suggest that the RF-exposed group may develop behavioral responses to prevent energy expenditure...|$|R
