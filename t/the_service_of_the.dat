5|$|A few Gabrades also {{remained}} in the Pontus, where they entered <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire of Trebizond, established by the exiled Komnenoi shortly before {{the dissolution of the}} Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204: most notably, {{a member of the family}} was governor of Sinope during the brief period when it was reclaimed from the Turks by Trebizond (ca. 1254 or 1258/9 – 1265 or 1267/8). Other family members are mentioned as landholders, mostly in the bandon (province) of Matzouka, south of Trebizond: Andronikos Gavras, probably in the 13th century; a George Gabras ca. 1344/5; Kosmas, a military leader (polemarchos) in the bandon of Matzouka ca. 1378; and Theodore Gabras in Gemora in the early 15th century.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC).

Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately {{after the end of the}} war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E

Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. Emperor Basil II accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the doux of Antioch, Bardas Phokas, when he went to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|Although de Lacy {{had spent}} time at Stephen's court, {{during the civil}} war that {{occurred}} during Stephen's reign, he switched sides and served Stephen's rival, Matilda the Empress. In 1138, he was besieged by the king at Weobley along with his cousin Geoffrey Talbot, but both men escaped when the king took the castle in June. De Lacy also led an army in an attack against Bath in <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress, along with Geoffrey Talbot, which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao cultural tradition {{is seen in the}} Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated orchestration, and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry.

This northern route of cultural transmission of the legacy of Liao culture was then returned to China during the Yuan dynasty.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Liberty Bell Savings Bonds {{drive in}} 1950, 55replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard. The bells were to be {{displayed}} and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited {{on the grounds of}} the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school's graduates. Walt Disney World has a replica of the Liberty Bell, which is located in Liberty Square in the Magic Kingdom. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual Liberty Bell in 1989.|$|E
5|$|By 1805, {{during the}} War of the Third Coalition, the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion (1e Legion Polonaise) and {{attached}} to the Kingdom of Italy.

It fought at Castel Franco, turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805, but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant'Eufemia a Maiella.

5|$|Caesar {{served with}} the Mediterranean Fleet after a brief stint in the Channel Fleet.

In <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Home Fleet from 1907, she was placed in reserve in 1912. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Caesar returned to the Channel Fleet before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 after a brief spell as a guard ship at Gibraltar. From 1918 to 1919 she served as a depot ship, firstly in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and then the Black Sea, in support of naval operations against the Bolsheviks. In this latter role, she was the last of the pre-dreadnought battleships to see service outside the United Kingdom. Returning to England in 1920, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
