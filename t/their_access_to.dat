40|$|The Apache™ Hadoop® {{framework}} provides {{parallel processing}} and distributed data storage capabilities that data analytics applications can utilize to process massive sets of raw data. These Big Data applications typically {{run as a}} set of MapReduce jobs to take advantage of Hadoop’s ease of service deployment and large-scale parallelism. Yet, Hadoop has not been adapted for multilevel secure (MLS) environments where data of different security classifications co-exist. To solve this problem, we have used the Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) Linux kernel extension in a prototype cross-domain Hadoop on which multiple instances of Hadoop applications run at different sensitivity levels. <b>Their</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> Hadoop resources are constrained by the underlying MLS policy enforcement mechanism.

5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts <b>their</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of <b>their</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts <b>their</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} naval battles were {{disasters}} for Rome. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine, a Roman naval force {{was able to}} defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval victories followed. The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army. He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy. The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient financial means to raise one. For a maritime power the loss of <b>their</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace.|$|E
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces <b>their</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E

Later, In 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support. In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief.
