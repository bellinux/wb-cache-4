5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of <b>these</b> <b>doctors,</b> Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres is forced to make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. <b>These</b> <b>doctors</b> and Torres buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In {{the aftermath}} of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{humanitarian organisation}} Médecins Sans Frontières originated {{in response to}} the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. <b>These</b> <b>doctors,</b> led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E
25|$|Although suicide {{was officially}} {{accepted}} {{as the cause}} of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in The Guardian, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. <b>These</b> <b>doctors</b> argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the British Medical Journal offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old man with no previous psychiatric history. Nobody else died from that cause during the year.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that <b>these</b> <b>doctors</b> – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E

Some non participating doctors do not take assignment, but they also treat Medicare enrollees and are authorized to balance bill no more than a small fixed amount above Medicare’s approved rate. A minority of doctors are [...] "private contractors," [...] which means they opt out of Medicare and refuse to accept Medicare payments altogether. <b>These</b> <b>doctors</b> are required to inform patients that they will be liable for the full cost of their services out-of-pocket in advance of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons experimenters decide to self-test, but amongst the most {{fundamental}} is the ethical principle that the experimenter should not subject {{the participants in the}} experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves.

[...] Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part.

2500|$|Before the 1920s, {{regulation}} in Britain {{was controlled by}} the pharmacists. Pharmacists that {{were found to have}} prescribed opium for illegitimate causes and anyone found to have sold opium without proper qualifications would be prosecuted. Due to the passing of the Rolleston Act in Britain in 1926, doctors could prescribe opiates such as morphine and heroin on their own accord if they felt their patients demonstrated a medical need. Because addiction was viewed as a medical problem rather than an indulgence, doctors were permitted to allow patients to wean themselves off opiates rather than cutting off any opiate use altogether. The passing of the Rolleston Act put the control of opium use in the hands of medical doctors instead of pharmacists. Later in the 20th century, the addiction to opiates, especially [...] in young people, continued to rise and so the sale and prescription of opiates was limited to doctors in treatment centers. If <b>these</b> <b>doctors</b> were found to be prescribing opiates without just cause, then they could lose their license to practice or prescribe drugs.|$|E

2500|$|The 1966 Doctor's Charter {{introduced}} {{allowances for}} rent and ancillary staff, significantly increased the pay scales, {{and changed the}} structure of payments to reflect [...] "both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i.e. group practice." [...] These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in {{the increased use of}} ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a {{growth in the number of}} health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings. The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds for surgery, rents, and rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs. In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPS (since <b>these</b> <b>doctors,</b> the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, [...] "merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality).|$|E
