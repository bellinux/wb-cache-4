5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at his {{disposal}} a formidable force. His main force on the left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> around Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Zrínyi saw {{action in}} the Adriatic Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for all intents and purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E

5|$|Radetzky {{was built}} by the {{shipbuilding}} company Stabilimento Tecnico in Trieste and commissioned into the fleet on 15 January 1911. The ship conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean before the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914. During the war, Radetzky operated largely {{as part of a}} fleet in being alongside the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; in doing so, the ships <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> considerable naval forces from the Triple Entente. Radetzky did participate in some offensive operations, primarily shore bombardments in the Adriatic Sea against French, Montenegrin, and Italian targets.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans faced {{numerous}} opponents between 1424 and 1453. <b>Tied</b> <b>down</b> by {{the siege}} of Thessalonika, the Ottomans {{had to contend with}} the Serbs under George Brankovic, the Hungarians under John Hunyadi and the Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. This resistance culminated into the Crusade of Varna of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception - a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians - was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard lessons of the Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive strategy would leave all British forces <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on a tightrope. His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had to apply a certain level of destructive power to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|As the 48th Highlanders secured their {{positions}} west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment {{was involved in}} intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions {{to the north of}} San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defences. On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling.|$|E
5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> large Russian forces, preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The AK also fought several {{full-scale}} battles {{against the}} Germans, particularly in 1943 and 1944 during Operation Tempest. They <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> significant German forces, {{worth at least}} several divisions (upper estimates suggest about 930,000 troops), diverting much-needed supplies, while trying to support the Soviet military. Polish intelligence operatives supplied valuable intelligence information to the Allies; 43 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939–45 came from Polish sources. At its height, AK numbered over 400,000 and was {{recognized as one of}} the three largest, or even the largest, resistance movement of the war. Axis fatalities due to the actions of the Polish underground, of which AK formed the bulk, are estimated at up to 150,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Vietnam's {{colonisation}} began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam {{and attempted to}} proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming <b>tied</b> <b>down,</b> they sailed to the less defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River {{to the mouth of}} the Citadel of Saigon and opened fire with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for an entire year.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{vulnerability}} of the Australian shipping industry, the Axis attacks did not seriously affect the Australian or Allied war effort. While the German surface raiders which operated against Australia caused considerable disruption to merchant shipping and <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> Allied naval vessels, they did not sink many ships and only operated in Australian waters for a few short periods. The effectiveness of the Japanese submarine campaign against Australia was limited by the inadequate numbers of submarines committed and flaws in Japan's submarine doctrine. The submarines were, however, successful in forcing the Allies to devote considerable resources to protecting shipping in Australian waters between 1942 and late 1943. The institution of coastal convoys between 1942 and 1943 may have also significantly reduced the efficiency of the Australian shipping industry during this period.|$|E
5|$|From October 1810 Marshal Masséna's Army of Portugal {{had been}} <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> in an {{increasingly}} hopeless stand-off against Wellington's Allied forces, safely entrenched in and behind the Lines of Torres Vedras. Acting on Napoleon's orders, in early 1811 Marshal Soult led a French expedition from Andalusia into Extremadura {{in a bid to}} draw Allied forces away from the Lines and ease Masséna's plight. Napoleon's information was outdated and Soult's intervention came too late; starving and understrength, Masséna's army was already withdrawing to Spain. Soult was able to capture the strategically important fortress at Badajoz on the border between Spain and Portugal from the Spanish, but was forced to return to Andalusia following Marshal Victor's defeat in March at the Battle of Barrosa. However, Soult left Badajoz strongly garrisoned. In April, following news of Masséna's complete withdrawal from Portugal, Wellington sent a powerful Anglo-Portuguese corps commanded by Sir William Beresford to retake the border town. The Allies drove most of the French from the surrounding area and began the Siege of Badajoz.|$|E
5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue in its efforts to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{unexpected}} size of German forces closed off in Stalingrad, on 23 November Stavka (Soviet Armed Forces High Command) decided {{to strengthen the}} outer encirclement preparing to destroy Axis forces {{in and around the}} city. On 24 November, several Soviet formations began to entrench themselves to defend against possible German incursions originating from the West. The Soviets also reinforced the encircling forces in order to prevent a successful breakout operation by the German 6th Army and other Axis units. However, this <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> over ½ of the Red Army's strength in the area. Planning for Operation Saturn began on 25 November, aiming for the destruction of the Italian 8th Army and the severing of communications between German forces west of the Don River and those operating in the Caucasus. Meanwhile, planning also began for Operation Koltso (Ring), which aimed at reducing German forces in the Stalingrad pocket.|$|E
5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. In the gloom and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been <b>tied</b> <b>down</b> below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E
