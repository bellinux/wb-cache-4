All those in the circle who had not {{come in from the}} college with gowns and caps, and one or two even of them, deliberately took off their outer clothing, and tied it up in bundles. These bundles they removed to various corners, so that each might again find his own clothes. One or two put on calico dressing-gowns, which appeared to have been placed ready for the purpose; and among these was the cadaverous man of the black hair.|$|E

40|$|In a {{maternity}} {{hospital in}} which the umbilicus and trunk of healthy newborn infants were treated with 0 · 33 % hexachlorophane dusting powder, the hexachlorophane content of blood was measured in mothers before delivery, in infants' umbilical samples at birth, and at 8 days of age in capillary blood samples. One mother and her baby had rather high blood concentrations of hexachlorophane, probably derived from a <b>toilet</b> <b>preparation</b> used before admission to hospital. Hexachlorophane was absent or barely detectable in the other mothers' blood and in the infants' umbilical blood. The hexachlorophane concentrations {{in the blood of}} 8 -day-old infants ranged from nil to 0 · 166 μg. /ml. (mean 0 · 066 μg. /ml.). These were much less than the concentrations reported to be toxic in animals...|$|R

They had stopped; and he thought that he could perceive, by means of his glass, that they were painting their faces, and otherwise arranging their <b>toilets,</b> in <b>preparation</b> for the anticipated interview. On receiving this information we took our seats at table, expecting to be ready to receive the chiefs, as soon as they should arrive.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} August attempt, the escape {{was led by}} ETA, who carried out a {{detailed}} study of the prison to identify weak points which could be exploited in an escape. They concluded that the prison's drainage system would offer the best chance and began searching for {{the quickest way to}} access it. Tests on the prison's walls revealed a hollow space behind the <b>toilets</b> and <b>preparations</b> for the escape attempt began in October 1975. Using a piece of metal taken from the prison's lumberyard, the prisoners removed six tiles to create a crawl space, through which they could access the hollow space and begin tunnelling. To hide their work, they replaced the tiles and built a concealed door. Other prisoners assisted in the escape by making noise during the periods when the excavation of the tunnel was taking place.|$|R

On the first floor there are two simulated airlocks, a shower and <b>toilet,</b> an EVA <b>Preparation</b> room for storage and maintenance of the simulated space suits and their associated equipment, and a combined science lab and engineering work area. The laboratory is shared between the Crew Geologist and the Crew Biologist and includes an autoclave, analytical balance, microscope, and a stock of chemicals and reagents for conducting biochemical tests. On the second floor are six very small private crew staterooms with bunks and a small reading desk, a common dining and entertainment area, a dedicated communications station and a galley or kitchen equipped with a gas stove, refrigerator, microwave, oven and a sink for meal preparations. Above the six crew staterooms is a Loft which contains the internal fresh water storage tank and equipment storage space. At the peak of the HAB's dome shaped roof is an access hatch to permit maintenance access to the satellite antenna and weather monitoring instruments.|$|R

These actions were dually audacious, especially the use of her family name and crest on her products. People of her class were appalled at such indiscretions, but Harriet understood that it actually encouraged women who aspired to a higher social status to purchase her products. Her products included creams, balms, scents, brushes, soaps and more which brought in over one million dollars a year. She used much of her earnings for interesting advertisements, paid endorsements by famous entertainers, and for advertorials. Her advertising acuity led to her commercial success.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary and Incomplete (please do not cite {{without the}} authors ’ permission) In this paper we analyze {{aspects of the}} {{intellectual}} property strategies of firms in the global cosmetics and <b>toilet</b> <b>preparations</b> industry. Using detailed data on all 4, 205 EPO patent grants in the relevant IPC class between 1980 and 2001, we find that about 15 percent of all patents are challenged in EPO opposition proceedings, a rate about {{twice as high as}} in the overall population of EPO patents. Moreover, opposition in this sector is more frequent than in chemicals-based high technology industries such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. About one third of the opposition cases involve multiple opponents. We search for rationales that could explain this surprisingly strong “IP litigation ” activity. In a first step, we use simple probability models to analyze the likelihood of opposition as a function of characteristics of the attacked patent. We then introduce owner firm variables and find that major differences across firms in the likelihood of having their patents opposed prevail even after accounting for other influences. Aggressive opposition in th...|$|E
