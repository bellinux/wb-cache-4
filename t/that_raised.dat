5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s {{as he began to}} identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of the}} state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> a point of law, and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The Chief Justice also appointed the Clerk of the Warrants, Clerk of the Treasury (also known as the Clerk of Hell), the Keeper of the Seal, the Clerk of Essoins and the Clerk of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own clerk, rather than that of the court), as well as other officials. The Custos Brevium appointed the Clerk of the Juries, responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus.|$|E
5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
5|$|In January 1981, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{planted a}} bomb in the Suvla barrack block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was {{discovered}} and the 35RAF musicians and 15airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations was reviewed. The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the Falklands War. The station went on to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 1987 by staging several events <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> £30,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{played an}} active role in the 2008 {{government}} conflict with the agricultural sector, when Cristina Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> custom taxes to soybean exports to 44%. At that time, he became president of the Justicialist Party and publicly supported his wife in the conflict; Kirchner accused the agricultural sector of attempting a coup d'état. He spoke in support of a bill to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} KB-4, the surface ship design bureau of the Baltic Shipyard, was {{selected}} for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening of the deck armor <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by Premier Stalin at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to begin again.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|There were a {{few major}} {{accidents}} {{in the history of}} the MRT <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> safety concerns among the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil spillage on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.|$|E
5|$|Wade also {{discusses}} {{the origin of}} Jews; they descend from the Middle East through their Y chromosomes, but their mitochondrial DNA resembles that of their host countries. Citing Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, Wade argues that Ashkenazi Jews were historically forced into intellectually demanding occupations by their European hosts, and these selective pressures favoured genes <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> their intelligence. The consequence of this, however, {{was an increase in}} sphingolipid diseases. The final chapter, Evolution, gives a summary of human evolution from its origins to the present, and declares that it is unlikely that it will ever cease. Wade speculates where evolution will lead humans in the future, suggesting further skeletal gracilisation, increases in intelligence, adaptations to the changing climate, and even the possibility of speciation.|$|E

In September 2007, he held an auction <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> 965,000U.S. dollars (6.75million yuan), and competed in a charity basketball match to raise money for underprivileged children in China. He was joined by fellow NBA stars Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, and Baron Davis, and movie star Jackie Chan. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Yao donated $2million to relief work, and created a foundation to help rebuild schools destroyed in the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Accenture {{estimated}} that the World Cup opening would bring R$30.75Billion over 10 years to the city's economy; the study's results encouraged Brazil to site the opening match in São Paulo. A study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas estimated R$1Billion in revenue during the World Cup, as 290 thousand tourists were expected for the event. After Morumbi Stadium was deemed unsuitable by FIFA, the Local World Cup Committee looked for alternatives and set on offering Arena Corinthians to host the opening game; FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Hosting the opening game required modifications to the project <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> the cost from the original R$335million to R$1.07billion to accommodate FIFA's requirements. Cuts in equipment, furniture and construction costs reduced the cost. Because of FIFA's agreements with Brazil, none of the construction work related to the World Cup was taxed by the Federal Government; the final price agreed upon was R$820million.|$|E
5|$|After heavy {{damage from}} Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the {{government}} of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation. The storm had cut communications in some areas, but by January29, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara. Following the storm, the Madagascar government coordinated the distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items. On January27, the government launched a fundraiser on television <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> over ₣130million (FMG, $30,000 USD). The southern portion {{of the country was}} declared a disaster area. A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized the slow pace of relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed. In addition, there were reports that government aid was being stolen by looters.|$|E

5|$|David Murray {{acquired}} {{control of}} Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} of adding a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> $132 million.|$|E
5|$|SCPA {{had three}} {{different}} homes {{in its first}} four years, including a makeshift campus in the Mount Adams neighborhood and another in Roselawn. In 1976, it occupied the Old Woodward High School building, {{on the site of}} one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered {{in the years that followed}} and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. A new facility in Over-the-Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public-private partnership <b>that</b> <b>raised</b> over $31million in private contributions to match public funding.
