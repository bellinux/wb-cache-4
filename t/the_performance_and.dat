5|$|VERA is a {{light water}} reactor {{simulation}} written at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers to monitor <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> status of any part of a reactor core throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although {{not one of the}} first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. Computer scientist Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's hybrid architecture was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E
