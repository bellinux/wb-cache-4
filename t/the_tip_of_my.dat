2500|$|Tip of {{the tongue}} (or TOT) is the {{phenomenon}} of failing to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent. The phenomenon's name comes from the saying, [...] "It's on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue." [...] The tip {{of the tongue}} phenomenon reveals that lexical access occurs in stages.|$|E
2500|$|Iniesta {{sustained}} another injury {{during a}} home match against Málaga, but returned to {{action for the}} first leg Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, which Barcelona won 4–0. He scored a vital equaliser {{in the final minute}} of stoppage time during the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, with a curling strike with the outside of his right foot 25 yards from goal, securing the tie on away goals as the match finished 1–1. In the season review, Un Any Al Paradis, Iniesta wrote, [...] "I connected with that shot with the outside, not the inside or <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boot, but right from my heart, with all my might." ...|$|E

60|$|There stood Adam, in {{his black}} tail-coat rubbing his arm; and there the showman. Still to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, I sat motionless, gazing up into the hard, high-boned, narrow-browed face with its small restless eyes voraciously taking me in. Fortunately the choked beating <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart was too small a sound for his ear; {{and he was the}} first to {{withdraw}} from the encounter.|$|R

60|$|I did {{not dare}} do {{anything}} which would cause the sentry to be curious, or be noticed particularly by those who were passing in either direction, therefore the most I ventured was to drum idly on the glass with <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, which was not a difficult task since the iron bars were so far apart that I could thrust my entire arm {{between them and the}} window-sash.|$|R

60|$|Oh, believe me, we were amazingly simple. But we {{did know}} a lot that is not known to-day. We could twitch our ears, prick them up and flatten them down at will. And we could scratch between our {{shoulders}} with ease. We could throw stones with our feet. I have done it many a time. And for that matter, I could keep my knees straight, bend forward from the hips, and touch, not <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, but <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> <b>my</b> elbows, to the ground. And as for bird-nesting--well, I only wish the twentieth-century boy could see us. But we made no collections of eggs. We ate them.|$|R
60|$|An angry speech curled <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue. But the simple-faced {{flowers were}} slowly making obeisance to Mrs Bowater's black, {{dragging}} skirts, {{and when she}} was nearly out of sight I sallied out to confront my stranger.|$|E

500|$|Eisenberg has obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and is open about it. He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – I {{have to make sure}} all parts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feet touch the ground equally before I touch that new thing. So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|R

6000|$|I {{shall never}} forget the first time I saw it. I had dined alone downstairs. I never drink wine, so that what {{happened}} was eminently normal. It was in the summer twilight that I returned to the study. I glanced at the desk. There he was, sitting. So natural was it, that before I knew I cried out [...] "Jim!" [...] Then I remembered all that had happened. Of course it was an hallucination. I knew that. I took the poker {{and went over to}} it. He did not move nor vanish. The poker cleaved through the non-existent substance of the thing and struck the back of the chair. Fabric of fancy, that is all it was. The mark is there on the chair now where the poker struck.

5000|$|I wrote {{all night}} long, {{seven days a}} week, single space, no paragraphs, front and back of the pages, {{pounding}} the keys so hard <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers would hurt. I couldn't stop writing, and I remember feeling more alive than I had ever felt. Convinced that I was destined to die young, I struggled to leave something of meaning behind, {{to rise above the}} darkness and despair. I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war — to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward — not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence.

60|$|It was on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{tongue to}} ask Hiram {{if he had}} made a mistake in regard to the {{gathering}} of the Minute Boys, and then I realized that Silas had taken the precaution to keep all the company out of sight except these two, who appeared to be standing watch.|$|E

60|$|It was on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{tongue to}} say that I thought I had met with him before. But there was {{something}} in his face, and something in my own recollections--I can hardly say what--which unaccountably restrained me from speaking and which as unaccountably attracted me to him at once, and made me feel ready and glad to accept his proposal.|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON (with conviction). Because {{you would}} have wanted my letter enough to bear your fear. There is only one {{universal}} passion: fear. Of all the thousand qualities a man may have, the only one you will find as certainly in the youngest drummer boy in my army as in me, is fear. It is fear that makes men fight: it is indifference that makes them run away: fear is the mainspring of war. Fear! I know fear well, better than you, better than any woman. I once saw a regiment of good Swiss soldiers massacred by a mob in Paris because I was afraid to interfere: I felt myself a coward to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> toes as I looked on at it. Seven months ago I revenged my shame by pounding that mob to death with cannon balls. Well, what of that? Has fear ever held a man back from anything he really wanted--or a woman either? Never. Come with me; and I will show you twenty thousand cowards who will risk death {{every day for the}} price of a glass of brandy. And do you think there are no women in the army, braver than the men, because their lives are worth less? Psha! I think nothing of your fear or your bravery. If you had had to come across to me at Lodi, you would not have been afraid: once on the bridge, every other feeling would have gone down before the necessity--the necessity--for making your way to my side and getting what you wanted.|$|R
60|$|There {{are times}} when wild {{thoughts}} enter a man's heart, when he seems almost irresponsible for his act and his deed. The Captain stood on the weather-side of the deck. Sideways, on an unobstructed line with him, was {{the opening of the}} lee-gangway, where the side-ladders are suspended in port. Nothing but a slight bit of sinnate-stuff served to rail in this opening, which was cut right down {{to the level of the}} Captain's feet, showing the far sea beyond. I stood a little to windward of him, and, though he was a large, powerful man, it was certain that a sudden rush against him, along the slanting deck, would infallibly pitch him headforemost into the ocean, though he who so rushed must needs go over with him. My blood seemed clotting in my veins; I felt icy cold at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, and a dimness was before my eyes. But through that dimness the boatswain's mate, scourge in hand, loomed like a giant, and Captain Claret, and the blue sea seen through the opening at the gangway, showed with an awful vividness. I cannot analyse my heart, though it then stood still within me. But the thing that swayed me to my purpose was not altogether the thought that Captain Claret was about to degrade me, and that I had taken an oath with my soul that he should not. No, I felt my man's manhood so bottomless within me, that no word, no blow, no scourge of Captain Claret could cut me deep enough for that. I but swung to an instinct in me--the instinct diffused through all animated nature, the same that prompts even a worm to turn under the heel. Locking souls-with him, I meant to drag Captain Claret from this earthly tribunal of his to that of Jehovah and let Him decide between us. No other way could I escape the scourge.|$|R

I was feeling so little generous that if I had known {{something}} then of his mother’s allusion to ‘white geese’ I would have {{advised him to}} get one of them and lead it away on a beautiful blue ribbon. Mrs. Blunt was wrong, you know, to be so scornful. A white goose is exactly what her son wants. But look how badly the world is arranged. Such white birds cannot be got for nothing and he has not enough money even to buy a ribbon. Who knows! Maybe it was this which gave that tragic quality to his pose by the mantelpiece over there. Yes, that was it. Though no doubt I didn’t see it then. As he didn’t offer to move after I had done speaking I became quite unaffectedly sorry and advised him very gently to dismiss me from his mind definitely. He moved forward then and said to me in his usual voice and with his usual smile {{that it would have been}} excellent advice but unfortunately I was one of those women who can’t be dismissed at will. And as I shook my head he insisted rather darkly: ‘Oh, yes, Doña Rita, it is so. Cherish no illusions about that fact.’ It sounded so threatening that in my surprise I didn’t even acknowledge his parting bow. He went out of that false situation like a wounded man retreating after a fight. No, I have nothing to reproach myself with. I did nothing. I led him into nothing. Whatever illusions have passed through my head I kept my distance, and he was so loyal to what he seemed to think the redeeming proprieties of the situation that he has gone from me for good without so much as kissing <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers. He must have felt like a man who had betrayed himself for nothing. It’s horrible. It’s the fault of that enormous fortune of mine, and I wish with all my heart that I could give it to him; for he couldn’t help his hatred of the thing that is: and as to his love, which is just as real, well—could I have rushed away from him to shut myself up in a convent? Could I? After all I have a right to <b>my</b> share <b>of</b> daylight.” ...|$|R
