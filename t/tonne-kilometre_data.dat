30|$|The {{total number}} of {{allowances}} allocated to each aircraft operator {{will be determined by}} a benchmark which is calculated in three consecutive steps: First, the share of auctioned allowances is subtracted from the overall “cap”. Second, the remaining CO 2 -emissions will be divided by the sum of verified <b>tonne-kilometre</b> <b>data</b> for flights falling under the geographical scope of the EU-ETS in the monitoring year 2010, as reported by all participating aircraft operators. Third, the specific amount of allowances each operator receives is calculated by multiplying the respective individual tonne-kilometre value of the monitoring year with the benchmark. Each operator’s revenue tonne-kilometres are calculated by multiplying the mission distance (great-circle-distance plus an additional fixed surcharge of 95  km) by the payload transported (cargo, mail and passengers). For the calculation of the performed tonne-kilometres, each passenger including baggage is assigned a value of 100  kg.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the overall {{incremental}} accident risks of LHD HGV’s while driving in the RHD environment in Great Britain, a relative risk analysis in terms of Odds Ratio Analysis was undertaken with respect to relative annual vehicle-km driven by UK registered HGV’s as against foreign registered HGV’s, number of reported road accidents involving (i) at least one heavy goods vehicle and (ii) at least one foreign registered heavy goods vehicle in Great Britain in a typical year. The relevant <b>tonne-kilometres</b> and vehicle-kilometres <b>data</b> for UK registered as well as foreign registered vehicles were derived from DfT Road Freight Statistics [7] as revised in 2008 [10], and corresponding accident data for HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were collected from DfT’s annual publication ‘Road Casualties Great Britain’ in from [6] to 2008. The Odds Ratios, which are equivalent to relative risks, for personal injury accidents of LHD HGV’s while driving in left side in the UK were estimated in relation to proportional annual vehicle-km driven. The average Odds Ratios for slight injury, serious injury and fatal accidents for LHD HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were 1.69, 1.16 and 1.10 respectively. This implies that the LHD HGV’s were 69  %, 16  % and 10  % more at risk of participating a slight injury, serious injury and a fatal accident respectively than RHD HGV’s in the UK. The weighted average Odds Ratio for personal injury accident was 1.61 indicating that relative risk of driving LHD HGV’s having opposite steering wheel control was 61  % higher in comparison to RHD HGV’s in the UK. The same relative incremental risks for personal injury (+ 61  %) and fatal (+ 10  %) accidents were adopted {{in the present study}} for determination of accident impacts of HGV’s, having opposite-side steering wheel control, in Rwanda.|$|R
