2500|$|The <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> {{individual}} {{stories and}} customs within a family depends {{for the most}} part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up <b>items</b> <b>of</b> family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>items</b> can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as [...] "multi-conduit transmission". By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} research that documents and describes how environmental knowledge and land skills are being generated and transmitted among Inuit in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada. In previous {{research in the}} Arctic, Inuit have expressed concern {{that as a result}} of rapid societal changes, the traditional modes <b>of</b> intergenerational knowledge <b>transmission</b> by which Inuit have developed the skills to hunt safely and successfully no longer function effectively. Younger generation Inuit are spending considerably less time involved in subsistence activities beyond organized land-camps and occasional hunting trips but comparatively more time engaged in formal education and wage employment. This has implications for culture, health and well-being, and for adaptation to changing climatic conditions. The <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> 92 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> Inuit environmental knowledge and land skills was studied with a sample of 42 Inuit males between the ages 18 and 49 years in Ulukhaktok (approximately 50 % of the potential sample). Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, free-listing and pile sorts. The general objectives of the interviews were to learn if an informant had learned a particular skill, if yes, who was their major teacher, how did they learn this skill, how old were they when they learned the skill, and what factors helped facilitate or impede transmission. The results are expected to inform initiatives to help facilitate the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> land skills and related environmental knowledge, many already underway, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and elsewhere in the Arctic...|$|R

We target applications that continuously query the data sources and manipulate {{a large amount}} of query results.

To deal with the skewed load distribution, we also provide load balancing mechanisms to ensure that no node in the system is unduly loaded. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture can efficiently distribute the query processing in the network and significantly reduce the number of queries evaluated on the data source nodes.

40|$|Data {{broadcast}} {{has been}} suggested as a promising method of information dissemination [1, 15]. In such an environment, the information server cannot afford to serve the requests from a large population of users individually. Instead, the server uses a broadcast channel to deliver information to all users. A single <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a data <b>item</b> satisfies all pending requests for that item. The response time of a request depends on the broadcast time of the desired data item, which is scheduled by the server according to the overall demands for various data items. Therefore, the response time may vary in a large range. We argue that, in addition to mean response time, the variance of response time should also {{be taken into account}} by the broadcast scheduler. In this paper, we address the issue of variance optimization in regard to response time. Building on our previous research on mean response time optimization, we propose an algorithm which can minimize the variance of response time. Fur [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The term 'English Riddle Ballad' {{is taken}} here to {{describe}} the six items in Child's collection of English and Scottish popular ballads which have become known as such: Child numbers 1, 2, 3, 45, 46 and 47. All these ballads are in the English language, and all contain some sort of questions which do not have direct answers; beyond this, the group is not a homogenous one in age, place, form or content. For each ballad, as many variants as possible have been assembled and are described chronologically in Appendices. By {{an examination of the}} whole corpus of texts, this thesis traces, within the limitations of the material, the history and <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> each <b>item.</b> At the same time, the various relationships with cultural and historical backgrounds are explored. The tunes have been arranged in groups to help in identifying patterns <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> In particular, the nature and effects of the riddling element in each case is investigated, and a separate chapter (8) goes on to compare and analyse these as poetic structures. This chapter also puts forward a definition of riddling based on the mental processes involved, rather than on the linguistic form of the riddle itself; this avoids the problems of former definitions of the genre which exclude much material that is traditionally and instinctively classed as riddle. According to this definition, however, only four of the six 'Riddle Ballads' can be said to contain true riddling elements. A final chapter brings the ballads into alignment with modern anthropological studies of the riddle, describing other contexts in which riddling occurs, and evaluating the achievements of this limited but intriguing genre...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Information is {{the first}} step in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) prevention. Ignorance about the disease and how the virus is transmitted can generate fear and prejudice towards those who are infected. AIM: To assess the awareness, attitudes, and beliefs of the general public toward HIV/AIDS in Hyderabad, the capital city of Andhra Pradesh. SETTING AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted for a period of 2 months in 2004 on 800 individuals living in Hyderabad. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was conducted with a questionnaire titled &#x 2032;General Population Behavioral Surveillance Survey. &#x 2032; The survey used a 5 -part, 65 -item questionnaire eliciting information about the knowledge <b>of</b> HIV (10 <b>items),</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> (20 <b>items),</b> ways <b>of</b> prevention (10 <b>items),</b> society&#x 2032;s attitude toward HIV (15 items), and finally evaluation of Government&#x 2032;s measures (10 items). RESULTS: Approximately 80. 63 &#x 0025; (645 / 800) of the study population were sketchily aware of HIV/AIDS, but had incorrect perceptions about the mode <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> or prevention. Despite the vigorous outreach programmes, which the government and other organizations had carried out in the city, many people had several misconceptions about HIV or about people living with HIV/AIDS.

Protecting digital product is going to become important issue to ensure the secure <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> the digital <b>items.</b> The existing algorithms cannot guarantee the whole security of the contents or ownership verification. The embedded watermark or data hiding into image can be used to identify the owner of the image. Also, The Block Truncation Coding (BTC) is one of the effective and real time application for data hiding. Most present BTC based watermarking methods cannot completely exploit visual perception of the cover images and do not obtain high data embedding rate. For more exploiting visual perception and high data embedding, an enhanced data hiding scheme based on BTC is proposed. In proposed method, considering the texture sub blocks and Least Significant Bits (LSBs of higher mean value and lower mean value) substitution combine together for designing improved the BTC watermarking scheme. It can obtain good balance between high embedding rate (capacity) and high quality. So, the texture sensitivity is exploited to recognize whether the image blocks or are smooth or complex. On the other hand, the LSB substitution method is employed to hide the indicator bits of each image block or sub block. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases capacity of data hiding compare to existing BTC watermarking with the same or higher quality...|$|R
