30|$|External factors, {{beyond the}} control of the {{entrepreneurs}} and enterprises, have vital impacts on the performance of the enterprises. Demand for the product/service is found to be positively influencing the performance of <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> (Wiklund 1998). Growing demand for the products/services of <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> acts as an impetus to grow. As it has been found that <b>the</b> young <b>firms</b> grow faster than older <b>firms,</b> <b>the</b> younger <b>firms</b> might be intolerable to intense competition. Therefore, it makes sense that competition negatively affects the performance of <b>the</b> <b>firms.</b> Theoretically, it may be true that if there is intense competition <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> will have more motivation to grow (Nickell et al. 1997) but this might be different for <b>the</b> young <b>firms</b> or emerging firms as not supported by Malaysian data. The coefficient for space to expand in the city area is positive suggesting that if the physical spaces are made available to <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> in <b>the</b> city area firms’ growth will be higher. Financing is another important aspect of <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> to perform better. Accessibility to the sources of fund and the adequacy of the secured funds affect the performance of <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> positively. If <b>the</b> sources of funds are easily available and the amount is sufficient <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> will have <b>the</b> higher stimulus to grow (Xavier et al. 2010).|$|R

The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> as a partner.

In contrast to the previous literature, we consider the case where <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> are short side and all expected match surplus is taken by <b>the</b> <b>firms.</b> Since <b>the</b> expected level of competence in the second hand market is {{lower than that of}} original workers, <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> have an incentive to keep their original workers. For this purpose, <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> may offer them a high wage in advance to prevent them from quitting. However, since the low average quitting rate of the economy results in the low expected competence in the second hand market, it makes <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> 2 ̆ 7 incentive higher to keep the workers inside <b>the</b> <b>firms.</b> These strategic complementarities among <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> may lead to the multiple equilibria of labor market.

Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E
30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce {{complementary}} services, simulations {{indicate that}} the difference between Cournot and Bertrand prices is reduced when the degree of complementarity between the services decreases. The relationship is inconclusive when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce substitutes. In the special case when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> disregard consumer surplus (γ[*]=[*] 0), increasing β leads to a greater difference in prices between Cournot and Bertrand, both when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce complementary services (s[*]<[*] 0) and substitutes (s[*]>[*] 0). When γ[*]>[*] 0, the influence on Ψ when β increases is ambiguous. Finally, the more weight <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> put on consumer surplus (γ increases) the greater is the difference between Cournot prices and Bertrand prices when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce complementary services. When they produce substitutes it is, however, ambiguous how more weight placed on consumer surplus will influence Ψ.|$|R
30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce substitutable (complementary) services, the collusive {{price is}} always higher (lower) than {{prices in the}} {{competitive}} situations.

Also when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> produce substitutes (s[*]>[*] 0) and are not concerned about consumer surplus (γ[*]=[*] 0), the usual result arises that Bertrand prices are lowest regardless of <b>the</b> weight <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> place on revenues. However, when <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> place sufficiently great weight on consumer surplus (γ is large), rather low weight on revenues (β is low) and compete to a moderate degree (s is positive but low), it is demonstrated that Bertrand prices can reach a higher level than Cournot prices.|$|R
