40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} optimal tests for {{circular}} reflective symmetry about a fixed median direction. The distributions against which optimality is achieved are the so-called k-sine-skewed distributions of Umbach and Jammalamadaka (2009). We first show that sequences of k-sine-skewed models are locally and asymptotically normal {{in the vicinity}} of reflective symmetry. Following the Le Cam methodology, we then construct optimal (in the maximin sense) parametric tests for reflective symmetry, which we render semi-parametric by a studentization argument. These asymptotically distribution-free tests happen to be uniformly optimal (under any reference density) and are moreover of a very simple and intuitive form. They furthermore exhibit nice small sample properties, as we show through a Monte Carlo simulation study. Our new tests also allow us to re-visit the famous red wood ants data set of Jander (1957). We further show that one of the proposed parametric tests can as well serve as a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniformity</b> against cardioid alternatives; this test coincides with the famous circular Rayleigh (1919) <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniformity</b> which is thus proved to be (also) optimal against cardioid alternatives. Moreover, our choice of k-sine-skewed alternatives, which are the circular analogues of the classical linear skew-symmetric distributions, permits us a Fisher singularity analysis à la Hallin and Ley (2012) with the result that only the prominent sine-skewed von Mises distribution suffers from these inferential drawbacks.

Since the scan statistics are based on the highly dependent consecutive subsequences of observed data, accurate probability inequalities for their distributions are of great value. We derive accurate second-order Bonferroni-type inequalities for the distribution of linear and circular scan statistics. Our approach is based on the scanning window representation of scan statistics. Both the one-dimensional continuous and discrete cases are investigated. Based on the numerical results presented in this article, it is evident that the Bonferroni-type inequalities are tight. For all practical purposes, they determine the scan statistics probabilities used in testing. Based on the probability inequalities for the distribution of scan statistics accurate inequalities for the expected size of a possible cluster are derived. Numerical results presented in this article indicate that these inequalities are tight; thus, providing valuable information on the expected size of the largest cluster of events.

Concrete admixtures need to be tested by creating standard concrete mix designs in which the admixture is added {{to see if it}} enhances the desired concrete property and achieved the required specifications. Once the admixtures is qualified and approved, subsequent testing is required to confirm uniformity and equivalency of the product so that it will produce the same effects on concrete as originally approved. ASTM C 494 /C 494 M- 11 specifies infrared scanning (IR) as one method to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniformity</b> and equivalency.

The UK is served by seven specialist pulmonary hypertension centres and, consequently, there are regions which {{do not have a}} specialist unit. Since 2000, Papworth Hospital (Papworth Everard, UK) has been the sole PEA provider for the UK, offering the opportunity to study the national incidence of operable disease and give potential insight into factors that might affect geographical distribution within the UK.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aims of {{the study}} were (1) to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniformity</b> of {{distribution}} of childhood leukaemias and other malignancies; and (2) to consider the aetiological implications of unusual distributions. DESIGN [...] A test for spacial clustering was applied using a method which allows for unequal distribution of the population at risk and avoids using census data to provide population denominators. When clustering was identified, four possible aetiological links which had already been suggested to the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre were examined in a local area. SETTING [...] The study was carried out in the Yorkshire Health Region in the north of England. PATIENTS [...] 144 children under 15 years of age with a diagnosis of malignant disease known to the Yorkshire Regional Childhood Tumour Registry between 1974 and 1986 were included in the analysis. Of these 53 had leukaemias and nine had lymphomas. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS [...] Significant localised clustering was found in North Humberside, though not in the whole of the Yorkshire Health Region. A number of clustered cases were identified, some of whom were in a post code sector, Hull 10, to the west of Kingston-upon-Hull, about which concern had been expressed since 1985. There was however no evidence that disease clustering was confined to this area. Four previously suggested hypotheses about causation in this particular area were examined but the results were negative or inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS [...] The identification of spacial clustering must be seen as only {{the first step in a}} series of investigations; it can only rarely lead to aetiological conclusions by itself, but it can motivate and target other investigations...|$|E
40|$|What is the {{probability}} that a random triangle is acute? We explore this old question from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape theory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six vertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to four by translation of the center to (0, 0) or reformulation as a 2 × 2 random matrix problem. In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide audience. We hope to encourage others to look again (and differently) at triangles. We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a central result of shape theory: triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere. We give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly distributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A new proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers. Generalizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the “square root ellipticity statistic” of random matrix theory. Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of 2 × 2 matrices. A new theorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many triangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight into both. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of random matrix theory.

40|$|The European Union (EU) <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniformity</b> of dosage units using {{large sample}} sizes was {{published}} in European Pharmacopoeia 7. 7 in 2012. There are 2 alternative tests. Option 1 is a parametric two-sided tolerance interval-based method modified with an indiffer-ence zone and counting units outside of (0. 75 M, 1. 25 M) (here, M is defined by sample mean, X, as M 98. 5 % if X 101. 5 %, and M X otherwise). Option 2 is a nonparametric counting method with an additional indifference-zone concept. The authors extended the parametric two one-sided tolerance interval-based method that was proposed for dose content uniformity testing based on 30 tablets to large sample sizes with the restriction that all operating characteristic curves of the two one-sided tolerance intervals for any given sample size intersect with the operating characteristic curve of the US Pharmacopoeia harmonized method for a sample size of 30 at the acceptance probability of 90 % when the individual tablets with on-target mean {{are assumed to be}} normally distributed. This paper studies the acceptance probabilities in relation to the batch mean and batch stan-dard deviation among the 2 EU options and the authors ’ proposed method. The acceptance probabilities of EU options 1 and 2 and the proposed method were compared using simulation; results revealed that both EU options 1 and 2 produce larger acceptance probabilities when the batch mean is off-target.
