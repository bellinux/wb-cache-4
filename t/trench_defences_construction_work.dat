Wessex Water Authority estimated {{the total cost of}} the damage caused at £6M. This resulted in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment, repair and improvement. With 400 properties affected in Burnham-on-Sea, after emergency repairs, Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea <b>defences.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>work</b> started in 1983 on a £7M scheme, creating what was then Britain’s biggest wave return wall.|$|R

50|$|The initial British success {{showed that}} even the strongest <b>trench</b> <b>defences</b> could be {{overcome}} by a surprise attack {{using a combination of}} new methods and equipment, reflecting a general increase in the British capacity to combine infantry, artillery, tanks and aircraft in attacks. The German revival after the shock of the British attack improved German morale but the potential for similar attacks meant that the Germans had to divert resources to anti-tank defences and weapons, an extra demand that the Germans could ill afford to meet.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{variations}} in soft cliff retreat {{and the impact}} of coastal defences along 55 km of the Holderness coast between 1845 and 2005. The analysis of three approximately 50 -year periods (1854 – 1905, 1905 – 1952, 1952 – 2005) gives a retreat rate of between 0. 8 ± 0. 4 m/yr and 2. 1 ± 0. 4 m/yr. Retreat varies spatially and temporally due to natural causes and human activity, especially 19 th century beach mining and coastal <b>defence</b> <b>construction.</b> <b>Defences</b> reduce sediment input and modify the sediment budget, usually resulting in a sediment deficit down-drift, leading {{to the development of a}} set-back. Using data from historical and modern Ordnance Survey maps, aerial photographs, and Differential Geographical Positioning System(DGPS) surveys, the cliff top was selected as a reference feature. Set-back due to <b>defence</b> <b>construction</b> at Barmston, Hornsea (two periods),Mappleton and Withernsea (two periods) was analysed, giving six different time periods. Short time periods are unreliable due to large mapping uncertainties and natural variability. Two cases showed excess retreat for tens to thousands of metres down-drift over a long time period since <b>defence</b> <b>construction.</b> Two cases were indicative of excess retreat, but require more time to elapse after <b>defence</b> <b>construction</b> (in these cases > 20 years) to reach a definitive conclusion. Two cases were inconclusive, but possibly maintained a constant retreat rate post-defence construction. Hence, at the scale of Holderness, defences have changed the pattern of erosion rather than stopping it. Accelerated retreat down-drift of defences can threaten human infrastructure and buildings and reduce the efficiency of defences. This should be recognized in shoreline management planning...|$|R

50|$|The advance {{produced}} an awkward salient and a surprise German counter-offensive began on 30 November, which drove back the British {{in the south}} and failed in the north. Despite the reversal, the attack was seen as a success by the Allies, proving that tanks could overcome <b>trench</b> <b>defences.</b> The Germans realised that the use of tanks by the Allies posed a new threat to any defensive strategy they might mount. The battle had also seen the first mass use of German stosstruppen on the Western front in the attack, who used infantry infiltration tactics to penetrate British defences, bypassing resistance and quickly advancing into the British rear.|$|R

Regression analysis is used in measuring a contractor’s competitiveness between bids (by using the lowest bid / own bid ratio) and within bids (by using the lowest bid / cost estimate ratio) according to type and size of <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client type.
