5|$|The {{hurricane}} season officially began on June15, 1962. The National Hurricane Center began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve {{with the existing}} equipment. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> access {{to a system of}} radars that extended from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes. The season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{began on}} June15, the date that the Weather Bureau office in Miami, Florida, under the {{direction}} of Gordon Dunn, began daily monitoring of all tropical disturbances and cyclones across the northern Atlantic Ocean. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> access to the Hurricane Hunters, a fleet of aircraft that obtain data by flying into storms. The Weather Bureau, in collaboration with other agencies, began a fiveyear project in 1956 to obtain and analyze data on the structure of hurricanes. The season officially ended on November15.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, {{unemployment}} exceeded 25% statewide. Southern Indiana {{was hard}} hit, and unemployment topped 50% during the worst years. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) began operations in Indiana in July 1935. By October of that year, <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> put 74,708 Hoosiers to work. In 1940, {{there were still}} 64,700 people working for agency. The majority of these workers were employed to improve the state's infrastructure: roads, bridges, flood control projects, and water treatment plants. Some helped index collections of libraries, and artists were employed to create murals for post offices and libraries. Nearly every community had a project to work on.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>had</b> produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E

5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, {{leaving the}} agency with 92 vacant positions {{that needed to}} be filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left the agency, some retiring routinely, others leaving due to increased workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and still is not, as of January 2015. Computers were also in short supply, and the few that were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat died of natural causes (without explaining which) and <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E

5|$|On May27, the Myanmar {{government}} {{issued a}} rare appeal for {{aid to the}} international community in response to damage from the storm. The request included $220,000 (USD) worth of rice, tarpaulin sheets for temporary shelter, medicine, and clothing, to assist 14,000people. In early June, the government issued an updated appeal to request $337,000 (USD) to help 25,000people, after the scope of the disaster became better known. The Red Cross operation responding to the cyclone ended in December 2004, which marked the first time <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> a major response to a disaster. It worked in conjunction with the World Food Programme, Bridge Asia Japan, and the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association, utilizing some private donations. Red Cross volunteers helped clear roads and clean ponds to return areas to normalcy. Typically, the government handles relief measures.|$|E
5|$|On November9, {{an area of}} disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175km (730mi) {{southeast}} of Palau. The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear. Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Late on November10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24hours. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility of the agency. At 1200UTC on November11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao, although operationally <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> classified the system two days prior.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>had</b> secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>had</b> been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E
