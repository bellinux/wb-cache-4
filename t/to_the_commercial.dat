5|$|Capcom {{announced}} a localization for the North American and European market in September 2012; at the time, {{they had planned}} a localization for about two years. Capcom USA's senior vice president, Christian Svensson, described the game's sales forecasts as high compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> performance of past Ace Attorney titles, which was necessary to get a Western release greenlit.|$|E

5|$|The {{total cost}} of {{production}} was approximately two million Reichsmarks, a rather high figure for German feature films of that era. However, between 1940 and 1943, it grossed over 6.2 million Reichsmarks thus making it a blockbuster in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> failure of Der Ewige Jude.|$|E

5|$|A comic book, Lagaan: The Story, {{along with}} two {{colouring}} books, a mask book and a cricket board game were subsequently released <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted at {{children between the ages}} of six and 14. At the book's launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 {{appeared}} in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> and print ads.|$|E
5|$|Harassment and {{censorship}} {{imposed by}} the French colonial authorities led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards more direct political action, {{in a bid to}} appeal to more radical elements in the north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} sought <b>to</b> bridge <b>the</b> {{communication and}} marketing fields by applying schema theory (Bartlett, 1932) to advertisement information processing. A theoretical framework was developed which described how television commercials are remembered. Specifically, the theory hypothesized that: (a) recall of product brand will be {{significantly higher in}} the sample of participants who are exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> emphasizing brand early on in their format, than the participants who view <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> stating <b>the</b> product's brand name {{in the latter half}} of <b>the</b> <b>commercials,</b> and (b) individuals who see the brand name formatted commercials will have significantly higher levels of commercial information recognition than <b>the</b> individuals exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> that do not state the brand name at the onset. The results of the study provided intial support for the proposed framework and suggested that brand name formatted commercials will generally enhance recall and significantly impact recognition...|$|R

5|$|In December 2008, Resident Evil was ported to the GameCube's successor, the Wii, {{along with}} Resident Evil Zero. The port, titled Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil, {{features}} a control system that supports both the Wii Remote and the GameCube controller. Although Capcom originally {{had no plans}} to release the Wii version outside Japan, arguing that the game would not sell very well, the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> success of Resident Evil 5. The Wii version received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some publications criticized it for its outdated controls, lack of new features, and lack of widescreen support.|$|E
5|$|The 1844 Railway act of England {{compelled}} {{at least}} one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile. Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes {{had the ability to}} travel to other towns frequently. Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards. The British constructed a vast railway network in India, but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> purpose. The efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|The Harajuku Lovers Tour was {{the first}} solo concert tour of American {{recording}} artist Gwen Stefani. The tour began through October to November 2005, to support of her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Although Stefani embarked on multiple tours with her band No Doubt, she initially opted {{not to participate in}} a tour to promote her album, an attitude that the singer eventually abandoned due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> success of Love.

It reached number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 40 in the United States, and was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for surpassing one million copies. The album has been reissued on CD several times, and was given a Blu-ray release in 2014 remixed by Steven Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The atrium, apartments, offices, {{and stores}} opened on a {{staggered}} schedule from February to November 1983.

5|$|The {{film was}} panned by {{mainstream}} critics, particularly {{for what they}} saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing the film as unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> success of the film, which was planned as the first part of a series, its sequel is currently in development.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} the border town of Dryden, NY38 {{emerges from the}} valley and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still undeveloped area.

It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter begins here and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E

5|$|Falling attendances due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> {{nature of}} the district, and also a sense {{that there was some}} {{redundancy}} of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in part because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but {{commenced}} a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
