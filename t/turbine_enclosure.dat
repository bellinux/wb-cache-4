40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} design and scaling characteristics of Tesla – or so-called “friction” – turbines, and offers design solutions for achieving optimum performance given the input specifications. The research covers turbines ranging from sub-watt power scavenging designs to watt-range mobile applications to kilowatt-range renewable energy applications. The characteristics of the turbine are demonstrated using micro fabrication, theoretical analysis, and ANSYS, COMSOL, and MATLAB simulations. A MATLAB GUI is provided for generating design specifications and turbine performance sensitivity. In Tesla turbines, the fluid profile {{and the length of}} the fluid path inside the rotor control the pressure drop and momentum transfer. In this research, analyses of rotor performance for incompressible flow are developed for different fluid profiles and fluid-path lengths. First, frictional losses in the nozzle and at the rotor-turbine interface are investigated, along with other turbine losses. These losses are then classified and modeled in terms of their relationship to head loss and shaft power loss, and investigated using MATLAB and COMSOL. As the turbine scales down, this scaled performance is evaluated and a constraint list for turbine hardware and operating parameters is derived. These results are used to optimize performance for the full range of millimeter to meter sized turbines. Tesla turbines at the scales covered in this dissertation (mm – m) are relatively easy to manufacture. The experimental mini-turbines presented in this research have two primary components, fabricated using commercially available technologies: 1) four 1 cm-diameter rotors with variation in number of disks, interdisk spacing, and effective area, and 2) a <b>turbine</b> <b>enclosure</b> with eight nozzles of varying area, angle, and shape. Test results from different configurations of nozzles and rotors are presented, and observations made on the performance trends of the turbine. Flow through the 1 cm rotors is also simulated in ANSYS to verify the momentum equations. The performance difference between analytical solutions, simulation, and experimental results is then studied, and a mapping of experimental results onto analytical results is proposed. In addition, various scaling-down methodologies are investigated. Disk spacing is varied as a power function of radius, and turbine performance is analyzed across the turbine range of 1 mm to 400 mm diameter. Using this approach, constant power density designs are specified that perform at better than 35 % mechanical efficiency for the entire range. As the turbine is scaled down, the roughening of the disks must be increased to control the fluid profile. Power density is very sensitive to the rotor spacing and the input head, and efficiency is very sensitive to the operating parameters and turbine design. This dissertation argues that these sensitivities explain the wide discrepancies in published turbine performances. A practical design tool is also offered, which inputs user specifications on head, flow, particulate size, and medium to generate a list of possible turbine designs along with a recommendation for four candidate designs. The sensitivities of turbine performance to the input head and input flow variations are also reported. The tool is designed to cover 20 mW to 20 kW power range and 2 mm to 500 mm rotor radius range. Current applications and potential extensions to the research are discussed in the conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} on the research and application of water mist technology in fire suppression has been substantial over the last decade. This paper, following our previous review on water mist fundamental studies, reviews recent water mist applications for the extinguishment of Class B spray and pool fires in machinery spaces, gas <b>turbine</b> <b>enclosures,</b> combat vehicles, and flammable liquid storage rooms; the extinguishment of Class A fires in residential occupancies, marine accommodations and public spaces, heritage buildings and libraries; the extinguishment of Class C fires in the electronic equipment and computer rooms; and {{for the protection of}} aircraft onboard cabin and cargo compartments. Some new applications, {{such as the use of}} water mist for the extinguishment of Class K fires in the commercial cooking areas; the use of water mist as a possible total-ship protection method, as well as the use of water mist for the protection of heavy goods vehicle shuttle trains, are also reviewed. Up-to-date development of corresponding test and design criteria for the installation of water mist fire protection systems and for the evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of water mist for fire suppression in some application areas, such as machinery spaces, ships cabins and corridors, and <b>turbine</b> <b>enclosures,</b> are discussed. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{system to}} recover {{part of the}} energy of exhaust air from an axial fan of 75 kW using a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine is {{discussed}} in this paper. The actual air data at the fan outlet are collected from central air conditioning station of a composite textile mill (Kombolcha Textile Share Company) using log-Tchebycheff method. Since the air flow type determines the steps in progress the air flow type is arithmetically found to be fully turbulent. A duct is designed to correct the air turbulence and transport the exhaust air from the fan to the <b>turbine.</b> The <b>enclosure</b> duct design is developed in consideration of the actual situation of the company to attain a fully developed region where the air speed attains a uniform velocity profile and create a venturi effect (to increase the air speed) for better energy output and guide the air before it interacts with the wind turbine blades. By turning what was exhausted to useable form 5. 7 kW of electric power can be harvested. As there are vast application areas of industrial air system, utilizing the exhaust from such air systems as energy resource could be helpful and used as supplementary power for industry production floor lighting and little power supply requiring auxiliary processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{system for}} recovering exhaust gas is created to recycle the energy from industry cooling tower waste. Two Vertical Axis Wind <b>Turbines</b> (VAWTs) with <b>enclosure</b> are positioned {{at a specific}} position at the outlet of cooling tower to harness the wind energy for electricity generation. From structural dynamics aspect, adding two VAWTs or dual-rotor with enclosure can contribute extra burden to the cooling tower. This has changed the dynamic characteristics of the cooling tower. Therefore, a hybrid non-destructive evaluation approach is proposed to investigate the dynamic behaviour and reliability of this new design. From this approach, {{it was found that}} the overall vibration of the cooling tower increased from 3 mm/s to 26 mm/s after the installation of the VAWTs with enclosure. The VAWTs are not operating at its optimum speed due to energy loss in vibration. The operating speed of VAWTs (i. e. 7. 5 Hz) was found close to one of the natural frequencies of VAWT (i. e. 7. 0 Hz). This indicates structural dynamic weakness which causes high vibration as recorded. Structural Dynamic Modification (SDM) is performed on the new design in the attempt to reduce the vibration at VAWTs and improve the reliability of VAWTs with enclosure in order to ensure optimum operation of VAWTs. The SDM is expected to shift the natural frequency away from the operating frequency with around 81 % of reduction in vibration level which leads it to safe and unrestricted long-term operation. In addition, reducing vibration at VAWTs also recovers the energy loss of 419 Joules and subsequently maximises the efficiency of wind turbine...|$|R
