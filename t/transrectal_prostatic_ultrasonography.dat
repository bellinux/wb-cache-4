40|$|Echoguided drug {{infiltration}} {{in chronic}} prostatitis: {{results of a}} multi-centre study. Objectives: In chronic prostatitis there are many causes that may provoke a thera-peutical failure of a systemic antibiotic treatment. At the moment a consensus has not been reached on {{the efficacy of the}} many therapeutical options that are available with not one of these approaches being efficacious in all patients. In our view the main cau-ses of treatment failure are the well-known hurdle to antibiotic diffusion inside the glandular parenchyma associated with the so-called intraprostatic bacterial biofilms and the possible presence of local auto-immune reactions. Given this background we tested ultrasound guided intra-prostate infiltration of a cocktail of antibiotics and betamethazone, for a thera-peutical options.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} circadian urine {{production and}} its determinants {{in a large}} population based sample of older men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on 1, 688 men 50 to 78 years old, without radical prostatectomy, prostate or bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder disease or negative advice from their general practitioner, recruited from the population of Krimpen, the Netherlands. Measurements consisted of self-administered questionnaires, including the International Prostate Symptom Score, a 3 -day frequency-volume chart, <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> ultrasound, uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume. Hourly urine production was determined and urine production day-to-night ratio was calculated from the frequency-volume chart. RESULTS: Men younger than 65 years showed a clear circadian urine production pattern, whereas in older men this pattern was less clear. Smoking, use of diuretic drugs, post-void residual and 24 -hour polyuria reinforced the circadian pattern, in favor of daytime urine production.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Transrectal {{ultrasound}} biopsy {{of prostate}} is a painful procedure. The {{introduction of the}} rectal probe {{is one of the}} major contributors to the pain associated with this procedure. Drugs that relax the anal sphincter should theoretically decrease this pain. This study was done to compare the efficacy and safety of two topical medications that relax the anal sphincter, diltiazem and nitroglycerine, in decreasing the pain associated with transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 66 patients who were to undergo their first prostate biopsy were randomized to receive either 2 mL of 2 % topical diltiazem or 2 mL of 0. 2 % topical nitroglycerine or placebo 20 minutes before prostate biopsy. All patients also received 15 mL of intrarectal lignocaine. A 10 -point visual analogue score was used to record the pain immediately after the insertion of the probe, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: The pain scores due to probe insertion, during biopsy and at the end of the procedure in patients who received topical diltiazem or nitroglycerine were significantly lower compared to the placebo group (p < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in the pain scores between the patients receiving diltiazem compared to those receiving nitroglycerine. Higher incidence of headache and fall in blood pressure was noted in patients who received nitroglycerine compared to those receiving diltiazem. CONCLUSION:Topical diltiazem and nitroglycerine are equally effective in reducing the pain associated with <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> biopsy.

40|$|Objective: To search which {{category}} of proteins {{can be detected}} in urine {{in order to examine}} subsequently its ability to improve our accuracy for the diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PCa) as biomarkers in clinical useful fluids like urine and serum. Material and method(s) : Urine samples of 127 patients were obtained after a vigorous <b>transrectal</b> <b>prostatic</b> massage to both lobes. The patients were considered to have a high risk for PCa according to their PSA (> 4 ng/ml), their digital rectal examination (DRE) (positive for suspicious prostatic lesions) or to their abnormal PSA kinetics (PSA velocity (PSAV > 0. 75 ng/mL). All patients subsequently were subjected to an extended 10 -core per prostatic lobe TRUS-b (total 20 prostatic samples). The proteins that were chosen to be detected in the urine samples with Western-blot, as possible biomarkers, were Glutathione peroxidase 3 precursor (GPx 3), Cofilin- 1 (CFL 1), Heat shock protein- 90 β (HSP 90 β), Zinc alpha 2 -glycoprotein (ZAG) and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). These proteins have been detected previously in the prostatic tissue by proteomics proving their discriminative ability between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

40|$|Purpose: To make an {{objective}} controlled comparison of pain tolerance in <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostatic</b> biopsy using intrarectal topic anesthesia, injectable periprostatic anesthesia, or low-dose intravenous sedation. Materials and Methods: One {{hundred and sixty}} patients were randomized into 4 groups: group I, intrarectal application of 2 % lidocaine gel; group II, periprostatic anesthesia; group III, intravenous injection of midazolam and meperidine; and group IV, control, patients to whom no sedation or analgesic was given. Pain was evaluated using an analogue pain scale graded from 0 to 5. Acceptance of a repetition biopsy, {{the side effects of}} the drugs and complications were also evaluated. Results: 18 / 20 (90 %) and 6 / 20 (30 %) patients reported strong or unbearable pain in the group submitted to conventional biopsy and topical anesthesia (p = 0. 23, chi-square = 1. 41); whereas those submitted to periprostatic blockade and sedation, severe pain occurred in only 2 / 60 (3 %) patients (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 40. 19) and 3 / 60 (5 %) patients (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 33. 34). Acceptance of repetition of the biopsy was present in only 45 % of the patients submitted to conventional biopsy, 60 % of those that were given topical anesthesia (p = 0. 52, chi-square = 0. 4), compared to 100 % of those submitted to periprostatic anesthesia (p < 0. 01, chi-square = 15. 17), and 95 % of those who were sedated (p < 0. 001, chi-square = 25. 97 %).

Research work has been on-going to assess if there are other better tests suitable for primary or secondary screening of PCa to supplement the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which fails to work accurately in a grey zone of 4 - 10 ng/ml. In this pilot study, the potential roles of urinary polyamines as prostate cancer biomarkers were evaluated. PCa, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls (HC) showing PSA> 4. 0 ng/ml {{were enrolled in the}} study. Their urine samples were obtained, and the urinary levels of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS).

It gives an accurate diagnostic picture in {{a high percentage of}} cases and is extremely useful for following patients during therapy and after surgery. The forms of acute andrological disorders, of both medical and surgical pertinence, that can be evaluated ultrasonographically include many prostate, seminal vesicle and external genital afflictions. Among the prostate and seminal vesicle disorders, of particular importance are acute prostate vesiculitis and <b>prostatic</b> abscess. <b>Ultrasonography</b> can be used to advantage in the latter as a guide to percutaneous transperineal drainage.

A further factor is that the ScanTrainer’s haptic device can be tailored to three force feedback levels: normal resistance (most realistic), reduced and minimal (lowest) designed to avoid overheating during heavy use, {{and it is likely}} that a lower force feedback setting might have contributed to the lower scores.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} prostate cancer (PCa) on a third prostate biopsy {{in a group of}} patients with two consecutive diagnoses of high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Materials and methods: From November 2004 to December 2007, patients referred to our clinic with a PSA ! 4 ng/ml or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were scheduled for trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided 12 -core prostate biopsy. Patients with HGPIN underwent a second prostate biopsy, and if the results of such procedure yielded a second diagnosis of HGPIN, we proposed a third 12 -core needle biopsy regardless of PSA value. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were used to assess predictors of PCa on the third biopsy. Results: A total of 650 patients underwent 12 cores <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound <b>prostatic</b> biopsy in the study period. Of 147 (22 %) men with a diagnosis of HGPIN, 117 underwent a second prostatic biopsy after six months and 43 a third biopsy after other six months. After the third biopsy, 19 patients (34 %) still showed HGPIN, 15 (35 %) were diagnosed with PCa and 9 (21 %) presented with chronic prostatitis. Widespread HGPIN on a second biopsy was significantly associated with PCa on further biopsy (! 2 = 4. 04, p = 0. 04). Moreover, the presence of widespread HGPIN significantly predicted the risk of PCa on crude and adjusted logistic regressions. Conclusions: Widespread HGPIN on second biopsy is associated with the presence of PCa on a third biopsy. Nonetheless, the relationship between HGPIN and PCa remains complex and further studies are needed to confirm our findings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Prostatic cysts are uncommon. These cysts {{are usually}} {{asymptomatic}} and are diagnosed incidentally during ultrasonographic examination.

40|$|Purpose: Male overactive bladder (OAB) may {{be caused}} by prostatic pathologies such as bladder outlet {{obstruction}} (BOO). Intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) has been found to correlate with BOO and acute urinary retention. We investigated the interrelation between male OAB symptoms and IPP for estimating anatomical changes to the prostate. Materials and Methods: We assessed 179 consecutive men aged> 40 years who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms. The initial evaluation included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life assessments, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. The degree of IPP was determined by the distance from the tip of the protrusion to the circumference of the bladder {{at the base of the}} prostate gland. Patients with IPP < 0. 5 cm were defined as group A (n= 114), and patients having 0. 5 cm≤IPP< 1 cm were defined as group B (n= 38). The others were defined as group C (n= 27). Results: A total of 51 patients complained of urgency in group A, 38 patients in group B, and 27 patients in group C. Likewise, 14 patients had a history of acute urinary retention in group A, 8 patients in group B, and 16 patients in group C. IPP grade had a statistically significant relation with both OAB and a history of acute urinary retention. Conclusions: The results of our study have shown that male OAB is correlated with IPP. However, larger scale studies are needed to confirm these results.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the current performance of urological residents regarding basic urological procedures {{in relation to}} patient safety issues and the identification of specific training needs. Design: Observational data of 146 urethrocystoscopies (UCSs), 27 transrectal ultrasounds of the prostate (TRUSs), 38 <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound-guided <b>prostatic</b> biopsies (TRUSPs), and 30 transurethral resections of bladder tumor (TURBTs) were collected. Performance was evaluated using scoring lists including details on completeness of procedural steps, level of independence, time, and the incidence of unintended events. The causal factors contributing to the unintended events were identified by 2 expert urologists and classified according to the recognized PRISMA method. Setting: This study was performed in 5 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants: We included 11 junior residents and 5 senior residents in urology in the final study cohort. Results: Senior residents showed a lower degree of completeness in material usage than junior residents did during UCS (p < 0. 01) and in preparation, material usage, and procedure during TRUSP (all p < 0. 05). In UCS and TURBT, senior residents received significantly less feedback than junior residents did (both p < 0. 01). Incidence of unintended events for junior vs senior residents was 11 % and 4 % in UCS, 0 % and 7 % in transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, 36 % and 62 % in TRUSP, and 41 % and 23 % in TURBT, respectively. Overall, unintended events were mainly caused by human factors, in particular, verification and skills-based issues. Conclusion: Present performance of basic urological procedures involves {{a high percentage of}} unintended events, especially in TRUSP and TURBT, which are mainly caused by human factors and are a potential threat for patient safety. Junior residents are less independent but more thorough in the performance of UCS and TRUSP than senior residents are. Targeted skills training including assessment should be implemented before privileges for independent practice are granted to reduce the incidence of unintended events and optimize patient safety.

40|$|Policlinico Tor Vergata, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} the number of biopsy cores revealing high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer in an era of extended biopsy protocol. Materials and Methods: From December 2004 to September 2007 patients referred to our clinic with a prostate specific antigen of 4 ng/ml or greater or an abnormal digital rectal examination were scheduled for <b>transrectal</b> ultrasound <b>prostatic</b> biopsy with a 12 -core template. In patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia we proposed a second prostate specific antigen evaluation and a new 12 -core biopsy after 6 months independent of prostate specific antigen. Nonparametric tests were applied for statistical analysis. Results: We evaluated 650 patients. Of the 147 patients (22 %) with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 117 underwent a second biopsy 6 months later. Patient characteristics (age, prostate specific antigen, free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen density) were similar at initial and repeat biopsy. On second biopsy 22 patients (18. 8 %) presented with prostate cancer (14 with Gleason score 6, 7 with Gleason score 7 and 1 with a Gleason score 8), 75 showed isolated high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (64. 2 %) and 20 (17 %) had chronic prostatitis. The number of cores (4 or more) involved with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on the first biopsy was significantly associated with prostate cancer on the second biopsy (p 0. 001). Prostate specific antigen could not be used to distinguish prostate cancer from benign disease or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Conclusions: The number of cores with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia seems {{to be associated with the}} presence of cancer on second biopsy. A 6 -month biopsy is recommended in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia when 4 or more cores with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia are detected in the initial biopsy sample independent of prostate specific antigen...|$|R

40|$|We herein {{report an}} 80 -year-old man with prostatic {{carcinoma}} who developed eosinophilic pneumonia and intrathoracic metastases. He presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever as a chief complaint. Chest X-ray and computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and right-sided consolidation. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed poor uptake in these nodules and lymph nodes. The patient subsequently received a pelvic computed to-mography scan, which revealed a massively enlarged prostate. The serum prostate specific antigen level was elevated to 4, 181. 2 ng/mL, and a <b>transrectal</b> biopsy revealed <b>prostatic</b> adenocarcinoma. Based on the morpho-logical and immunohistochemical findings, the nodules in the lung and {{the lymph nodes}} were diagnosed as secondary neoplasm from the prostate. As for right-sided consolidation, remarkable bronchoalvelar lavage fluid eosinophilia was detected, that was compatible with eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophilic pneumonia in this case disappeared and has not recurred by treatment of prostatic carcinoma and steroid therapy for a week, and was regarded to be tumor-associated. Although prostatic carcinoma with an initial manifestation of intrathoracic metastases and eosinophilic pneumonia is uncommon, physicians should suspect the condition. In addition, we should also {{keep in mind that}} prostatic carcinoma sometimes shows poor uptake in FDG-PET...|$|R
