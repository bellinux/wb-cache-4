50|$|The Directors Guild of America Award for Feature Film has {{traditionally}} been a near perfect barometer for the Academy Award for Best Director.

This does not count 1948-49, when the DGA used a non-calendar award year (unlike the Academy Awards); both 1948 and 1949 DGA winners competed for the 1949 Academy Award for Best Director, which went to the 1948 DGA winner (Joseph L.
