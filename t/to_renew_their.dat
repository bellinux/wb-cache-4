Instead of simply renewing the agreement, Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee.|$|E

60|$|At {{that time}} {{one of the chief}} {{rendezvous}} of the pirates was the little island of San José, one of the southernmost of the Bahama group.

For example, California licensees must complete 45 hours of continuing education every 4 years in topics such as agency, trust fund handling, consumer protection, fair housing, ethics, and risk management. Many states recognize licenses from other states and issue licenses to existing agents and firms upon request without additional education or testing however the license must be granted before real estate service is provided in the state.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, {{two sons}} of Rædwald's brother Eni, who were both eager <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> Christian alliances, made {{diplomatic}} marriages during this period: Anna, {{who was to}} become a devout Christian ruler, married a woman of East Saxon connection and his brother Æthelric married a Northumbrian princess, Hereswitha, who was Edwin of Northumbria's grand-niece. This marriage was probably intended to reinforce the conversion of East Anglia to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day {{was spent in}} launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of cover. On 23 November, 2-503 and 4-503 were ordered <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> assault while the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south. This time the Americans gained the crest, but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions, leaving only a few dozen charred bodies and weapons.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E

With a view <b>to</b> <b>renewing</b> <b>their</b> collective destiny in a post-Cold War Asian geopolitical canvas that once again bears both the flux and promise reminiscent of the early post-independence period, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono paid a three-day visit to India in late January 2011. Sourabh Gupta argues that, despite past missteps and future hurdles, India and Indonesia's parallel histories, similar policy preferences, and opportune international circumstances are drawing both countries closer to revitalize bilateral relations and potentially reconfigure Asian geopolitics...|$|R

5|$|The centres were {{originally}} leased to {{and operated by}} several major gasoline distributors; however, those companies have chosen not <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> leases as the terms end.

5|$|The success {{led to a}} {{much more}} ambitious {{offensive}} operation named Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star) {{less than two weeks}} later. That operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, lifting the siege altogether, but it achieved only minimal progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> offensive and completely lift the siege, but made only modest gains in each one. The corridor remained in range of German artillery and the siege was only over on January 27, 1944.|$|E

5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil war going on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> titles for the new Ming court.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{between the}} Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction {{was brought to}} an {{official}} on-screen conclusion.

When he learned that it was fake, he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> wedding vows. Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward, but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H. The divorce, and thus the storyline, was finalized at Vengeance.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge this ruling in court. WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company.

5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended <b>to</b> <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} abuses of media rights and access. The Zimbabwean {{government}} {{is accused of}} suppressing {{freedom of the press}} and freedom of speech.

BBC News, Sky News, and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe. In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted.
