25|$|The ladies wear {{jackets and}} {{petticoats}} of brown linen, with chip hats, {{in which they}} fix their handkerchiefs to wipe <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or {{the heat of the}} water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.|$|E
25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When she paused to wipe <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> Jesus's face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
2500|$|... the Nazi entourage in Raiders of the Lost Ark, upon {{arriving}} at their island base, begin an elaborate {{trek to the}} centre of the island, with soldiers holding aloft National Socialist standards. The procession is somewhat ostentatious given the climate, prompting the black-dressed Gestapo agent to remove his hat and wipe <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his brow.|$|E
6000|$|But Stephen, looking {{quite old}} from {{exhaustion}} and with <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> streaming <b>from</b> {{him as he}} laboured at his unaccustomed paddle, gasped: ...|$|R
50|$|The term 'compensatory' {{is largely}} misleading, as it {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} compensatory mechanism that takes effect after sympathectomy, in which the body 'redirects' <b>the</b> <b>sweating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> palms or face to other areas of <b>the</b> body. <b>Sweating</b> after sympathetic surgery is a reflex cycle between the sympathetic system and the anterior portion of <b>the</b> hypothalamus. Reflex <b>sweating</b> will not happen if hand sweating can be stopped without interrupting sympathetic tone to the human brain.|$|R
60|$|Trent stood upright, wiped <b>the</b> dank <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his {{forehead}} and gazed around him fiercely, and upwards at that lurid little patch of blue sky.|$|R
60|$|Saunders wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{his brow}} on his {{buckskin}} sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Petru wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{his brow}} with his gauntlet, {{and with a}} desperate effort rose to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Hinchcliffe wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{his brow}} and drew breath. It {{was the first}} vehicle that he had passed, and I sympathised with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh! couldn't see us for smoke," [...] Hootchinoo Bill chuckled, flirting <b>the</b> {{stinging}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{his brow}} and glancing swiftly {{back along the}} way they had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a rum 'un, you are," [...] {{he added}} reflectively, {{as he watched}} <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> pouring <b>from</b> off Kent's face and the quavering of his knees.|$|R
6000|$|There is silence. He {{takes out}} his {{handkerchief}} and mops <b>the</b> [...] <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his face. Going back blindly to his table, sits [...] down, and stares blankly at his lunch.|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'm gettin' plumb dried out," [...] Billy announced, mopping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his sunburned forehead. [...] "What d'ye say we {{head for}} the coast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then wipe <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{brow and}} cheek. It runnels forth afresh, my lord. 'Uphold me--for the flesh is weak.' You've {{finished}} with the Flesh, my lord.|$|E
60|$|He threw {{aside the}} great armful of yellow flowers, {{took off his}} cap, and wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his brow. The sickle dangled loose in his hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{answer was}} a long time coming; at last the man nodded an assent, <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> pouring <b>from</b> his purple face. She had set him thinking; her victory was sure.|$|R
40|$|Sweat {{production}} {{is determined by}} <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> output <b>from</b> each gland {{and the number of}} active sweat glands. When we measure sweat rate (whole-body or local) we are measuring <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> rate <b>from</b> a large number of <b>sweat</b> glands within <b>the</b> defined surface area. An estimation of the number of heat-activated sweat glands, in conjunction with measurements of local sweat rate, can be used to determine average sweat gland output. Quantifying the number of heat-activated sweat glands can be used, for example, to compare sweat gland function between populations or to characterize the extent of neuropathy...|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} work, and <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> {{his face and}} down his chin. But he kept at it, noting at each turn how close the steeds and the elegant turnout were drawing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us be going," [...] said Martha. [...] "There {{is no time}} to lose." [...] So they {{straightened}} {{their backs}} and wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> their brows.|$|E
60|$|Mulhall wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his eyes. All were {{sweating}} profusely {{and breathing}} hard. There was no {{ice in the}} drink that was served, and whiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is papa," [...] said Jane, as {{they got}} to the gate. Then they waited for a few minutes till Mr. Crawley came up, very hot, wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Paul saw {{drops of}} <b>sweat</b> fall <b>from</b> his father's brow. Six {{men were in}} the room--six coatless men, with yielding, {{struggling}} limbs, filling the room and knocking against the furniture. The coffin veered, and was gently lowered on to <b>the</b> chairs. <b>The</b> <b>sweat</b> fell <b>from</b> Morel's face on its boards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I serve {{under the}} {{standard}} of his gracious Majesty, George III," [...] returned the priest, wiping <b>the</b> cold <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his brow. [...] "But really {{the idea of being}} scalped has a strong tendency to unman a new-beginner, like myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew!" [...] I ejaculated, as I stood wiping <b>the</b> honest <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> my {{face with}} my moldy, ancient, and {{extremely}} dirty pocket-handkerchief. [...] "Three hundred and sixty-four days {{of this sort of}} thing is a rather long price to pay for a suit of clothes." ...|$|R
60|$|They have rested {{the coffin}} {{on the gate}} posts, and the bearers are wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> their faces. They put their hands to their {{shoulders}} on {{the place where the}} weight has pressed.|$|E
60|$|Kells purled out a {{suspended}} breath and he flung <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his brow. There was about him, {{perhaps more than}} the others, a dark realization of how close the call had been for Pearce.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I think I'll take one," [...] said Wallenstein, wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his face. His eye {{caught the}} shadow of Koho {{on the floor and}} {{followed}} it up to the old chief himself. [...] "Hello! who's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|They sat up, {{but were}} too {{exhausted}} to rise. Big Olaf, <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> pouring <b>from</b> him, breathing with tremendous, painful gasps, pawed the air and vainly tried to speak. Then he reached out his hand with unmistakable meaning; Smoke extended his, and they shook.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'd {{be worth}} {{a lot to the}} feller who can show me {{a way out of this}} mess," [...] said Buell, mopping <b>the</b> beads of <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his face.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> odour <b>from</b> <b>sweat</b> {{is due to}} {{bacterial}} {{activity on}} the secretions of <b>the</b> apocrine <b>sweat</b> glands, a distinctly different type of sweat gland found in human skin.|$|R
6000|$|... "All ready?" [...] {{the captain}} asked the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste, whose head and {{shoulders}} protruded from the small hatch just for'ard of the cabin, and who wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{his face with a}} bunch of greasy waste.|$|E
60|$|But Smoke's {{reply was}} a bantering laugh. He held {{on down the}} little valley, {{occasionally}} wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his forehead, the while his feet crushed through ripe mountain raspberries and delicate ferns that grew beside patches of sun-sheltered ice.|$|E
60|$|Casey {{leaned on}} his spade while he wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his brow and {{regarded}} his ally McDermott. Between them yawned a grave {{they had been}} digging and near at hand lay a long, quiet form wrapped in old canvas.|$|E
6000|$|Saduko ceased speaking, {{not that}} his tale was done, but because his voice choked in his throat. Indeed, seldom have I seen {{a man so}} moved. He breathed in great gasps, <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> him, and his muscles worked convulsively. I gave him a pannikin of water and he drank, then he went on: ...|$|R
60|$|The quick tropic {{twilight}} swiftly blent day and darkness. Overhead {{all stars}} were out. No faintest {{breath of air}} moved over the water, and the humid heat beaded the faces and bodies of both men with profuse sweat. They ate their deck-spread supper languidly and ever and anon used their forearms to wipe <b>the</b> stinging <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> cold <b>sweat</b> melted <b>from</b> their limbs, [...] Nor rot nor reek did they: [...] The {{look with}} which they looked on me [...] Had never passed away.|$|R
