This situation, together with the increasing cost of the retirement plans and the delay in its payments, were the causes of the financial and institutional crisis of 1998, which ended in the closure of the university in the second semester of 1998 and the suspension of payment to all the academic and administrative staff members.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline the concept of <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and to give a broad {{discussion}} of policy approaches to these infrastructures. I first outline some general features of generic technology or knowledge; the area that has been the prime focus of market failure arguments for innovation policies over the last decades. Related to the concept of generic knowledge is the concept of <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> These infrastructures have traditionally been described in terms of structures of national institutions providing generic knowledge in the form of RTO services. Reviewing the literature we argue that the concept may be developed to a more fruitful concept of <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that are more closely related to the nature of the economic resources or services provided by the infrastructure. This approach unties the strong definitional links between the traditionalised concept and the institutions providing these services. This has the rather immediate consequence of allowing a more nuanced approach to those innovation policies that address the establishment and maintenance of <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> This allows the policy formulation process to address the economic resources more directly, but at the same time this disentangling puts more exacting demands on the capabilities of the policy maker. I give a preliminary overview of main trends of innovation policies in the post-war period. This overview indicates how policy approaches to <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> have changed during this period, and how in particular how there has been a drift of policy thinking from institutionally based policies over the main parts of the post-war period, with supplementing functional approaches becoming evident over the last two decades. The functional, or resource based, approach to <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> allows us to describe ongoing structural changes of these infrastructures. Through an outline of some main aspects of these structural changes, with increasing market based supply of innovation related services, and its immediate policy implications we suggest that TIP policies must fully embrace a functional approach to accommodate the impact of these changes. ...|$|R

While the campaign had only one major battle, at Newtown (since the tribes evacuated ahead of the large military force) along the Chemung River in western New York, {{the expedition}} severely damaged the Iroquois nations' economies by burning their crops, villages, and chattels, thus ruining the Iroquois <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> With the Amerindians' shelter gone and food supplies destroyed, thereafter the strength of the Iroquois Confederacy was broken.

25|$|The 1956 Suez Crisis {{suggested}} that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue {{its foreign policy}} objectives {{on an equal footing}} with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.|$|E

40|$|Could {{crowdsourcing}} {{be a way}} to get undone science done? Could grassroots groups enlist {{volunteers to}} help make sense of large amounts of otherwise unanalyzed data—an approach that has been gaining popularity among natural scientists? This paper assesses the viability of this technique for creating new knowledge about the local effects of petrochemicals, by examining three recent experiments in crowdsourcing led by non-profits and grassroots groups. These case studies suggest that undertaking a crowdsourcing project requires significant resources, including <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that smaller or more informal groups may find it difficult to provide. They also indicate that crowdsourcing will be most successful when the questions of grassroots groups line up fairly well with existing scientific frameworks. The paper concludes that further experimentation in crowdsourcing is warranted, at least in cases where adequate resources and interpretive frameworks are available, and that further investment in <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for data analysis is needed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{dimensions}} shaping the dynamics of technology. We present a model where the knowledge stock of a country grows over time {{as a function of}} three main factors: its innovation intensity, its <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and its human capital. The latter two variables contribute to determine the absorptive capacity of a country as well as its innovative ability. Based on this theoretical framework, we carry out an empirical analysis that investigates the dynamics of technology in a large sample of developed and developing economies in the last two-decade period, and studies its relationships with the growth of income per capita in a dynamic panel model setting. The results indicate that the cross-country distributions of <b>technological</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and human capital have experienced a process of convergence, whereas the innovative intensity is characterized by increasing polarization between rich and poor economies. Thus, while the conditions for catching up have generally improved, the increasing innovation gap represents a major factor behind the observed differences in income per capita. ...|$|R
