The {{normally}} sesquiplane I-4s had {{the bottom}} wings removed (with no ill effect on flight characteristics) due <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> problems with TB-1 propellers. First flight 3 December 1931. The TB-1 was piloted by A. I. Zalevskiy and A. R. Sharapov, the I-4s were piloted by V. P. Chkalov and A. F. Anisimov. Vakhmistrov himself flew in the front gunner's turret.|$|E

40|$|Homicide {{clearance}} {{rates in}} the United States have been steadily declining from the 1960 s through the 1990 s. Our study asks: (1) Are the factors commonly identified in homicide clearance research as being related <b>to</b> <b>clearances</b> consistent across time? (2) Can these factors {{shed light on the}} decline in homicide clearance rates during the past three decades? (3) How are community area characteristics related <b>to</b> <b>clearances</b> across time? Using Chicago data from 1966 to 1995, we find that the factors vary across time and space in terms of statistical significance and magnitude of their rela-tionships. Specifically, the increasing significance of victim’s race and firearm usage may account for some of the decrease in homicide clearance rates. Community area characteristics enhance our understanding of homicide <b>clearances,</b> although <b>to</b> a lesser extent than the victim and situational characteristics of a homicide case...|$|R
25|$|The risk to sappers is {{far greater}} because they may {{be called upon to}} perform {{clearance}} as tactics dictate, including in all-weather conditions and on schedule. Command may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that mine clearance will be imperfect and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably <b>to</b> <b>clearance,</b> have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless old stock was used). In this they are often aided by technical intelligence on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} vanga are common {{such as the}} chabert vanga which can survive in {{secondary}} woodland and plantations of introduced trees. Several other species are threatened by loss of their forest habitat. Pollen's vanga is classed as near-threatened by BirdLife International and the red-shouldered vanga, Bernier's vanga, helmet vanga and red-tailed newtonia are regarded as vulnerable. Van Dam's vanga is classed as endangered because it is restricted to a small area of north-west Madagascar where the forest is rapidly disappearing due <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> for agriculture and uncontrolled bushfires. Bluntschli's vanga is known only from two old specimens and is classed as data deficient.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is inactivated by {{proteins}} such as α2-macroglobulin and α2-antiplasmin. The {{mechanism of}} plasmin inactivation involves the cleavage of an α2-macroglobulin at the bait region (a {{segment of the}} aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage) by plasmin. This initiates a conformational change such that the α2-macroglobulin collapses about the plasmin. In the resulting α2-macroglobulin-plasmin complex, the active site of plasmin is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing the plasmin's access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur {{as a consequence of}} bait region cleavage, namely (i) a h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester of the α2-macroglobulin becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain. The exposure of this receptor binding domain allows the α2-macroglobulin protease complex to bind <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> receptors and be removed from circulation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} dimensional synthesis of linkages with multiple joint <b>clearances</b> <b>to</b> generate a desired coupler curve. Link lengths are determined with an objective of minimizing error between desired curve and generated curve. Clearance is treated as a mass-less link.

Variation of values of error with the variation of clearance parameters is also studied in the work...|$|R
25|$|On Flight Day 4, Stott and Barratt grappled the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) {{using the}} Canadarm2 and removed {{it from the}} {{starboard}} sill of Discovery's payload bay. Once it was grappled {{and out of the}} payload bay, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System grappled the end of the OBSS and took a hand off from the Canadarm2. The OBSS was grappled by the space station arm, because the SRMS could not reach it due <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> issues, and it needed to be moved out of the way so that the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) could be removed from the payload bay. After the OBSS hand off, the entire STS-133 crew was joined by ISS Expedition 26 commander Scott Kelly and flight engineer Paolo Nespoli for a series of in-flight media interviews. The interviews were conducted with the Weather Channel, WBZ radio in Boston, Massachusetts, WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, and WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. The crew also completed more cargo transfers to and from the ISS. Throughout the day, Drew and Bowen prepared tools that they would use on their spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Later in the day, they were joined by the shuttle crew and ISS commander Kelly and Flight Engineer Nespoli, for a review of the spacewalk procedures. After the review, Bowen and Drew donned oxygen masks and entered the crew lock of the Quest airlock for the standard pre-spacewalk campout. The airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi for the night. This was done to help the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from their blood and help prevent decompression sickness, also known as the bends.|$|E

2500|$|The pathway {{by which}} hepatic viruses cause viral {{hepatitis}} is best {{understood in the}} case of hepatitis B and C. The viruses do not directly cause apoptosis (cell death). [...] Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death. [...] Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body's defense, infection can either lead <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus. [...] The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that overtime lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma. [...] Individuals with an impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection. Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. [...] Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response. In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired.|$|E

However, since the cast change from Amanda Tapping (Samantha Carter) to Robert Picardo (Richard Woolsey) {{from the beginning of the}} season, the idea for [...] "The Replacement" [...] was dropped, and Wright went with [...] "The Shrine". The working title of the episode was [...] "The Shrine of Talus", but was changed to [...] "The Shrine", due <b>to</b> <b>clearance</b> issues with releasing the title. The final draft of the script was completed around 10 March 2008. Filming for the episode took place on the week starting on 22 April. The episode's writer, Brad Wright was somewhat inspired by the Daniel Keyes novel, Flowers for Algernon for the plot of the episode.|$|E
