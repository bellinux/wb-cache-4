The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the garbage to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails to make it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> in time. As the garbage men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on their front lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E

Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E

In relation to this, market abuse activities such as front running and quote stuffing, dark pools and flash orders, hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud, high frequency trading, credit default swaps and short selling will be briefly analysed. This is done <b>to</b> investigate whether <b>the</b> current South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework is robust enough to effectively combat these activities. This is further aimed at exposing certain challenges embedded in the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prevention and combating of the aforementioned practices {{in the financial markets}} in South Africa. <b>To</b> this end, <b>the</b> article seeks <b>to</b> explore these challenges by, first, examining the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> combating of front running and quote stuffing. Secondly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curbing</b> of dark pools and flash orders will be discussed. Thirdly, the adequacy of the aforesaid enforcement framework will be examined in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> combating of hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud. Fourthly, a similar examination will be done in respect of high frequency trading. Fifthly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curbing</b> of credit default swaps will be discussed.
