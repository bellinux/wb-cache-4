The next year, they solved the problem by buying a cot and a stove. The papads were kept on <b>the</b> <b>cot</b> and the stove below <b>the</b> <b>cot</b> so that the process of drying could take place in spite of the rains.|$|E
25|$|The Car of Tomorrow {{was first}} raced at the 2007 Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, the season's fifth race. The tracks that saw <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> twice in 2007 besides Bristol and Martinsville International Speedway were Phoenix International Raceway, Richmond International Raceway, Dover International Speedway, and New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Other than Talladega (for the fall event), Darlington Raceway {{and the road}} course races at Infineon Raceway (Sonoma, Calif.) and Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International ran <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> once each in 2007.|$|E
25|$|On March 25, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> {{debuted in}} its first NASCAR-sanctioned race. Kyle Busch won the race, the first win for the Chevrolet Impala since Wendell Scott's {{historic}} race in 1963.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{elimination}} of <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> in 2013, NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France identified the model as his biggest failure {{as the head of}} the sport due to the lack of manufacturer identity.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{transport}} is handled by separate equipment. In an Integrated DLC, <b>the</b> <b>COT</b> is eliminated. Instead, the RT is connected digitally to {{equipment in the}} telephone switch. This reduces {{the total amount of}} equipment required.|$|E
25|$|Drivers tested <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> {{concurrently}} {{with the}} old car at some NASCAR tests and at special NASCAR-authorized sessions. Other testing sessions occurred at the half-mile Greenville-Pickens Speedway, Caraway Speedway in Asheboro, NC, and the one-mile North Carolina Speedway (now Rockingham Speedway), none of which were Sprint Cup tracks at the time (North Carolina Speedway was a regular venue until 2005), and therefore did not fall under NASCAR's restrictions.|$|E

25|$|The Nationwide Series (now Xfinity Series) debuted its {{own version}} of <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> in July 2010 at Daytona International Speedway, running four races that season before fully {{implementing}} the car in 2011. The Xfinity car uses the same chassis as the Sprint Cup Series, but features an extended wheelbase of 110inches (2794 millimeters). The second-tier series also utilizes different body style, primarily marketing American pony cars such as the Ford Mustang.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{replaced the}} carburetor as the fuel distributor in the Car of the Tomorrow starting in 2012. For 2013, NASCAR allowed manufacturers {{to design a}} brand-new body style for <b>the</b> <b>COT</b> chassis that will resemble a given production car even more. The changes were largely cosmetic, with hopes of returning mechanical grip to drivers. At the 2012 Ford Championship Weekend {{the body of the}} car made it the Gen 6 car by NASCAR. During the 2012 season, it was announced that Ford would use the Mk.V Ford Mondeo, known as the Fusion in the Americas, Toyota would continue to use the 2013 Camry, while the Holden VF Commodore, rebadged in North America as the Chevrolet Super Sport (SS), replaced the Chevrolet Impala and Dodge announced they would use the Charger. However, soon after, Dodge announced their withdrawal from the sport, after being unable to convince other teams to switch to Dodge to replace Penske Racing (which returned to Ford).|$|E
25|$|Original {{implementation}} plans called for <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> {{to be used}} at 26 events in 2008, starting with both races at Daytona, including the season-opening Daytona 500 and related events (Budweiser Shootout and Gatorade Duels), the spring race at Talladega and Michigan, both races at California Speedway, Pocono Raceway and the event at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Based {{on the success of}} the February 28 test at Bristol, NASCAR considered requiring CoT cars for the full schedule in 2008 in order to avoid applying two sets of rules (as supported by a survey of NASCAR owners, with 80% favoring the switch), adding all three events (including the all-star event) at Lowe's Motor Speedway, as well as both races at Atlanta and Texas Motor Speedway, and single races at Chicagoland Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway one year earlier than scheduled. This was confirmed on Tuesday, May 22, 2007, by NASCAR. Had NASCAR continued with the original schedule of implication, the other tracks would have been added in 2009.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} lap of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, leader Carl Edwards swerved {{into the path}} of Brad Keselowski in order to prevent Keselowski from passing; Keselowski turned Edwards into the air and Edwards's car bounced off of the hood of Ryan Newman's car and flipped into the catch fence, then came to a rest {{in the middle of the}} track further down. Edwards was uninjured, but the crash was {{compared}} to an accident at Talladega in 1987 where Bobby Allison went airborne and hit the catch fence in a similar location. Allison's crash (coming at speeds 20 MPH faster than Edwards' crash) ripped out a 100-foot section of the catch fence, while Edwards' crash only bent the support poles. Seven spectators were injured in Edwards' accident from debris. The aftermath of the accident spawned questions about the aerodynamic features of <b>the</b> <b>CoT,</b> the nature of pack racing with restrictor plates, and the safety features of Talladega Superspeedway. Video replay showed that despite deploying, the car's roof flaps did nothing to stop the car from flipping– a common failing of the devices dating to their very first month in use– and the second hit from Newman flipped the car higher.|$|E

When alone, Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the séance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the [...] "boy", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, but no one is watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse-like child (Wall) begins to rise from <b>the</b> <b>cot</b> used for Madam Talbot's doll.

2500|$|Criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because I could have told you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how <b>the</b> <b>CoT</b> was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
