5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E

5|$|For Season 17, John Lloyd, a {{frequent}} collaborator with script editor Douglas Adams, adapted material from his unpublished science fiction story GiGax and in October 1978 submitted Shylock, a four-part serial written in Adams' light-hearted style. After providing a second {{draft of the}} storyline to modify parts of the script to avoid {{issues such as the}} rules involving child actors, Lloyd was forced to focus on his commitments as producer of Not the Nine O'Clock News. Williams was still interested enough in the storyline that he made plans to involved writer Allan Prior to work on the scripts. The storyline was commissioned on 7 February 1979 and a script list dated 29 June 1979 links Lloyd and Prior to the project. Lloyd officially agreed to another writer taking on his story on 25 August 1979. In the story, the Doctor is subpoenaed <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> when a corporation tries to buy Earth in order to obtain a matter-transmutation device.|$|E
5|$|The {{secret was}} not kept for long, and Gordon-Cumming demanded a {{retraction}} from the Wilson family, whom he considered {{to blame for}} divulging the news. They refused, and he filed a writ for slander in February 1891. Despite {{the efforts of the}} prince's courtiers to have the matter dealt with by a military court, the case was heard in June 1891. The atmosphere at trial was described as being like a theatre, and Edward was called as a witness, the first time the heir to the throne had been compelled <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> since 1411. Gordon-Cumming's senior counsel, the Solicitor General Sir Edward Clarke, did not persuade any of the defendants to change their stories, but he highlighted several inaccuracies and serious discrepancies in their evidence. Despite a strong and well-regarded closing speech by Clarke on Gordon-Cumming's behalf, the judge's summing up was described as biased by some, and the jury found against the lieutenant colonel.|$|E

Going from Basilan to the mainland required three or more hours of travel. To fix the problem, Representative Juan Alano filed a bill in Congress to separate Basilan from Zamboanga City.

5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after he failed <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin {{was arrested in}} for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could {{be traced back to}} McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Piza√±a and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Piza√±a heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Piza√±a and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
