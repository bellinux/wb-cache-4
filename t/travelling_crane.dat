Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
6000|$|Four-and-twenty {{engines in}} {{every stage of}} {{decomposition}} stand in one huge shop. A <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> runs overhead, and the men have hauled up {{one end of a}} bright vermilion loco. The effect is the silence of a scornful stare--just such a look as a colonel's portly wife gives through her pince-nez at the audacious subaltern. Engines are the [...] "livest" [...] things that man ever made. They glare through their spectacle-plates, they tilt their noses contemptuously, and when their insides are gone they adorn themselves with red lead, and leer like decayed beauties; and in the Jamalpur works there is no escape from them. The shops can hold fifty without pressure, and on occasion as many again. Everywhere there are engines, and everywhere brass domes lie about on the ground like huge helmets in a pantomime. The silence is the weirdest touch of all. Some sprightly soul--an apprentice be sure--has daubed in red lead on the end of an iron tool-box a caricature of some friend who is evidently a riveter. The picture has all the interest of an Egyptian cartouche, for it shows that men have been here, and that the engines do not have it all their own way.|$|E
50|$|Several railway {{tracks were}} laid at the Cairns wharves. The {{existing}} railway lines were laid at {{approximately the same}} time as the concrete wharves.

50|$|In 1976, the forges {{were sold}} to Experton-Revollier, a group from Isère. Modernization was necessary, as there was no <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> or {{electric}} motor-driven machinery (instead of belt transmission). Improvements went {{hand in hand with}} the retention of the steel rolling mill, the last of its type in France and one of the last in Europe.|$|E

50|$|He {{is first}} listed as an “engineer” living {{back with his}} parents in Edinburgh in 1861. In 1862, living in Stockport, {{he took out a}} patent for the {{improvement}} of steam engines and boilers. In 1863 he purchased a former brewery in Vauxhall in London and created the Vauxhall Iron Works. In 1863 he invented an overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>crane,</b> which was successfully used to construct Blackfriars Bridge over the River Thames in central London.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{external}} change was the two-story glass extension on {{one half of}} the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> An electrical substation, taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company EDF Energy while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.|$|E

The face brickwork is variously painted and unpainted and a number of remnant openings and brackets provide evidence of the building's previous function.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{transport}} girders {{from their}} base in Lyttelton, on 25 June 1906, Andersons opened a large foundry, (285 ft x 30 ft) to fabricate the steel on site. It was {{powered by a}} wood-burning boiler and steam engine, with electric lights and machines. Electric overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and a cableway (or Blondin) eased on-site transport. A water turbine drove the stone crusher and concrete mixer (adverts from the period said they used 9,000 bags of Portland Cement).|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{became a}} fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers. He taught briefly as a {{lecturer}} in the School of Engineering of Lagos State Polytechnic.

He left Schroeder to start his own business. In 1990 he founded Kresta Laurel, an engineering firm specialising in elevators, overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and hoists.|$|R
50|$|Bristol General Hospital {{is located}} on the Eastern quay of the basin. When {{constructed}} in 1859, the hospital was built with basement warehouse space to defray its operating costs. The Southern quay has never had any substantial buildings on it and for many years was used by Holms Sand & Gravel Co. as a depot for building materials, brought in by boat and offloaded into road vehicles. A <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> on an overhead gantry was used to handle these.|$|E

50|$|The Kedron {{substation}} {{remained in}} service until the phasing out of Brisbane's trams {{in the late}} 1960s. In 1969 the line was closed and the substation's electrical equipment was removed, though the <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> remained. The building became a State Emergency Services Depot and changes {{were made to the}} interior to accommodate this use. The lower level of the original two level floor has been extended to park a rescue boat and a mezzanine level was inserted in the mid 1980s. A single storey brick garage has been added.|$|E
50|$|In 1874 Samuel Fielding {{died and}} his two sons, James and John Fielding, became joint junior {{partners}} with James Platt. The company was expanding rapidly at this time, building new equipment and registering patents. The firm built furnaces, hydraulic presses, <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes,</b> and machinery for processing girders. In 1874 they made a 900 ton flanging press. The firm won awards for its equipment at Philadelphia (1876), Paris (1878) and London (1880). A wide range of steam and oil engines were developed.|$|R

50|$|Before the Dublin Port {{facilities}} {{moved down}} river, {{this was the}} area of the Dublin quays where ships were loaded and unloaded.

A number of buildings on the campshires were also subject to renovation early in the 21st century.|$|R
