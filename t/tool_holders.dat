500|$|Rotary {{broaching}} requires two tooling {{components: a}} <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> and a broach. The leading (cutting) {{edge of the}} broach has a contour matching the desired final shape. The broach is mounted in a special <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> that allows it to freely rotate. The <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1Â°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for the broach to cut the workpiece. Either the workpiece or the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is rotated. If the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is rotated, the misalignment causes the broach to appear as though it is [...] "wobbling", which is {{the origin of the}} term wobble broach.|$|R

40|$|In {{the turning}} {{operation}} chatter or vibration {{is a frequent}} problem, which affects {{the result of the}} machining, and, in particular, the surface finish. Tool life is also influenced by vibration. Severe acoustic noise in the working environment frequently occurs as a result of dynamic motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. These problems can be reduced by active control of machine-tool vibration based on high magnetostrictive actuators. However, both the physical features and properties of a active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction based on high magnetostrictive actuators and the fact that this type of actuators generally have a non-linear behaviour highly reduce its applicability to the general lathe and turning operation. Therefor, a new generation embedded active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators have been developed. Based on spectrum estimates, both coherence spectrum and frequency response function estimates has been calculated for both the old <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction and the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank. From the results it follows that the phase delay is smaller and the linearity of the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank are superior compared to the old technology. It is also obvious that physical features and properties of new generation embedded active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators fits the general lathe application...|$|R

50|$|Compared to the {{industrial}} stakes, commercial solutions are rare. To analyse the problems and to propose solutions, only few experts propose their services. Computational software for stability lobes and measurement devices are proposed but, in spite of widespread publicity, they remain relatively rarely used. Lastly, vibration sensors are often integrated into machining centers but they are used mainly for wear diagnosis of the tools or the spindle.New Generation <b>Tool</b> <b>Holders</b> and especially the Hydraulic Expansion <b>Tool</b> <b>Holders</b> minimise the undesirable effects of vibration to a large extent. First of all, the precise control of total indicator reading to less than 3 micrometres helps reduce vibrations due to balanced load on cutting edges and the little vibration created thereon is absorbed largely by the oil inside the chambers of the Hydraulic Expansion Tool Holder.|$|E
50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it.

The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} â³ to â³ in diameter or <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle.
