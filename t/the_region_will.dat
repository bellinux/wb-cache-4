Instead conditions on the ground would determine troop levels and strategy. This was confirmed on August 24, 2017 by the military commander for United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John W. Nicholson, who described the new strategy in Afghanistan as defining success by conditions on the ground and not “arbitrary timelines.” U.S. President Trump said in his August 21,017 speech that [...] "victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al-Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over the country, and stopping mass terror attacks against Americans before they emerge."

Its construction is due to the tireless work of the priest José Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, more famously known as the Cura Gaucho.
