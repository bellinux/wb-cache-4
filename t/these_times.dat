5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during <b>these</b> <b>times.</b> A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn.

5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes.

Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At <b>these</b> <b>times,</b> {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near <b>these</b> <b>times,</b> they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at <b>these</b> <b>times.</b> It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E

5|$|Willie Alben Barkley, {{the eldest}} of John Wilson and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley's eight children, was born November 24, 1877. His grandmother, midwife Amanda Barkley, {{delivered}} him in the log house she lived in with her husband, Alben, in Wheel, Kentucky.

5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During <b>these</b> <b>times,</b> it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in <b>these</b> <b>times,</b> cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E

5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between <b>these</b> <b>times</b> the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during <b>these</b> <b>times</b> and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito {{to be able to}} fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in <b>these</b> <b>times,</b> was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION We {{currently}} have three {{main sources of}} information on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
