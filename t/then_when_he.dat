When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

25|$|For the battalion, {{the result}} was that a number of its personnel, {{including}} the commanding officer, Pringle, were repatriated to New Zealand for discharge. As the battalion's numbers dwindled, in April the furthest positions were abandoned, with 'B' Company being moved to Stirling Island alongside 'A' Company at Soala Lakes and 'D' Company moved to Lakemba Cove where it was co-located with 'C' Company. In May the battalion was relieved by an American unit from the US 93rd Division and was withdrawn back to New Caledonia on board the USS Tryon.

Shortly thereafter, the 36th Battalion was disbanded, although a number of battalion personnel were subsequently sent to Italy as reinforcements for units of the 2nd Division.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{man with}} both players and spectators alike {{due to his}} cheerful {{disposition}} on the field. Born in Mossel Bay and educated in Cape Town and then Charterhouse School, England, Charlie Vintcent, was without doubt the most versatile South African sportsman of his time. He excelled in many sport he played representing both Western Province and Transvaal at rugby, obtaining his national colours for soccer, a sport he did much to promote on the Reef and as an athlete he was the Transvaal sprint champion in the events from the 100 yards to 440 yards for three years from 1889 to 1891, besides being competitive at both the long and high jump events. Charlie was a left-handed all-rounder who played in both tests in the first home series against England {{as well as the}} only test of the 1891/92 series against the second English touring side. He owed his original selection to his fine performance for Kimberley in the fifth match of the tour falling 13 runs short of a century and taking nine wickets in the match for one hundred and five runs off eighty nine overs. He was unable to carry this form into the Internationals and his Test record is not a true reflection of his ability. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a long career in provincial cricket which lasted some twenty seasons playing first an important role for Transvaal in the early Currie Cup fixtures, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> returned to the Southern Cape, he captained them in their only appearance at provincial level, by which stage he was close to forty years of age. Charlie Vintcent lived a long and active life, dying in 1943 at the age of seventy seven.|$|E

500|$|The manuscripts were {{produced}} in different places, and each manuscript reflects the biases of its scribes. It {{has been argued}} that the Chronicle should be regarded as propaganda, produced by Alfred's court and written with the intent of glorifying Alfred and creating loyalty. This is not universally accepted, but the origins of the manuscripts clearly colour both the description of interactions between Wessex and other kingdoms, and the descriptions of the Vikings' depredations. An example {{can be seen in the}} entry for 829, which describes Egbert's invasion of Northumbria. According to the Chronicle, after Egbert conquered Mercia and Essex, he became a [...] "bretwalda", implying overlordship of all of England. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> marched into Northumbria, the Northumbrians offered him [...] "submission and peace". The Northumbrian chronicles incorporated into Roger of Wendover's 13th-century history give a different picture: [...] "When Egbert had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of {{the stars}} of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an {{unspecified}} role, later revealed to be Mike Peterson, the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season. Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role. In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] They were described as [...] "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward." [...] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, [...] "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season. Jed Whedon said that [...] "We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it." [...] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett. Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand, David Conrad as Ian Quinn, and Ruth Negga as Raina.|$|E
500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together.
