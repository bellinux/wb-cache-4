While some cases of sexual exploitation involve predatory doctors, many other cases represent the culmination of a series of boundary crossings (non-exploitative departures from usual practice). The deliberate move <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>formality</b> in medicine has increased the likelihood of boundary crossings and violations. There are also individual doctor risk factors; boundary violations appear more likely when doctors are under stress, with insufficient emotional support. Preventive strategies include continuing education about ethics and the management of professional boundaries, along with appropriate psychological support structures for doctors. Doctors are often involved in other professional relationships as teachers, supervisors and team leaders; inappropriate sexual behaviour in these relationships is harassment. Public pressure for more punitive responses is likely if the profession is not seen to be doing all it can to deal with these issues effectively, and to be cooperating with other responsible agencies.

40|$|Early design studies, {{especially}} for advanced projects, are often considered as not-so-relevant {{and far from}} reality since the outcome is usually and “solely” a set of documents covering the overall system trades, presentations describing the related design evolution, Excel sheets providing the major system budgets {{and a set of}} 3 D-drawings showing the preliminary configuration and accommodation of the spacecraft. Compared to critical procurement, integrating and testing activities, the pre-development phases – although doubtlessly very interesting for everyone - are not always sufficiently prestigious in the engineering world. However, in the last years there is an increasing effort noticeable in putting more effort into structuring and improving space development projects right from the beginning by applying various systems engineering methodologies. These include also Concurrent Engineering (CE), a collaborative, iterative and communicative approach in which all relevant disciplines including the customer, work simultaneously together in a guided and typically co-located manner. The principal engineering tasks within such an activity are clear, but the additional component of constant and intensive interaction amongst the domain representatives could create e. g. misunderstandings, irritations, displeasures and eventually a suboptimal design solution. Although the advantages of such CE studies, such as quality increase, time and cost decrease as well as mutual education of team members, far outweigh the risk carried by the elevated social component, one has to carefully be aware of the squad to guide the project in the right direction, particularly in such an early stage. As of today, the Institute of Space Systems of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has performed about 50 CE studies, mainly lasting one to three weeks, with many different internal and external teams for exploration and satellite missions as well as launch vehicle design. During these activities, the authors have identified several basic rules for successful studies, mainly related <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>formality,</b> providing transparency, facilitating honesty and engaging well-balanced data sharing. The present paper describes our lessons learnt, focusing on the various communication means which are necessary within a comprehensive group of engineers and scientists, and points out the potentials and dangers when treating team members in front of others during plenary workshop sessions or before and afterwards. It summarises a set of Dos and Don’ts which should be taken into account when conducting such interdisciplinary and often multi-cultural events, in order to seriously improve the envisaged design and moreover, to elaborate on the reputation of early system studies...|$|R

Governments determine pension schemes, which {{are defined by}} the minimum requirements to obtain a pension: {{the number of years}} contributing to the system, the minimum age, and the replacement rates. These three elements in the model determine the minimum length of working life and the condition to qualify for higher pension benefits when an individual reaches pensionable age. Lower replacement rates and loose rules <b>reduce</b> <b>formality,</b> and stricter rules increase it. Changes mainly occur in the last 10 years of an individual’s working life, when they are closer to reaching the minimum thresholds.|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the implementation}} of the G 20 /OECD Principles of Corporate Governance by Russia in comparison to other BRICS countries and Indonesia. Originally, this document was adopted by OECD in 1999. The last (third) version of the document was developed in 2014 – 2015, with an active involvement of G 20 countries, and was adopted at the G 20 Summit in Antalya (Turkey) in November 2015. Dramatic changes are absent in the new document, however, it contains several new recommendations, which became necessary after the global economic crisis of 2008 – 2009. The article is focused on the actions of six countries that were chosen for the analysis, {{as well as on the}} real changes in these countries. The author takes into account OECD recommendations on the assessment of implementation of G 20 /OECD principles. According to these recommendations, researchers should not pay too much attention to the quantitative analysis, since many important issues are unobservable for them. Considering this, the author accentuates qualitative research methods and comparative analysis. The results of the study show that Brazil, Indonesia and Russia were most active in implementation, while South Africa and China lacked any actions, and India achieved only partial implementation. Despite the large number of facts documenting formal implementation of corporate governance principles in Russia during the last years, Russia definitely lacks real improvements. This is true for information disclosure (including data on the management remuneration), gender diversity on corporate boards, the share of independent directors, etc. Moreover, Russian companies are characterized by high concentration of capital, and the role of boards is often <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>formalities.</b> According to the results of the research, similar limitations are found in the systems of corporate governance of other countries covered by this study. Taking into account the limited accessibility of information on real changes and real implementation in other BRICS countries and Indonesia, the author assesses the Russia’s efforts as “substantial implementation”, though due to the presence of gaps between actions and changes, Russia’s efforts should be assessed as “partial implementation. ...|$|R

Based on ISO 9001 evaluation, the quality of HR at PT. Jaya Kusuma Sarana Bali (PT. JKS Bali) that measured by indicators of objectives and targets from each division concluded {{that the quality of}} HR still need to be improved. By knowing the profile of the current and preferred organizational culture, it can be identified the strategy required to achieve the vision and mission of the organization. This study aimed to analyze the culture profile of PT. JKS Bali based on their employees perception, in order to identify strategies  for improving their  HR performance. The method used is an OCAI (Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument) analysis method and a survey using the OCAI questionnaire. The analysis involved identification of the culture profiles that measured in 6 key dimensions (i. e. : Dominant Characteristics, Organizational Leadership, Management of Employees, Organization Glue, Strategic Emphases and Criteria of Success) which can represent the four culture types of an organization (i. e. : Clan, Adhocracy, Market dan Hierarchy). The result suggests that the profile of the current and preferred organizational culture at PT. JKS Bali does not require significant changes. The strategies that need to be implemented derived from six key dimensions, Applying more flexible organizational leadership but also against the rules, Managing the employees who prioritize teamwork, <b>Reducing</b> <b>formalities</b> working procedures, focusing on the company's internal, emphasizing human resource development and employment commitments...|$|R
