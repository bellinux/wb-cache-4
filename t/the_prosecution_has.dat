25|$|A {{different}} {{pattern has}} emerged in criminal cases.

Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.|$|E

If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|Sex Trafficking/New York: The Flores-Carreto family sex-trafficking ring {{operated}} between Tenancingo, Tlaxcala, Mexico, and Queens, New York, from 1991 to 2004 {{and involved}} brothels in the New York metropolitan area. ICE began its investigation in December 2003 after {{the mother of}} a trafficking victim reported to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City that her daughter had been kidnapped and was being held against her will in New York. ICE discovered that male members of the Flores-Carreto family romantically lured young Mexican women to the United States, where they were forced into prostitution through beatings and threats against their children, who were residing with the traffickers' mother in MÃ©xico. Victims who became pregnant were forced to have abortions. In April 2005, Josue Flores-Carreto, Gerardo Flores-Carreto and Daniel Perez Alfonso, a brothel manager, were sentenced to 50, 50, and 25 years imprisonment respectively, for multiple offenses related to forced prostitution. In January 2007, Mexico extradited Consuelo Caretto Valencia, the mother of the Carreto brothers, to the United States, where she was charged with conspiring on sex trafficking and related offenses. On July 22, 2008, she pleaded guilty to sex trafficking and is pending sentencing for that crime. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> been one of the largest sex trafficking cases brought under the provisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.

25|$|Counsel for the Public Prosecutor {{opens his}} or her case by stating shortly {{the nature of the}} offence charged and the {{evidence}} by which the accused's guilt is proposed to be proved. The prosecution witnesses are then examined, cross-examined for the defence and, if necessary, re-examined by the prosecution. When the case for the prosecution is concluded, the defence may invite the Court to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no case to answer. The Court must decide whether there is evidence against the accused which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies every element of the charge against him or her. If there is no such evidence, the accused must be acquitted. If the Court finds that a case against the accused has been made out, it must call on the accused to give {{his or her}} defence. It is up to the accused {{to decide whether or not}} to offer a defence. If the accused elects to do so, he or she, or his or her advocate, may open the case for the defence, stating the facts or law on which the accused intends to rely and commenting on the evidence for the prosecution. The accused may then examine his or her witnesses, and after their cross-examination by the prosecution and re-examination by the defence, may sum up his or her case. The prosecution may then call persons as witnesses or recall persons already examined for re-examination for rebuttal purposes, and such rebuttal witnesses may be cross-examined by the defence and re-examined by the prosecution. Whether or not the accused has adduced evidence, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> the right to reply on the whole case.|$|E

2500|$|However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 {{stipulates}} that where a defendant relies on some [...] "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" [...] in his defence, the legal {{burden of proof}} as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk {{in charge of a}} motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.|$|E
2500|$|Scottish {{trials are}} based on an {{adversarial}} approach.

[...] Following the Prosecution case, the defence may move a motion of no case to answer if the worst <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime. [...] If there remains a case to answer, the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution, with cross examination being permitted after each witness. Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence, the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard. [...] The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict. Juries are composed of fifteen residents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case has}} been met with several {{setbacks}} such as {{the death of a}} suspect, multiple changes to the prosecutorial team, and disputes with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> been heavily criticized for their refusal to produce evidence against the defendants, missing multiple discovery deadlines, and for making frequent changes to the charges against the defendants with little explanation. The TBI even briefly withdrew its services to the entire district after the prosecutor accused them of compromising the case by proceeding [...] "so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI... was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence". Defense attorneys for the men complained that they still had yet to receive a bill of particulars detailing the case against their clients and the results of forensic testing done on evidence from the case over a year after the arrests were made and that the prosecution had missed multiple discovery deadlines, leading attorneys for the defendants to file motions to dismiss charges on the grounds of [...] "silence or stonewalling". The arrests took place in early 2014, but it wasn't until July 2015 that it was announced that the defendants finally received access to all the evidence against them.|$|E

60|$|All the {{precedents}} previous to {{the trial}} of Warren Hastings, Esquire, seem to your Committee to be uniform. The Judges had constantly refused to give an opinion {{on any of the}} powers, privileges, or competencies of either House. But in the present instance your Committee has found, with great concern, a further matter of innovation. Hitherto the constant practice has been to put questions to the Judges but in the three following ways: as, 1st, A question of pure abstract law, without reference to any case, or merely upon an A.B. case stated to them; 2dly, To the legal construction of some act of Parliament; 3dly, To report the course of proceeding in the courts below upon an abstract case. Besides these three, your Committee knows not of a single example of any sort, during the course of any judicial proceeding at the bar of the House of Lords, whether <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> been by indictment, by information from the Attorney-General, or by impeachment of the House of Commons.|$|E

Of other evidence, there is not one jot or tittle. No attempt has been made to prove that the prisoner was in the habit of consorting with bad characters; no attempt has been made to show any connection, whatever, between him and the men who came in a horse and trap across the hills, for the purpose of effecting a burglary at Mr. Ellison's; and who, as we know, did effect it.

Now I am not interested in how they died, or when they died, or whether they died. But I am interested in another analogous question--that of how they were born, and when they were born, and whether they were born. Do not misunderstand me. I do not dispute the existence of these women, or the veracity of those who have witnessed to them. I merely remark on the notable fact that only one of these victims, the Maidenhead girl, is described as having any home or parents. All the rest are boarders or birds of passage--a guest, a solitary dressmaker, a bachelor-girl doing typewriting. Lady Bullingdon, looking from her turrets, which she bought from the Whartons with the old soap-boiler's money when she jumped at marrying an unsuccessful gentleman from Ulster--Lady Bullingdon, looking out from those turrets, did really see an object which she describes as Green. Mr. Trip, of Hanbury and Bootle, really did have a typewriter betrothed to Smith. Miss Gridley, though idealistic, is absolutely honest. She did house, feed, and teach a young woman whom Smith succeeded in decoying away. We admit that all these women really lived. But we still ask whether they were ever born?" ...|$|E
