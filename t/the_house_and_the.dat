5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E
5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area {{were subject to}} a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies {{was made by the}} State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E

5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{the farm}} was managed by Smith's younger brother, Herman W. Smith and nephew, Frank A. Harris. In 1900, the two married Lula and Florence Munger, sisters, and both {{resided in the}} house. William H. Smith deeded the house to his brother and nephew in 1921. Smith died in 1951 and his widow and Frank Harris, shortly before his death, sold <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 103 acres (41.6 hectare) of land to the Town of East Lyme for $34,000. The two widows {{continued}} {{to live in the}} house until they went to a nursing home. The land served as a farm under the Avery family including a dairy and cattle farm; the dairy farm would continue to operate under the Harris family. Portions of the land were later used for the construction of Interstate 95 and two East Lyme schools. The two schools are the East Lyme Junior High School (East Lyme Middle School) and Lillie B. Haines Elementary School.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered {{the house to}} be shelled to set it on fire, resulting {{in the destruction of}} all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost of maintaining <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{sculptor}} Emilio Sala {{was responsible}} for both {{the internal and external}} sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs {{on the roof of the}} building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers depicting huge catfish strangled in the stems of lotus flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> building material.|$|E

5|$|The Tudor mansion was {{dismantled}} but, {{concerned that}} the stone would swiftly disintegrate during the demolition phase, Weddell's advisers ordered that a small explosive device be triggered in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> undamaged stones salvaged. However, the explosion {{had the effect of}} splitting the walls intact meaning that much of the building could be salvaged and shipped to the United States. The first shipments arrived in Richmond, Virginia in early 1926, but they were soaked in seawater and had to be dried in a barn for up to six months. From the very beginning, the Weddells planned on deeding the house to the Virginia Historical Society and allocating the west wing of the structure as a museum once it was rebuilt in Virginia. The Weddells also intended the structure to become the society's new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{bicameral}} Texas Legislature {{consists of}} the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senate, with 31 members.

The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days, but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably, the Legislature cannot call itself into session). The state's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year's September 1 to the current year's August 31. Thus, the FY 2015 dates from September 1, 2014 through August 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E
