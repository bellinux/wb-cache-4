In Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, every respondent <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> areas exposed to coastal flooding according to the hazards maps but they perceived living on average at 980  m from areas exposed to coastal flooding. Respondents in Barneville-Carteret perceived living on average at 245  m from exposed areas, that being 2.6 times more than the average objective distance. 27.2 % of the respondents (25 individuals) who actually <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas (according to experts’ hazard maps) estimated that <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas. 9.8 % of the respondents (9 individuals) who didn’t actually <b>live</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that <b>they</b> didn’t <b>live</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas. 9.8 % (9 individuals) who didn’t actually <b>live</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that <b>they</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> exposed areas.

In mountainous regions, they often dwell at higher {{elevations}} in summer, migrating down slope for winter.

Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.|$|E
5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals.

Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
