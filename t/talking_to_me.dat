People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That {{was the first time}} I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E

500|$|The album {{departed}} from the optimistic psychedelic soul sound of the group's 1960s records, instead embracing a darker sound featuring dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals. Stone reworked 1969's [...] "Thank You" [...] single as a slower, closing track, [...] "Thank You For <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> Africa" [...] which, according to AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald was a blues and gospel influenced examination of urban tension {{and the end of}} the 1960s, [...] "perhaps the most frightening recording from the dawn of the 1970s, capturing all of the drama, ennui, and hedonism of the decade to come with almost a clairvoyant feel." [...] "Africa Talks to You" [...] is a nine-minute funk jam written in response to Sly Stone's backlash from estranged fans and friends, record industry associates, and the media. According to biographer Eddie Santiago, the lyrics cynically portray [...] "fame and its cold retrogression into perceived insanity", with a chorus that reflects [...] "Sly's feelings on being cut down in his prime like a tree in the forest." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010.

500|$|Various {{artists have}} written songs {{entitled}} Glastonbury {{or about the}} festival including Nizlopi, The Waterboys and Scouting for Girls. Cosmic Rough Riders included [...] "Glastonbury Revisited" [...] on their album Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine (Poptones) in 2000. Amy Macdonald, in her song [...] "Let's Start a Band" [...] referenced Glastonbury: [...] "Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star." [...] Robbie Williams, in his song [...] "The 90s", refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That: [...] "Everybody's worried 'what the fuck's wrong with Robbie? He's not answering his phone, he's not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury'." [...] Joe Strummer wrote the song [...] "Coma Girl" [...] about his experiences at Glastonbury, — in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival. U2 wrote a song titled [...] "Glastonbury" [...] {{that was supposed to}} premier with their appearance at the festival, but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel. They instead premiered it in a concert in Turin on their 360° Tour. Marcus Brigstocke's comic creation Giles Wemmbley Hogg had a special mock-documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off series. Deborah Crombie's novel A Finer End takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival. Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne's 2014 Radio 4 show The New Blur Album. Roxy Music did a song and album called Avalon, which is the ancient name for Glastonbury (Isle of Avalon).|$|E
