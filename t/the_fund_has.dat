25|$|The Alaska Constitution {{was written}} {{so as to}} {{discourage}} dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing {{during the time of}} its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> <b>has</b> grown to $50billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs. Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.|$|E

In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested.

500|$|The fandom is {{considered}} to be charitable, raising money for a number of different efforts. The Brony Thank You Fund was originally established to create a fan-funded advertisement to air on Hub Network as a thank you to the show's creators in November 2012.
