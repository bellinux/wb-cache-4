5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one and wait for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E

5|$|A day later, {{the owners}} of the {{previous}} bridge — the International Railway Company (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership of border crossings. In the end, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was not}} {{prominently}} {{involved in}} the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros, he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government, the Primera Junta. Along with Juan José Castelli, he promoted harsh policies against the supporters of the former government and the strengthening of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one.</b> These policies were detailed at a secret document, the Operations plan; some historians dispute its authorship. Moreno organized military campaigns to Paraguay and Upper Peru, and ensured the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He established the first Argentine newspaper, La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, and translated Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract into Spanish.|$|E

5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one.</b> This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E
5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one,</b> plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E

Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one,</b> although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this. There is no evidence that any work was carried out under the terms of the act.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} railroad {{bridge was}} replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that, along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River, was one of the United States' first all steel railroad bridges. This bridge was constructed from Bessemer steel, which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position, allowing the old structure to be removed and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> put in place in 27½ hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|E

5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E

5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was {{a highway}} {{bridge over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount {{was a far cry from}} the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E
