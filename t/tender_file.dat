His rival Gopala Krishna [...] "GK" [...] (Nagarjuna) is the 'Boss' of GK Constructions. GK {{has the power to}} handle goons as well as the real estate business. He calls for applications from MBA graduates as his personal secretary. None of the applicants reach his expectations. He accidentally meets Anuradha [...] "Anu" [...] (Nayantara) and thinks that she is fit for the job. As a 'Boss' he is tough with his staff but has lots of concern over them. During a trip to Malaysia, Anu and GK get closer and Anu loses her heart to GK. When she is about to confess her love, Anu gets involved in a petty issue and faces the wrath of GK. Consequently, she requested to resign from her job, while she is on duty for her last one month, GK calls for interviews for his personal secretary again and zeroes in on Sruthi (Poonam Bajwa). It is revealed that she was planted in GK's office by SRK. In order to get her father Ramamurthy released from a false case, Sruthi steals a <b>tender</b> <b>file.</b> However, she does not hand it over to SRK and demands her father's release. The crooked SRK does not listen to her. At this juncture, she tries to escape from the scene and is saved by GK at the insistence of Anu. However, Anu is injured in the attack by goons in the process, but goes straight to the Tenders office and files the tender to save GK from a huge loss and to fulfill his ambition of securing his dream project. When GK is about to thank her, she admits her love for him, only to learn of his past. In the flashback, GK reveals that he loved Sanjana (Shriya) and married her. She died in a tsunami shortly after. He says he can't replace Sanjana. GK refuses Anu's love politely. As time goes by, Sanjana's mother Sumitra (Sumalatha) dies of illness in Malaysia and her husband Viswanath (Nasar) tells GK that her last wish is the marriage of GK with Anu. GK also gets a feeling that Sanjana also wants the same. He returns to India and unites with Anu and the film ends on a happy note.|$|E
