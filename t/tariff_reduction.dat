500|$|There was {{relatively}} little financial {{legislation in the}} 1880s. By that time, fewer bonds were necessary, as the government now ran a consistent surplus which by 1882 reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to balance the budget; Democrats wished to lower tariffs to reduce revenues {{and the cost of}} imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on internal improvements and reduce excise taxes. Congress passed a law creating a committee to study <b>tariff</b> <b>reduction,</b> but Arthur appointed mostly protectionists to it. In December 1882, the committee submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 and 25%. The commission's recommendations were ignored, however, as the House Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided a 10% reduction. After conference with the Senate, the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%, but it did remove or reduce many excise taxes. Sherman supported the bill, more for the excise reduction than for the tariff changes. The bill, known as the Tariff of 1883 (or, by detractors, as the [...] "Mongrel Tariff") passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law, but it had no effect on the surplus.|$|E

[...] Though he brought him into his cabinet in 1921 in part {{at the urging of}} Progressive leader Thomas Crerar, King found Stewart to be an {{inadequate}} protector of western interests—especially in his advocacy of <b>tariff</b> <b>reduction,</b> which King found lacklustre—and did not trust his political advice on the west. [...] By 1925 he was considering appointing Stewart to the Senate, to remove him from active political involvement, but was handicapped by the absence of any other Alberta representation in his cabinet. [...] In 1926 Stewart served as an emissary from King to recruit Saskatchewan Premier Charles Avery Dunning to the federal cabinet; the mission fulfilled, King kept Stewart in cabinet but wrote in his diary that all matters pertaining to Alberta were to be [...] "left to Dunning to do as he thinks best". [...] By 1927, King complained that Stewart had [...] "no grip" [...] on the province of which he had once been Premier, and in 1930 he wrote [...] "Organization in Alberta is terrible. [...] Stewart is worse than useless, is like an old woman, with no real control of situation." [...] In the 1930 federal election Dunning and Crerar were both defeated; King complained that it was [...] "perfectly terrible to have Stewart alone representing the West." [...] When Stewart too went down to defeat in 1935, King was pleased [...] "not to have to consider him" [...] in assembling his new cabinet, and opted instead to leave Alberta unrepresented to punish it for failing to elect any Liberals.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three independent empirical studies that {{examine the relationship}} between trade and wages for Chinese manufacturing industries for the period 2002 - 2006. Chapter 2 uses highly detailed firm-level industrial production data merged with product-level trade transaction data to make a direct test of Amiti and Davis (2011) model. The potential endogeneity issue of tariffs is addressed in several ways although our results support the premise that post-WTO period <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> were exogenous. In Chapters 3 and 4 we pay close attention to processing trade. Chapter 3 reexamines the relationship between <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> and firm wages taking into account the special tariff treatment given to processing firms. We find that processing firms pay higher wages following a fall in firm output tariffs. However, non-processing firms pay higher wages after a fall in firm input tariffs. Finally, Chapter 4 examines the impact of <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> on the decision of firms to switch between different modes of exporting and explores how export switching affects firm wages through trade liberalization. The results highlight that input <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> at the firm level determine a firm’s decision and direction of export switching. The future research ideas are also concluded...|$|R
