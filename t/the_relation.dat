5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of black holes (BHs) on the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_bulge planes {{as a function of}} time in disk galaxies undergoing mergers. We begin the simulations with the progenitor black hole masses being initially below (Delta log M_BH=- 2), on (Delta log M_BH= 0) and above (Delta log M_BH= 0. 5) <b>the</b> observed local <b>relations.</b> <b>The</b> final <b>relations</b> are rapidly established after the final coalescense of the galaxies and their BHs. Progenitors with low initial gas fractions (f_gas= 0. 2) starting below <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> evolve onto <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> (Delta log M_BH=- 0. 18), progenitors on <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> stay there (Delta log M_BH= 0) and finally progenitors above <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> evolve towards <b>the</b> <b>relations,</b> but still remaining above them (Delta log M_BH= 0. 35). Mergers in which the progenitors have high initial gas fractions (f_gas= 0. 8) evolve above <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> in all cases (Delta log M_BH= 0. 5). We find that the initial gas fraction is the prime source of scatter in <b>the</b> observed <b>relations,</b> dominating over <b>the</b> scatter arising from the evolutionary stage of the merger remnants. The fact that BHs starting above <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> do not evolve onto <b>the</b> <b>relations,</b> indicates that our simulations rule out the scenario in which overmassive BHs evolve onto <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> through gas-rich mergers. By implication our simulations thus disfavor the picture in which supermassive BHs develop significantly before their parent bulges.
