The variance on PCs beyond the third (all 5 % or less of the total) trail off gradually suggesting no strong patterns of intercorrelation amongst the variables. Nonetheless, the first two PCs together only represent 36 % of <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> variability and the first four only 49 %. In fact, it requires the first 27 PCs as a group to account for 90 % of <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> variation.

This expanded the <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> time {{while at the same}} time decreasing the resolution.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the states of weakly coupled linear systems from sampled measurements. We assume that the total capacity available to the sensors to transmit their samples to a network manager {{in charge of the}} estimation is bounded above, and that each sample requires the same amount of communication. Our goal is then to find an optimal allocation of the capacity to the sensors so that the average estimation error is minimized. We show that when the total available channel capacity is large, this resource allocation problem can be recast as a strictly convex optimization problem, and hence there exists a unique optimal allocation of the capacity. We further investigate how this optimal allocation varies as the available capacity increases. In particular, we show that if the coupling among the subsystems is weak, then the sampling rate allocated to each sensor is nondecreasing in the <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> rate, and is strictly increasing if and only if the <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> rate exceeds a certain threshold...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Risk Stratification has an {{important}} place in cardiac surgery to identify high-risk cases and optimally allocate resources. Hence various risk scoring systems have been tried to predict mortality. The aim {{of the present study}} was to validate the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) in Indian cardiac surgical patients. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee clearance, data on EuroSCORE II variables were collected for all patients > 18 years undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve surgery and mixed (CABG + valve) procedures between January 2011 and December 2012. Mortality prediction was done using the online calculator from the site www. euroscore. org. The calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was analysed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and discrimination was analysed by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and calculating area under the curve (AUC). The analysis was done in the <b>total</b> <b>sample,</b> CABG, valve surgery and in mixed procedures. Results: The overall observed mortality was 5. 7 % in the <b>total</b> <b>sample,</b> 6. 6 % in CABG, 4. 2 % in valve surgeries and 10. 2 % in mixed procedures whereas the predicted mortality was 2. 9 %, 3. 1 %, 2. 4 %, 5. 1 % in <b>total</b> <b>sample,</b> CABG, valve surgery and mixed procedure, respectively. The significance (P value) of Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 0. 292, 0. 45, 0. 56 and 1 for the <b>total</b> <b>sample,</b> CABG, valve surgery and mixed procedure, respectively, indicating good calibration. The AUC of ROC was 0. 76, 0. 70, 0. 83 and 0. 78 for <b>total</b> <b>sample,</b> CABG, valve surgery and mixed procedure, respectively. Conclusion: Mortality of the sample was under-predicted by EuroSCORE II. Calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was good for <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> as well as for all surgical subcategories.

Analyses and results are based on an online survey regarding the awareness, values and attitudes of user generated content (UGC) website users towards privacy. The questionnaire consisted of 75 questions and was available online in several European languages, including Maltese, between July and December 2011. For the dissemination of links to this online questionnaire in Malta, a mix of national media and University of Malta channels were used, ranging from banner ads on various media platforms and a media release to personalised emails and a special edition of the University’s Campus e-newsletter. The Malta sample consists of 618 respondents (7. 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>sample),</b> of which 39 % male and 61 % female, with an average age of 29 and 80 % tertiary education.
