5|$|Shankar {{conceived}} {{the film in}} mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, Boys. He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed {{by what he saw}} around him, and his eventual displeasure with society. Pre-production for Anniyan began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Villupuram and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Amsterdam, Mumbai, Malaysia and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the Tyagaraja Aradhana music festival and the extensive use of <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> photography in an action sequence.|$|E
25|$|BITS {{schedules}} each job {{to receive}} only a finite <b>time</b> <b>slice,</b> for which only that job {{is allowed to}} transfer, before it is temporarily paused to give another job a chance to transfer. Higher priority jobs get a higher chunk of <b>time</b> <b>slice.</b> BITS uses round-robin scheduling to process jobs in the same priority and to prevent a large transfer job from blocking smaller jobs.|$|E
25|$|When {{a job is}} newly created, it is {{automatically}} suspended (or paused). It has to be explicitly resumed to be activated. Resuming moves the job to the queued state. On its turn to transfer data, it first connects to the remote server and then starts transferring. After the job's <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> expires, the transfer is temporarily paused, and the job is {{moved back to the}} queued state. When the job gets another <b>time</b> <b>slice,</b> it has to connect again before it can transfer. When the job is complete, BITS transfers ownership of the job to the application that created it.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the least}} common {{multiple}} of the periods is 40, the scheduling pattern can repeat every 40 <b>time</b> <b>slices.</b> But, only 37 of those 40 <b>time</b> <b>slices</b> {{are used by}} P1, P2, or P3. Since the utilization, 92.5%, is not greater than 100%, the system is schedulable with EDF.|$|R

25|$|Relativity of {{simultaneity}} maybe imply eternalism (and hence a B-theory of time), {{where the}} present for different observers is a <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> {{of the four}} dimensional universe. However this suggestion can be countered in the A-Theorist perspective by simply suggesting the perceived lack of simultaneity is simply an illusion caused by varying perspective occurring at different observers.This is demonstrated in the Rietdijk–Putnam argument and additionally in an advanced form of this argument called the Andromeda paradox, created by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose.|$|E
500|$|In a fight sequence, Anniyan {{encounters}} about {{a hundred}} martial artists inside the fictional International Martial Arts School, Vodao. The stunt scene was shot at the JJ Indoor Stadium in Chennai {{over a period of}} 25 days. Peter Hein, the stunt choreographer, is a native of Vietnam. 127 professionally trained fighters were brought in from Vietnam for the shoot. During the rehearsals, the rope, to which the stuntmen were tied and hung upside down, gave in. About a dozen stuntmen crashed down from the balcony, injuring themselves badly. The action sequence was shot using 120 cameras for employing the <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> photography technique, a visual effect known as [...] "bullet time" [...] and popularised by the American film The Matrix (1999), to achieve the frozen-time effect. Shankar had earlier {{toyed with the idea of}} time-slice and tried it while filming the song [...] "Ale Ale" [...] in his Boys. While the time-freeze sequence in Boys was achieved by the linking of 60–62 cameras to attain a 180° rotation, Anniyan employed 120–122 cameras for a 270° rotation.|$|E

2500|$|Digital {{switches}} encode {{the speech}} going on, in 8,000 time slices per second. At each <b>time</b> <b>slice,</b> a digital PCM {{representation of the}} tone is made. The digits are then sent to {{the receiving end of}} the line, where the reverse process occurs, to produce the sound for the receiving phone. In other words, when someone uses a telephone, the speaker's voice is [...] "encoded" [...] then reconstructed for the person on the other end. The speaker's voice is delayed in the process by a small fraction of one second— it is not [...] "live", it is reconstructed— delayed only minutely. (See below for more info.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post matched filter) and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal <b>time</b> <b>slice.</b> What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E

50|$|The {{period of}} time for which a process is allowed to run in a {{preemptive}} multitasking system is generally called the <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> or quantum. The scheduler is run once every <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> to choose the next process to run. The length of each <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> can be critical to balancing system performance vs process responsiveness - if the <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> is too short then the scheduler will consume too much processing time, but if the <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> is too long, processes will take longer to respond to input.|$|E
5000|$|This {{scheduler}} divides processor {{time into}} epochs.

50|$|Just {{before the}} end of <b>time</b> <b>slice</b> 2 in cycle n, a new frame {{transmission}} is started.

Since the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler requires all clocks on all network devices (Ethernet switches and end devices) to be synchronized and the identical schedule to be configured, all devices understand which priority can be sent to the network at any given point in time.
