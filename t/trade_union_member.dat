25|$|A Trades Union Congress Special Conference {{was held}} on 5 April 1982, where trade union leaders voted to support an eight-point plan to oppose the Act. A {{campaign}} pack entitled Fight Tebbit's Law was issued, and a travelling exhibition toured trade union conferences. The TUC encouraged trade unions to refuse to vote in closed shop ballots; to refuse public money for ballots under the Employment Act 1980; to gain the support of other trade unions in disputes; to forbid their members to sit on Industrial Tribunals concerning cases on the closed shop; and to help the TUC co-ordinate industrial action in support of any trade union facing legal action by an employer. A levy of ten pence per <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>member</b> was raised to finance this campaign, which raised over one million pounds to 'Kill the Bill'. Trade union leaders voted overwhelmingly at the TUC Conference on 7 September 1982 for militant resistanceincluding industrial actionto the Act.|$|E

2500|$|Miliband's {{election}} to {{leader of the}} Labour Party {{on the back of}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>member</b> votes had been seen by some as a return to the left following New Labour. Miliband was nicknamed [...] "Red Ed" [...] by some (predominantly right wing) media. After assuming office as Leader of the Opposition, Miliband softened some of the more left-wing ideas he had adopted during the leadership election, but remained committed to causes such as a living wage and the 50% tax rate. However, the Labour Party under Miliband focused on calls for [...] "responsible capitalism" [...] rather than socialism. Labour's shadow chancellor also committed to maintaining some spending cuts scheduled for 2015 and 2016 by the Conservative-led coalition, and was accused of planning to cut the state pension. These were unpopular moves among traditional socialists.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Collectif Assistance Juridique (CAJ) {{independent}} group, a {{total of}} 4,500 people were arrested during the events. Among them, 1,950 were kept in garde à vue and 635 prosecution cases opened. Less than 15% of the arrested people were therefore [...] presented to the magistrates, due to insufficient evidence of alleged legal violations. The CAJ note {{that many of the}} people presented before the courts had no previous criminal record and were far from the profile of [...] "criminal rioters". They included many leaders of the movement, in particular outside Paris. A 24 March 2006 internal administrative order asked the magistrates not to be too lenient on their judgments. 42% of the persons presented before courts passed in immediate comparution, a specific (and controversial) procedure, which allow them to be judged on the spot. During the 1994 demonstrations against the CIP, a student law prepared by Balladur's government, 1000 persons only had been arrested, although the clashes had been more violent. Although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy stated on 16 March that his [...] "priority was to arrest casseurs" [...] (rioters), the independent CAJ (Judicial Assistance Group) noted {{that the vast majority of}} arrestations hadn't been of on-the-spot witnessed violence (flagrant délit) and that many were contested. For example, on 31 March a US citizen visiting Paris was detained by the police, while on 7 April an old man getting out of a supermarket was also detained. Furthermore, many young people from the suburbs were blocked from demonstrating in Paris. According to the government, this was to impede turmoils in the capital, but critics such as the CAJ have spoken of a negation of presumption of innocence and of [...] "racial and social discrimination", since some categories of the population – mainly youth living in housing projects, those accused of having taken part in the riots in autumn 2005 – were blocked from exercising their civil rights of demonstrating against a law that affected them as well as other categories of the population. These blockings in suburbs' train stations have provoked in some cases clashes with the police, for example in Savigny-sur-Orge, in Saint-Denis or in Les Ulis... "There is no evidence which permit us to establish a parallel between the young rioters of November and the disturbing elements of this spring", notes the CAJ report, countering the Interior Minister's claims. Furthermore, police abuse was reported on a number of cases, including Cyril Ferez, a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>member</b> who entered coma state for several weeks following the 18 March demonstration. In Caen Charlotte entered coma for a day; Victor had two ribs broken, etc. A three-year-old child was placed 24 hours in observation after having inhalaed gas. On 16 March, the Parisian préfecture de police announced that 18 demonstrators had been injured. The IGS (internal affairs department) was charged of Cyril Ferez' case (who was in coma for several weeks) and litigation was initiated against police officers allegedly excessively brutal and violent during arrests. Additionally, cooperation between the police forces and the trade union [...] "service orders" [...] (SO, in charge of the demonstrations) was observed, including handing-over of several demonstrators to the police by the trade union's SO. Finally, the CAJ note the disproportion of sentences toward young demonstrators, while others acts of vandalism currently committed by farmers or viticulturists were more lightly punished. It thus alluded to this Alsatian mayor accused of having burned 14 travel trailers but who was condemned only to six months on parole, contrasting with the sentences given to demonstrators (for example, a high school student condemned to 41 days of jail in Fleury-Mérogis because he had burnt two garbage cans before his school).|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to explore the roots of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction, as {{a large body of}} prior quantitative research, spanning more than four decades, indicates that <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> express higher levels of job dissatisfaction than non-union members. Industrial relations scholars {{have not been able to}} agree on an explanation as to why <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> express comparatively more job dissatisfaction. The ambiguity in establishing a causal relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership and job dissatisfaction is due to the fact that previous works have largely been biased towards the use of quantitative methods. The present study, therefore, uses a unique qualitative approach consisting of grounded theoretical techniques and interviews with 43 <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> to gather new insights on the topic. Interviews were conducted at two case study organisations, one a manufacturer and the other a public services organisation, in Scotland. Three alternative explanations that have sought to explain <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction were unpacked. These explanations link <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction to (i) unmet expectations from <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership, (ii) awareness of inequalities and (ii) industrial relations climates. The aim of this dissertation was to develop insights to enable a better understanding of why <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> appear to express dissatisfaction with their jobs. The grounded theoretical approach has enabled at least three contributions to the industrial relations literatures and, to a lesser extent, to the human resources and job satisfaction literatures. These contributions are: (i) a deep, qualitative approach towards understanding the phenomenon; (ii) a critical evaluation of three alternative explanations of the phenomenon; and (iii) insights towards an initial model explaining the roots of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction...|$|R
30|$|The {{opportunities}} to limit collective bargaining outcomes to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members,</b> as described {{with respect to}} vacation entitlements in the Introduction, are limited by law. Closed-shop arrangements, for example, are not allowed and the constitution grants all individuals the right to set up <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> or to abstain from doing so, and declares all steps to obstruct this right as illegal. Additionally, the Non-discrimination Law (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), which implements requirements originating from various European Union directives, explicitly forbids a disadvantageous treatment of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members.</b> By analogy, also a differential treatment of non-members is restricted. In particular, {{it is not possible}} to prohibit firms from extending potentially preferential regulations for <b>members</b> of a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> to non-members.|$|R
