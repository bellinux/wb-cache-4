Two examples are discussed to illustrate how {{the combination of these}} two approaches can significantly enrich the analysis: the "network externality puzzle", which refers to the question of why trading for the same security is often split across trading venues, and the impact of the multi-sided character of financial exchanges on pricing and profitability.

This gives rise to data-driven indirect network effects. We construct a dynamic model of R&D competition, where duopolists repeatedly determine their innovation investments, and show that such <b>markets</b> <b>tip</b> under very mild conditions, moving towards monopoly. In a <b>tipped</b> <b>market,</b> innovation incentives both for the dominant firm and for competitors are small. We also show under which conditions a dominant firm in one market can leverage its position to a connected market, thereby initiating a domino effect. We show that <b>market</b> <b>tipping</b> can be avoided if competitors share their user information...|$|R

40|$|In network industries, {{switching}} costs have two opposite {{effects on the}} tendency towards <b>market</b> <b>tipping.</b> First, the fat-cat effect makes the larger firm price less aggressively and lose consumers to the smaller firm. This effect tends to prevent tipping. Second, the network-solidifying effect reinforces network effects by making a network size advantage longer-lasting and hence more valuable, thus intensifying price competition when networks are of comparable size. This effect tends to cause tipping. I find that when {{switching costs}} are high, the fat-cat effect dominates {{and an increase in}} switching costs can change the <b>market</b> from a <b>tipping</b> equilibrium to a sharing equilibrium. When switching costs are low, the network-solidifying effect dominates and an increase in switching costs can change the market from a sharing equilibrium to a tipping equilibrium.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this M. A. Art Education project is to provide Idaho’s arts {{educators}} with both a comprehensive arts education advocacy handbook and access to a professionally designed arts education advocacy marketing campaign. Global, national, and local arts advocacy research serve {{as a foundation for}} this project. This project has three major components: an arts advocacy handbook, materials for an Idaho-specific arts advocacy marketing campaign, and a social media page. The handbook, “Informed. Active. Connected. Arts Educators Advocating For The Arts in Idaho,” aims to better prepare Idaho’s arts educators to be effective, knowledgeable, and informed advocates for the arts with a consistent marketing message and theme. Major objectives for this project include: accessibility of the handbook and its materials, ease of use, consistent design, and shareability of information. A key component in addressing these intentions is how the handbook will be distributed and accessed. In an effort to maximize viral use and distribution of the arts advocacy handbook, a Facebook Fan Page has been created and serves as a hub for this project. The Facebook Fan Page, “Idaho Arts Advocacy,” will provide Idaho’s arts advocates with an open platform to communicate and connect. The handbook designed {{as a result of this}} project consists of the following information and materials: Introduction: Why An Arts Advocacy Handbook?, Who Is This Handbook For?, How Do You Use This Handbook?, Recent Research In Arts Education, Marketing And Advocacy Defined State of Education in Idaho State of Arts Education in Idaho: Arts Educators vs. Parent Volunteers, Idaho Arts Education Resources, Additional Idaho Resources and Facts, Arts Education Recommendations from NAEA Marketing Plan: Explanation of Design, Posters, Flyers, E-blast, Small Images, Facebook, Additional Ideas, Graphic Design <b>Tips,</b> <b>Marketing</b> <b>Tips</b> Closing: Idaho’s Arts Educators Are Advocates, Resource...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a system dynamics {{model of the}} UK take-up of electric vehicles over the next 40 years. The model extends previous work by Struben and Sterman (2008) to allow analysis of the UK market. The impact on uptake and CO 2 emissions of factors such as subsidies, range, charge point availability, emission rates and a revenue preserving tax are considered. We show that subsidies have little impact on take-up under a traditional business as usual case. However, when we introduce a conditional marketing scenario, they {{play an important role}} in <b>tipping</b> the <b>market</b> into a successful trajectory. The sensitivity of the results to assumptions on word of mouth, average vehicle life and emissions rates are explored and we find that changing these can result in a greater impact on take-up and emissions than policy or vehicle attribute factors.

40|$|We {{examine the}} spatial {{location}} decisions of two competing platforms in a two-sided market. The principle of maximum differentiation {{may fail to}} hold. In particular, when the cross-group network externalities are weak, we obtain maximum horizontal differentiation. For strong network externalities, however, the two platforms locate right {{next to each other}} (minimum differentiation), with one platform dominating the <b>market</b> (<b>tipping).</b> For intermediate network externalities, a location equilibrium in pure strategies does not exist. We then assume that platforms move sequentially. We show that in this case spatial differentiation is asymmetric and intermediate.

40|$|Cellular phone {{carriers}} typically offer complicated nonlinear tariffs. Consumers make {{a discrete}} choice among several rate plans. Each plan has a nonlinear price schedule, and price is usually lower for in-network calls. I present an empirical framework to estimate demand under such nonlinear pricing schemes by using parsimonious data {{and apply the}} estimation method to analyze the cellular phone service market in Taiwan. Based on the estimated model, I evaluate the impacts of termination-based pricing schemes on the market structure. While the existence of in-network discounts causes considerable <b>tipping</b> effects on <b>market</b> shares, the effects come primarily from reducing the average prices, not from the difference between in-network and off-network prices. There is no evidence showing that termination-based pricing by itself has significant effects on market structure. ...|$|R
