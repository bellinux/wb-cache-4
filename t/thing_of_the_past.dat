5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and {{was the leader of}} the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.|$|E

Neither here nor there.” Matsuki {{describes her}} work Blue Ghost thus: [...] "The painting depict some aspects of upper class bourgeois life which was then my environment. The mirror behind the central figure reflects finer <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>The</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting represents <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> center is the present, while the right side and the bottom, the future.

5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training {{but there were a}} total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre is a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, {{two or three}} times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} analysts have {{suggested}} that WASP dominance of the institutional order has become a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The accepted wisdom is that after World War II, the selection of individuals for leadership positions was increasingly based on factors such as motivation and training rather than ethnicity and social lineage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 60s, annexing {{just a small}} portion of a {{neighboring}} county became largely a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> In order {{to meet the needs of}} their growing populations, some cities and counties throughout Virginia began to merge entirely (through the consolidation process enabled by the 1960 Virginia General Assembly).|$|E

25|$|Although {{the problem}} of hard drugs in Dublin had been {{controlled}} somewhat, prior to the 2008 recession, through methadone programmes for addicts and better economic prospects for young people, {{it is by no}} means a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> As of 2011, heroin addiction and homelessness are huge problems across the inner city of Dublin.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of United States in 1952 and Cunard's {{decision}} not to challenge the new record the Blue Riband contest again subsided.

25|$|The {{automatic}} flap system's suitability for cross-country flying {{has also}} been tested successfully in a specially modified Rolladen-Schneider LS3 high-performance competition glider. A high degree of reliability is achieved due to there being no electrical or electronic components in the automatic flap system.

25|$|The library {{seems to}} have {{continued}} in existence to some degree until its contents were largely lost during the taking of the city by the Emperor Aurelian (AD 270–275), who was suppressing a revolt by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra.

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} {{to the early}} 1990s, KOFY also {{featured}} an in-studio, live kids cartoon show called Cartoon Classics. Hosted by Maestro Dick Bright, the show offered such cartoons as Mighty Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry and Popeye. The show frequently featured local magician Magic Mike (played by Michael Stroud) performing for the studio children. Finally the live-action in-studio segment was scrapped and the show just showed the cartoons straight. Afternoon cartoon shows such as these eventually became a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> as cable television was able to feature round-the-clock cartoons aimed at younger viewers.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 1900s, after Mexico {{started to}} {{industrialize}} and modernize, {{the consumption of}} pulque and the popularity of pulquerias had greatly declined.

As factories established themselves and migrant workers started to come into Mexico, the beer industry greatly expand and beer soon replaced pulque as the alcoholic drink of choice. The popularity of pulquerias declined as they were seen as a <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> By the 1930s, there was a steep reduction in the number of pulquerias in Mexico City, and today there are very few of them left.|$|E
