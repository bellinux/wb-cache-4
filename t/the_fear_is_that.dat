25|$|Political parties universally tend {{to attract}} those {{addicted}} to fame and careerism.... Clearly, the biggest barrier to green electoral victory {{is the lack}} of proportional representation. Greens have been elected around the world in countries with PR.... <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a leader will shift the party to the right, cutting the Greens' radical edge....|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} a single leader would {{compromise}} the party's commitment to radical democracy. It also suggests a failure to think about strategy in any real sense. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{could be part of}} a more extensive shift towards a new green politics of shallow environmentalism, rather than a thorough critique of an unequal, profit-motivated society.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{involved}} in polyamorous relationships often {{keep it a}} secret because of the risk that it will be used by an ex-spouse, or other family member, as grounds to deprive them of custody of or access to their children. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it will be used in family disputes much as homosexuality has been used in the past.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{there would}} <b>be</b> a chain {{reaction}} as the company liquidated its securities to cover its debt, leading to a drop in prices, which would force other companies to liquidate their own debt creating a vicious cycle.|$|R
50|$|Binns {{was summoned}} to Washington by Thomas O. Enders.I was told to stop human rights {{reporting}} except in back channel. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if it came into the State Department, it will leak, Binns recalled. They wanted to keep assistance flowing. Increased violations by the Honduran military would prejudice that.|$|R
50|$|Against the norms, the {{authorities}} of the Province then assigned {{him to the}} friary in his hometown. This was contrary to the norms, because <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> young friars would find themselves distracted by family and friends, thereby stunting their spiritual growth. Yet the level of his detachment <b>was</b> so great <b>that</b> they felt <b>that</b> this <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> largely unwarranted in his case.|$|R
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points, so <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E
25|$|Many of the world's countries, {{including}} many in Sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia, {{have seen a}} sharp rise in population {{since the end of}} the Cold War. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc.; in some of the less fortunate countries. The population of Chad has, for example, ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009, further straining its resources. Nigeria is witnessing a similar growth in population, strained resources and a possible over-population problem in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|Intense Western {{diplomatic}} {{pressure was}} also being exerted on Abdullah Abdullah {{to cut a}} deal. According to The Telegraph, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if Karzai defies Washington and appoints his own choice of allies to key ministerial roles, he would be more [...] "difficult for the West to influence".|$|E
50|$|The {{plan was}} {{intended}} {{both as a}} political manifestation {{of the influence of}} Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> aftermath of the war the allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It <b>was</b> clear <b>that</b> Poland would <b>be</b> liberated by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile.|$|R
50|$|However, since 31 of the signatories were Huguenots, {{and because}} the Netherlands was at war with France, the {{rejected}} petition generated belated concern in Amsterdam. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> discontent might convince some to become spies for the French. The VOC dismissed van der Stel, and ordered {{his return to the}} Netherlands (23 April 1707). VOC officials were subsequently forbidden to own any land at the Cape of Good Hope.|$|R
50|$|The major {{glass bottle}} company Based in Fensmark Is {{the largest private}} {{employer}} in the municipality with about 400 employees manufacturing bottles for soft drinks and beers among its most common products. It {{is part of the}} Irish Ardagh Group and until recently <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> factory would be closed due to economic issues <b>that</b> today have <b>been</b> resolved and the factory is doing well again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: [...] "The [...] {{people want}} to stop {{enrichment}} but the government doesn't listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am {{not a member of}} the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if they do, Israel will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [...] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, {{as in the}} {{writings}} of Leon Kass, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed. In his 2002 book Our Posthuman Future and in a 2004 Foreign Policy magazine article, political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism as the world's most dangerous idea because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy (in general) and liberal democracy (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of [...] "human nature". Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his 2003 book The Future of Human Nature, in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another's unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human [...] "species ethic" [...] would be undermined by embryo-stage genetic alteration. Critics such as Kass, Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the social order. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the [...] "naturalizing" [...] of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes. AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Marvin Minsky and Hans Moravec, which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.|$|E
5000|$|By mid-1964 the {{situation}} in Southeast Asia was ambiguous. North Vietnam was determined to take over South Vietnam. Communist rebel forces were making military and political gains in Laos. The United States was taking {{over the role of}} [...] "protector" [...] from France in the area and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> communism would prevail over the democratic governments in the region. However, there was no real justification for a full-scale American military involvement in the region.|$|R
50|$|The highly {{religious}} and conservative Abadiano family also dealt extensively {{in books and}} pamphlets related to the Church in Mexico. During the secular reforms of 1857 through 1861, many of the books and manuscripts of the libraries of Mexico City convents were transferred to the Abadianos or purchased by them and held in trust {{with the intent of}} restoring them at a future date. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would <b>be</b> appropriated or destroyed by the government.|$|R
60|$|A mantle was {{stretched}} across it, {{so that no}} glimmer of light should warn <b>the</b> new-comer. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he might have heard, the sound of Nigel's descent. But soon it <b>was</b> clear <b>that</b> he had not done so, for Andreas announced <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> still advancing. Presently Nigel could hear the distant thud of his feet. If he bore a lantern all was lost. But no gleam of light appeared in the black tunnel, and still the footsteps drew nearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "We need fear no civil war," [...] {{the rabbi}} said. [...] "The {{people of all}} Galilee, save the violent and ill {{disposed}} in {{a few of the}} towns, are all for Josephus. If it comes to force, John and his party know that they will be swept away, like a straw before the wind. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they may succeed in murdering Josephus; either by the knife of an assassin, or in one of these tumults. They would rather the latter, because they would then say that the people had torn him to pieces, in their fury at his misdoings.|$|E
60|$|Italy {{ought not}} to draw you just now, Fanny. We are all looking for war, and {{wondering}} where the safety is. A Piccolomini said yesterday that it was as safe at Rome as in Florence, which only proved Florence unsafe. Austria may come down on Central Italy any day; {{and sooner or later}} there must be war. The Storys are alarmed enough to avoid going back to Rome until the end of November, when things may be a little arranged. The indignation here is great against 'questa canaglia di Germania.' Toeplitz means mischief both against France and Italy--that is plain. The Prince of Prussia gave his 'parole de gentilhomme' meaning the word of a rascal. My poor Venice! But you will see presently, only <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our fire here may flash very far. In any case, it would not be desirable for Englishmen to come southwards this year. Our plans for the winter depend entirely on circumstances. If we can go to Rome in any reasonable security, I suppose we shall go. But I have no heart for plans just now.|$|E

50|$|In late 2013, {{there was}} some {{controversy}} when it <b>was</b> announced <b>that</b> Marstons would sell some 200 pubs to new company New River Retail. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many would close and be turned into convenience stores. In 2014, the company took over production of most Thwaites beers after {{the closure of the}} latter's main brewery. On 31 March 2015, it was announced the company was buying the bulk of Thwaites beer supply business outright and the top two brands Wainwright and Lancaster Bomber for around £25m.|$|R
25|$|In the 1840s {{the major}} {{challenge}} for the Catholic Church was keeping the loyalty of the very poor Catholic arrivals during marches. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelicalization. In response the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet the need and keep people inside the faith. The Catholic church was less successful in dealing with tensions between its French and the Irish clergy; eventually the Irish took control.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007, Advanced Medical Optics, {{manufacturer}} of Complete Moisture Plus Contact Lens Solution products, issued a voluntary recall of their Complete Moisture Plus solutions. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> contact lens wearers who used their solution were {{at higher risk}} of acanthamoebic keratitis than contact lens wearers who used other solutions. The manufacturer recalled the product after the Centers for Disease Control in the United States found that 21 individuals had possibly received an Acanthamoeba infection after using Complete Moisture Plus in the month prior to diagnosis....|$|R

5000|$|The {{partnership}} between Beacon and The Huffington Post was criticised for allowing a for-profit corporation seek and accept funding for donations {{that are usually}} reserved for non-profit entities. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it may be easier to crowdfund journalist salaries than expending corporate profits.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} start of the war with France, Monke sailed Speedwell to Hamburg to {{retrieve}} some British sailors rescued from various vessels that had wrecked on the coast of Jutland. He brought back about 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was bad, to forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sailors, who were not anxious to be pressed into the Royal Navy, would try to seize Speedwell and run her ashore.|$|R
50|$|It was on William's {{advice that}} Charles sent his brother Ferdinand away from Spain. Ferdinand was loved {{by the people}} and Spanish-born, while Charles was distrusted as a foreigner. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Ferdinand might <b>be</b> used as a figurehead for a revolt. He {{arranged}} for his namesake twenty-year-old nephew to be appointed Archbishop of Toledo. He was thus able to enjoy the immense revenues the see generated from afar. This appointment landed Charles in trouble later, as the appointment of an unqualified young foreigner offended the sensibilities of the Spanish and helped provoke the Revolt of the Comuneros.|$|R
50|$|The third-sex, {{known as}} napuṃsakas, were an {{important}} consideration {{because there was a}} social stigma attached to them. As Zwilling and Sweet explain, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> broader populace would assume things wrongly of Jain mendicants if the napuṃsakas were ordained as monks or even if mendicants accepted alms from them. Thus, another reason why it was important to determine who {{was a part of the}} third-sex was to enforce monastic conduct and public opinion. However, over time, this ban grew lax, especially if third-sex people were especially well-connected to local people or they were seen as being especially able to control their sexuality.|$|R

5000|$|This {{could be}} set up to prevent Canada’s {{remaining}} nine provinces from being split into two non-contiguous chunks of territory separated by about 300 mi of foreign (Quebec) soil. The term sometimes used for this eventuality is [...] "Pakistanisation", {{in reference to the}} way in which East Pakistan and West Pakistan were separated by hundreds of miles of foreign soil, following independence in 1947, with East Pakistan eventually separating and becoming its own country, Bangladesh, in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Canada would be unworkable if its four Atlantic provinces were to become an exclave.|$|E

"It is {{a capital}} idea, Marjory," [...] Archie said, [...] "and will assuredly succeed if any plan can do so. <b>The</b> only <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> search {{will be so}} hot in the morning that the {{soldiers}} may even insist upon looking into the coffin." ...|$|R

5000|$|Historical {{references}} to colonial America and eighteenth-century England, {{the fantasy of}} a feminist utopia, and the woman's role in colonialism and religious conversion {{are just a few}} of the components of this narrative. One of the criticisms that accompanied its publication in 1767 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> female readers might possibly partake in similar adventures, thus questioning their lives and limitations. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virtue of the women of this period would be potentially endangered. In order to assuage such concerns, the introduction emphasizes <b>that</b> the story <b>is</b> not only [...] "pleasing and instructive" [...] but [...] "fit to be perused by the youth of both sexes, as a rational, moral entertainment." ...|$|R
