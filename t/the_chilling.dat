When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest.

5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for <b>the</b> <b>chilling</b> water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground to stay out of <b>the</b> <b>chilling</b> wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E
40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{in countries like}} India vary throughout the year. The summer will be {{three to four months}} with varying temperatures, depending on the location.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{substitution}} of air condensation by water condensation in <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> of a university building.

In this paper, the novelty lies in the cooling system of the condensation water, since the typical cooling tower {{is not going to be}} considered; instead, the domestic cold water consumed in the building would be used to cool <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> condensing water. As the domestic water consumption in the building is neither constant nor coincident with the cooling requirements of <b>the</b> <b>chiller,</b> <b>the</b> use of the fire water tank as heat storage was proposed. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is cooled by the water contained in the fire tank and this fire water is then cooled by the domestic water. With this solution, the reduction in the annual energy consumption of <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is around 18. 6...|$|R
