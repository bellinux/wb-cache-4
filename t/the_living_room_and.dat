As Marge returns home later that night, Homer surprises her by hiding all their friends in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> declares {{that he wants}} to be remarried, this time with a perfect wedding. The two are remarried. Meanwhile, Kirk decides to try to get back together with Luann by singing her a song from his demo tape but is rejected.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, he goes to <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens {{the next morning and}} is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Summertime {{temperatures}} in UK homes are {{a matter of}} increasing concern, particularly because of global warming and an increased incidence of heat waves. Refurbishment adds to uncertainty about the resilience of UK homes to climate change. This paper examines internal summertime temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and bedrooms of 282 homes in the UK city of Leicester. This is a statistically representative sample of the city’s housing stock. The generally cool monitoring period included {{a short period of}} hot weather. Occupant behaviour {{had a significant impact on}} internal temperature, 13 % of the homes were actively heated even during the spell of hot weather. In the 230 unheated homes, 28 % of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> 88 % of bedrooms were classed as severely overheated, as judged by the static, CIBSE, criteria. In contrast, 64 % of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> 71 % of the bedrooms were judged uncomfortably cool as defined by the BSEN 15251 Cat II adaptive thermal comfort standard...|$|R
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|The house {{features}} a tower {{where he could}} relax and read newspapers. His wife Augusta sometimes slept on the porch on hot summer days beneath its copper roof. Several windows in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> vestibule were made from stained glass.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> when she heard no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over in his chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
50|$|The Schliersee museum (built around 1500) {{shows the}} rural {{life and work}} over the past 500 years {{in one of the}} oldest houses in the village. In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> bedrooms, an open Rauchkuchel, a court and a prison can be seen. The collection includes furniture and miscellaneous items and a collection of glass objects from the Schliersee glass works.|$|R
3000|$|Six {{homes were}} {{investigated}} in Mari village. Averages of C x [...] for <b>the</b> bedrooms, <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kitchen spaces ranged between 26 and 76  Bq m− 3 (average 39  Bq m− 3), 30 – 56  Bq m− 3 (average 32  Bq m− 3), and 29 – 60  Bq m− 3 (average 36  Bq m− 3) respectively. The variance ranged between 0.03 and 0.04, 0.03 and 0.07, and 0.04 and 0.05 for <b>the</b> bedrooms, <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> kitchen spaces, respectively. Qlaiaa and Mari produced C x [...] values that {{were close to}} each other as well as a homogenous distribution of Rn concentration among the rooms of each dwelling. These two villages lie on different geological formations: Mari is built on basaltic rock layers whereas Qlaiaa is not. The close level of Rn concentration between the two villages might be {{due to the fact that}} they use the same common building materials.|$|R

25|$|One day, the {{landlord}} leaves his overcoat in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{in the pocket}} of the overcoat is the key to Xi'er's cell. Zhang Ershen is determined to help Xi'er. She takes the key and opens the door for Xi'er, and she flees. Shortly, {{the landlord}} finds Xi'er missing, and sends his accomplice, Mu Renzhi, and other men to chase her. Xi'er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters were {{immediately}} alerted {{due to a}} natural gas explosion and fire in a Scottsdale house. It ripped through the home in the 2000 block of North 74th Place at 8:42am. It appeared to be centered in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent fire burned the house to rubble. The initial explosion {{was strong enough to}} collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for a half-mile (800 m) in all directions. Firefighters kept the -high blaze from spreading to neighboring houses. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E
25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

50|$|In June 2008, {{after several}} months of writing and pre-production, Garth and Miller {{traveled}} to Eugene, OR, met with sound engineer Mike “Lazer” Lavin, and the band entered Gung-Ho Studio. Gung-Ho provided the duo with access to high-end studio equipment, vintage instruments, and a change of environment from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> storage sheds. Garth would later recall, “Most of the record was recorded in Eugene, Oregon, to have that rainy influence” which helped give the album a “more psychedelic-y” sound.|$|R
50|$|The Palazzo, {{overlooking}} the Piazza Colonna and the Via del Corso, was begun in 1562 by Giacomo della Porta and completed by Carlo Maderno in 1580 for the Aldobrandini family.

500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family back into <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world {{was coming to an end}} and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven".

500|$|The Ellwood House {{living room}} {{did not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The {{original}} living room space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In the living room, a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's living room was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> sunroom. The living room was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The living room features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme. The large, Caen stone [...] fireplace was carved in Chicago in 1911. The sunroom was designed in the late 19th century and early 20th century Arts and Crafts style causing it to stand {{in stark contrast to}} the living room. The room was originally furnished with Mission style furniture to complement the oak woodwork.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s, Eric showed {{leadership}} in the international effort to assist physicists (mainly Jewish) in the Soviet Union who had been fired from their positions in leading research institutes and universities and denied access to research facilities. Notable among these was the eminent physicist, Andrei Sakharov. He and other physicists from the West helped these [...] "refuseniks" [...] to keep up in current research by organizing seminars in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> kitchens of cramped apartments in Moscow. KGB agents were all around and Eric later admitted he was often fearful for his own safety.|$|R
500|$|In the video, Rihanna plays Casta's lesbian love interest. Casta {{arrives at}} the castle in a car, and steps out with a very provocative dominatrix-looking outfit, and meets Rihanna who is waiting inside. Throughout all of the video, Casta tries to seduce Rihanna whilst Rihanna {{initially}} resists, but eventually gives in to Casta's charm. First, she meets Rihanna in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> catches her eye. In the next scene, the couple are shown {{on top of a}} table with ultraviolet lighting and Casta rubs her head on Rihanna's legs. They are then shown outside the castle and Rihanna falls to the ground in despair while Casta looks on, letting her long hair fall loose and standing seductively. Soon, they are shown {{in a room full of}} male dancers and Rihanna begins to feel more comfortable around her admirer. The last two scenes are Rihanna and Casta in PVC bondage outfits kissing and caressing on a bed in a darkened room, and then at a burning table, looking away from each other. Billboards music video reviewer, Monica Herrera commented, [...] "Rihanna saved a far sexier clip than 'Rockstar 101' for fans abroad."

On Marge's advice, Ms. Botz puts Maggie to bed and has Bart and Lisa watch The Happy Little Elves. When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing, Ms. Botz quickly puts him in his place because she has dealt with troublesome children like him before. After Ms. Botz leaves the room Bart tunes into a station airing America's Most Armed and Dangerous (a parody of America's Most Wanted), which profiles a wanted burglar nicknamed [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] A mug shot of the suspect shows Bart and Lisa that Ms. Botz is [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] Ms. Botz enters <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> realizes that her cover has been blown.
