5|$|Ueshiba's senior {{students}} have {{different approaches to}} aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found {{all over the world}} in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis.

5|$|Back at the Alley, Sing {{undergoes}} a transformation {{brought on by}} the Beast's attack, fully healing himself and making him a kung-fu master himself. He sees to <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Landlords as the Gang arrives. Sing easily defeats the Gang and faces the Beast alone. The Beast uses his Toad style maneuvers to launch Sing high into the air. While aloft, Sing comes to peace with Buddha, and is able to use the Buddhist Palm method to subdue the Beast. The Beast accepts his defeat and asks Sing to be his master.|$|E

The central research hypothesis assumed <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a predictive association of family support and social interaction with <b>the</b> personal <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly. We studied information from 952 individuals ranging in age from 65 to 100 years, were built summations of instrumental support, economic, emotional, and a range of social relations and other staff to examine <b>well-being</b> information. <b>The</b> regression results indicate a positive predictor of emotional support and social interaction with <b>the</b> personal <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly. The instrumental and economic support) are not associated with <b>the</b> personal <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly in Monterrey, and does not appear any significant predictive relationship between two variables...|$|R

5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic was not {{prepared}} to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E
5|$|The Sandomierz {{articles}} {{produced by}} the rebels were concerned mostly with placing further limitations on the monarch's power. Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed {{out of it and}} demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's position would remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. Whatever was left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution to the crisis of authority was arrived at. But the victorious lords of the council had at their disposal no effective political machinery necessary to propagate <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, still in its Golden Age (or as some prefer Silver Age now), much further.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but for <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{construct}} of nature connectedness is {{also related to}} a branch of psychology called ecopsychology.

25|$|Malthus {{criticized the}} Poor Laws for leading to {{inflation}} rather than improving <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor. He supported taxes on grain imports (the Corn Laws), because food security {{was more important}} than maximizing wealth. His views became influential, and controversial, across economic, political, social and scientific thought. Pioneers of evolutionary biology read him, notably Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. He remains a much-debated writer.|$|E

25|$|Anxiety {{over the}} {{availability}} of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores.

The military refuse to allow in basic medicines, so that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing a break out, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting upon food delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans {{is the level of}} algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food chain.|$|E
