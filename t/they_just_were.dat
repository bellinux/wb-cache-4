For most, they did not {{view it as a}} weird concept to explain to their kids, especially at a young age, because none of the politics had to go into their explanation, they could simply state the facts and the children were accepting of that. For example, the common explanation to their children was that they were “born with a girl body but a boy heart.” In addition, they still felt as though they were their child’s mother because biologically, they were, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>were</b> no longer a mother figure. However, most of them were still being referred to by their child as “mom”.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{formed in}} 1967 after a chance {{encounter}} between the group members at a convenience store, with a line-up {{that consisted of}} Louis Shriner (lead guitar, vocals), Dave Tempelton (drums), Dennis Roller (rhythm guitar), and Steve Kuppinger (bass guitar, vocals). A decision to name the group the Graveyard Five was made when the bandmates experienced an apparent supernatural encounter with the dead, while playing with an ouija board. The unaccounted [...] "fifth member" [...] of the Graveyard Five was a coffin that the group would ceremoniously carry onto the stage prior to performances. Combine with their elaborate light show, the band developed a dark presence in their live performances, with a repertoire that originally contained surf rock-inspired instrumentals. Kuppinger recalled the Graveyard Five's rise to popularity was met with challenges, noting the struggles of performing at [...] "bars where <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>were</b> not ready for us. We had fights {{on the stage and}} had beer bottles thrown at us while we played. It was some really hard work for very little pay".|$|E

5000|$|It was {{scheduled}} that Regazzoni, Ickx, Ignazio Giunti, Peter Schetty, Nino Vaccarella and Arturo Merzario should race as many rounds as possible. Only Vaccarella and Schetty were free from F1 obligations. Although fast, {{they were not}} such typical all-rounders as Jo Siffert, Brian Redman, Vic Elford, Hans Herrmann and Pedro Rodriguez (of them Siffert raced in F1 for March and Rodriguez raced F1 for BRM, but had not the same heavy testing duties as most other F1 racers), who all could drive, for example, the ultra-fast Spa-Francorchamps in a 917K just as competently as they could drive the twisty, winding Targa Florio course in a 908/03. Ferrari only entered one car in the Targa Florio, driven by Giunti and Vaccarella, whereas Porsche entered 4 cars in the event and won it easily. Although all of the Ferrari drivers were just as capable, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>were</b> not as available as the Porsche drivers. Vaccarella was [...] "the man of the rocky mountains" [...] at the Targa Florio and Schetty was the specialist of hillclimbing racing were Porsche was also a dominant factor. Unfortunately, Derek Bell and Jackie Oliver were also unavailable at most endurance races, since they drove F1 for Brabham and BRM. John Surtees, who had quit Ferrari in 1966 after an argument with Eugenio Dragoni, returned for the races in Monza, Spa and at the Nürburgring.|$|E
5000|$|Love, {{on various}} occasions, has stated her {{disappointment}} with the album. She demonstrated her extreme regret about {{the record in}} a September 2006 interview:"The sound on America's Sweetheart sucked beyond words. The production was a nightmare. Linda and I had written some really good songs, but they were rendered lazily and sound like shit. The art was horrific and not my idea and the label didn't back it at all. I was busy taking drugs to dull the pain of having lost everything and made a shit album to boot ... the producer didn't {{know what he was}} doing and he just spent my money. It almost had a moment of being Exile on Main Street - almost - but that's like almost winning a race. You either do or you do not. And in this case it's a delightfully written record in parts and sonically untenable with two of the most pretentious songs I have ever written. I was so druggy I thought it'd be cute to rip off [...] "(Smells Like) Teen Spirit" [...] on [...] "I'll Do Anything." [...] Believe it or not, [...] "All the Drugs", [...] "Sunset Strip", [...] "Mono" [...] and [...] "But Julian..." [...] are all good songs. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>were</b> produced crap and the songs weren't taken further than demo status. The art still makes me seethe. At least make it look cool, and instead there's me as a Playboy pinup. I love Olivia's art but that was personal for me - not art for a record." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis deals with {{everyday}} life in Podblanicko Region during the socialist era. This is a local research that tries to show the memories of rural people on the period of normalization, defined by the 70 s and 80 s of the 20 th century, in terms of food, clothing and housing. The research deals with the strategies, tactics and improvisations of the inhabitants of this region {{in the period of}} socialism, among other things focused on the lack of required goods in shops, poor supply, searching for not very high-quality construction materials and fashionable clothes. Apart from individual expressions, it deals with community style that inherently belongs to the rural population. The era of socialism is strongly ingrained {{in the mind of the}} people who lived at that time. It is clear from many sources that before the year 1989 people in the countryside did not live just meaningless lives, remarked and emptied by a totalitarian regime. In many cases, they tried to ignore the regime or <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>were</b> not interested in it. In their everyday life they created values, which were more important to them.
