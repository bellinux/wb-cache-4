5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E

Material from <b>The</b> <b>Cry</b> of Love was re-released in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun, along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include.|$|E

40|$|Can adults {{attribute}} {{different meanings}} to <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> produced by <b>the</b> newborns {{on the basis}} of physical-acoustic cues in different communication conditions? In order to test this hypothesis, 20 females were asked to evaluate (according to four scales: anguish, anger, annoyance, care-seeking) 24 cries from 12 healthy full-term newborns (4 - 7 h old) : 6 newborns previously exposed to tactile communication (Group 1); 6 newborns without communication (Group 2). Annoyance category was not reliable and it was excluded from analyses. The 20 females attributed a higher rate of anger and anguish to <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> from Group 2, and a higher rate of care-seeking to <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> from Group 1. They attributed different meanings to <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> from Group 1, and undifferentiated meanings to <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> from Group 2. Consistent with bivariate analyses, Dysphonic <b>Cry</b> was <b>the</b> strongest predictor of anger/anguish. Although <b>the</b> Hyperphonic <b>Cry</b> was quantitatively not relevant, its absence was the first predictor for care-seeking...|$|R
