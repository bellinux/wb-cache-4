40|$|Two {{types of}} {{measures}} {{are used to}} find how much information can be transferred between the runoff series along the river and how much information the linear and non- linear (power- function non- linearity) regression analyses actually transfer. In the former case the relative measures of transferability {{are based on the}} entropy theory, and in the latter case the classical correlation coefficients for measuring the <b>transferred</b> <b>information</b> among the river flows are used. The Esencay River basin in Turkey is used as a demonstration case of complex composition of karstic and non- karstic formations feeding water to a river. It was found that the non- linear correlation always transfers more information than the linear correlation. The transferable information is nearly always greater than the <b>transferred</b> <b>information</b> of non- linear case, especially in summer/fall months of flow recession. Due to differences in responses of karstified and non- karstic subbasins to precipitation, it is likely that a search for the other non- linear relationships {{and the use of the}} multiple lag cross correlation and regression analysis, would significantly reduce the differences between the transferable and actually <b>transferred</b> <b>information.</b> The correlation and regression analysi...|$|E

We perform experiments in simulation and with real robots. Furthermore, we show that the same explicit <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> strategies can also be applied to another collective behavior: collective transport with obstacle avoidance. In implicit <b>information</b> <b>transfer,</b> directional <b>information</b> is <b>transferred</b> without communication. We show that a simple motion control method is sufficient to guarantee cohesive and aligned motion without resorting to communication or elaborate sensing. We analyze the motion control method for its capability to achieve flocking with and without a desired direction of motion, both in simulation and using real robots. Furthermore, to better understand its underlying mechanism, we study this method using tools of statistical physics, showing that the process can be explained in terms of non-linear elasticity and energy-cascading dynamics.
