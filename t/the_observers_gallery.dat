40|$|Developed for the OUR MACHINES {{exhibition}} at <b>the</b> <b>Observer</b> Building Hastings, 13 February to 14 March 2016, ‘Screen Machine’ offered public audience participants {{the opportunity to}} co-create chance encounters and self-direct spontaneous performances between two separate installation locations. These unique transitory events relied entirely on the roles and performances the participants brought to these telepresent screens and the experiences they chose to live out. Inspired by our urban and cultural surroundings and re-contextualized in a diverse array of digital milieus, ‘Screen Machine’ aimed to allow these public audiences the agency and control over the outcomes of this intervention, akin to a telepresent fluxus happening.   The installation takes live oblique camera shots from above the screens of two separate audience groups located in <b>the</b> <b>Observer</b> Building <b>Gallery</b> situated on green and blue screen backdrops. Linked via a live video connection the audiences are brought together on screen using a system of chroma-key video mixers. As the merged audiences start to explore this collaborative, shared telepresent space they discover the ground beneath them, as it appears on screen, locates them {{in a world of}} surprising and intriguing anamorphic environments. These digital backgrounds directly reference our social and cultural setting in a ludic virtual world. This installation adopts a playful and open approach to public video screens to manifest a truly interactive peoples screen. Inspired in part by 3 D anamorphic street art and computer games, the motivation behind this proposal also comes from the historic films of Lumière contemporaries Mitchell and Kenyon, whose films of Edwardian public crowds in the 1900 ’s present a striking similarity to the way audiences react and respond in Sermon and Gould’s telematic urban screen interventions...|$|R

In DORIS, the ground station emits the signal and the satellite receives.|$|R

25|$|Consider {{the case}} of an {{observer}} and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to <b>the</b> <b>observer.</b> At <b>the</b> moment of emission, the beam in <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> <b>the</b> light source moves in <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> frame, and <b>the</b> 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in <b>the</b> <b>observer's</b> frame at <b>the</b> moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect.

5000|$|When {{the source}} of the waves is moving towards <b>the</b> <b>observer,</b> each {{successive}} wave crest is emitted from a position closer to <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> than <b>the</b> previous wave.

Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are travelling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves [...] "bunch together". Conversely, if {{the source of}} waves is moving away from <b>the</b> <b>observer,</b> each wave is emitted from a position farther from <b>the</b> <b>observer</b> than <b>the</b> previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency.
