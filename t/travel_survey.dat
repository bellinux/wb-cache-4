Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Travel</b> <b>surveys</b> are the foundation of traffic predictions. From <b>travel</b> <b>surveys,</b> the general public's traveling characteristics are obtained. The traveling characteristics of people allow transportation planners, through computer modeling, to predict the traffic on street networks. One problem with <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> is missing trips. <b>Travel</b> <b>surveys</b> do not account for all trips. This thesis presents the results of a study comparing household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> with workplace <b>travel</b> <b>surveys.</b> The objective for the study was to find where trips are missed in household and workplace <b>travel</b> <b>surveys.</b> By finding the differences between the trip rates of the two surveys, missing trips were found. Trips are missed because people do not remember all of their trips. This thesis tries to account for the missing trips by comparing the trip rates of workers found in the two different surveys, household and workplace. Trip rates were found for all trip types-home based work (HBW), home based non-work (HBNW), and non-home based (NHB) trips. The thesis concluded that people remember more non-work trips associated with the place or location of the survey. If a person is at work, he will remember more non-work trips associated with work. If at home, a person will remember more non-work trips associated with the home...|$|R

However, with rising costs of many surveys, and the critical need for good quality data, how best to obtain a quality survey that also provides comparable data to other household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys,</b> is a question that constantly arises. The National Cooperative Highway Research Program sponsored a research project to develop and recommend standards for household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys.</b> The purpose of this research is to assist in maintaining a minimum standard of quality in household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> and thus lead to greater comparability across surveys. This paper reviews t he state of practice with respect to specifying standards for surveys in general. Standards for household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> are found to be non-existent, while those for any type of social survey are found to be uncommon, and deal with only a few aspects of surveys. In this research effort, over sixty possible areas for standards have been identified, of which forty one were investigated. A number of proposed standards are outlined, including details of the analysis that, in some cases, has aided the development of the proposals. These proposals have been developed in the North American context, but may also offer potential for other countries, especially in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Also, the standards are intended to be helpful to those who are responsible for developing requests for proposals to undertake household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys,</b> but who lack the level of knowledge and experience to be certain what to request...|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{accidental}} death per hour spent using the roads in Hong Kong is about 11 times the average risk per {{hour in the}} rest of everyday life. Other kinds of travel also have risks. Changes in travel patterns affect the numbers of people killed and injured in transport accidents. This means that all policies that affect travel patterns also affect the numbers killed and injured in transport accidents, and conversely, changing travel patterns may itself be a way of reducing these numbers. Investigation of these interactions between travel patterns and amount of death and injury in transport accidents can benefit greatly from various kinds of data that are already commonly collected in <b>travel</b> <b>surveys.</b> But the range of such investigations could be extended in useful ways if some additional items of data could be collected in <b>travel</b> <b>surveys.</b> There is also scope for the methods used in <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> to be extended in new ways to improve understanding of the occurrence of transport accidents and people’s involvement in them by supplementing with <b>surveys</b> akin to <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> the data that are recorded when accidents occur...|$|R

40|$|Eight cities walking: {{comparative}} data on walking as a transport mode from cities in Europe, Australia and the US, Portland Werner Brg, Nicola Mense When it is mentioned {{that people are}} more mobile these days, it is often thought of as motor-ized transportation. Additionally, in nearly all cities in the world, car usage is increasing {{at the expense of}} walking. It is now time to stop this development and put more emphasis on walk-ing. Walking is the most common movement in urban transport, nearly everyone is a pedestrian for part of their trips even if they are driving or using a bus or rail transit. Walking as a means of transport is often overlooked and many <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> do not even measure walking. In a number of cities {{in different parts of the}} world, and now including Portland US, Social-data has conducted household <b>travel</b> <b>surveys</b> to collect data for all modes of transportation, including walking and cycling. The ÒNEW Kontiv DesignÓ was developed in response to the insufficient representation of non-motorized ways of travelling, and to demonstrate the value of walking for mobility rather than being under-estimated for transport and town planning.

The developed framework employs mathematical and statistical methods to derive probability density functions and multinomial logit models for activity and location choices. The implementation of demand estimation process resulted into the creation of 1, 200, 889 agents (only those using cars). The scenario for the estimated agents was configured and simulated in MATSim. The results from the simulated scenario resulted in the expected morning, afternoon and evening traffic patterns {{as well as the}} desirable level of agreement between simulated and observed traffic volumes...|$|R
