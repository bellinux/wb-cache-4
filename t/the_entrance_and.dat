5|$|Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan {{what his}} {{intentions}} are, {{and does not}} like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> sets the barn on fire, but he cannot {{go through with it}} and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between father and son. Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Will claims he accidentally started the fire by dropping his cigar.|$|E
50|$|On {{either side}} of <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> <b>and</b> towers are five double-hung windows on each floor, with wall dormers over two bays. The corners have narrow, {{windowless}} turrets. <b>The</b> <b>entrance</b> bay, dormer, <b>and</b> flanking towers project from the building.|$|R

5|$|In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Annabeth and Percy find an {{entrance}} into the Labyrinth during a game of capture the flag. Percy soon learns that Luke had used <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> will lead his army through the Labyrinth straight in {{to the heart of}} camp. To get into the Labyrinth, Percy has to find the symbol of Daedalus, the Greek letter delta, (Δ) on a passageway, touch it, and then enter the Labyrinth. Using the Labyrinth, Percy tries to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} another fruitless {{sweep of}} the North Sea in late December and, while trying to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, Monarch was accidentally rammed by Conqueror on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building {{at the top of}} the hill next to The Woodman public house with a pair of escalators between <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure down the side of the cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, escalator was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit {{at the top of the}} cutting.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> <b>and</b> see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria {{blew out}} a window of the {{monument}}. In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar the monument. The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> <b>and</b> Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E

5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's entrance, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> is {{shredded}} by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> <b>and</b> some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|Opposite <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> <b>and</b> {{running across}} {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2000 season, Six Flags New England {{was known}} as Riverside Park. Six Flags {{purchased}} the park and added their own DC Comics theming. The site that Superman the Ride operates on is the former site of the Riverside Park Speedway. The Speedway was demolished after the 1999 season {{to make room for}} a new themed area, DC Superhero Adventure. As part of the $40 million expansion, the park built Superman: Ride of Steel. Six Flags worked with Swiss manufacturer, Intamin, to build and design the ride a year earlier. The final track piece of Superman was installed on March 27, 2000, about 40 days before opening day. The ride officially opened on May 5, 2000 as the tallest and longest roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States. <b>The</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> station were themed to Superman with Superman logos and a picture of him located above the entrance. The second tunnel also had a mist effect.|$|E
5|$|The New York Automobile Club {{released}} another plan in 1933. This plan made {{no changes}} to NY9A; however, US9 {{was changed to}} use Broadway {{all the way through}} the Bronx and to travel to New Jersey by way of the Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive–Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY9A used what had been planned as US9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (detouring around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The main approach, {{from the}} north, is defended by earthworks, {{comprising}} three ditches, with a rampart, or earthen wall, between. Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage, traditionally said to lead into the castle, {{but in fact}} accessing an 18th-century ice house. There are no openings within {{the lower part of}} the castle's walls, excepting <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> the postern, or side gate, to the west, although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys. Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard, but were never built. The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble, with dressings in lighter Ballengeich stone.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} a {{concentric}} fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle's design had focused on defence, {{with the result that}} the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the original intent of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> the high water table may have caused serious damp problems on the ground floor. Furthermore, the design was different from the other Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King's general intent for the chain of forts.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} water known as Carrick Roads {{at the mouth}} of the River Fal was an {{important}} anchorage serving shipping arriving from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A small gun tower, called the Little Dennis Blockhouse, was built in 1539 overlooking <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> <b>and</b> plans were made to protect the anchorage further with five additional castles. In the event, only two of these were constructed, Pendennis and St Mawes Castle, positioned on each side of Carrick Roads and able to provide overlapping fire across the water. John Killigrew, a prominent member of the local Cornish gentry, probably oversaw the construction of Pendennis; it was built on his land and he was appointed as its first captain. Pendennis Castle cost £5,614 to construct.|$|E
5|$|Theories vary among {{archaeologists and}} historians {{regarding}} {{who built the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage, and when. One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century. The Culavamsa, an ancient chronicle, mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth relic of the Buddha. Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island, including Rajavaliya and Poojavaliya, which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla. However, according to the studies of Arthur Maurice Hocart, Nissanka Malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>and</b> outer porch. Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the ancient Mahavamsa, and historian H. W. Codrington both agree with this theory. A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions. In this, he claims that it was built {{by one of his}} generals under his own direction.|$|E
