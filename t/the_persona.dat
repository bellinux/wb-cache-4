5|$|Atlus {{has created}} or hosted media {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> series. A dedicated magazine originally ran for ten issues between 2011 and 2012, {{and has been}} irregularly revived since then. An official talk show released on the official Persona website and Niconico, Persona Stalkers Club, began in February 2014. Hosted by freelance writer Mafia Kajita and actress Tomomi Isomura, {{it was designed to}} deepen the connection between Atlus and <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> fanbase. Concerts featuring music from <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> series have also been performed, and some have received commercial releases on home media in Japan. Action figures and merchandise such as clothing related to Persona 3 and 4 have also been produced.|$|E

40|$|This paper details {{results of}} an {{experiment}} to empirically evaluate the effectiveness and user acceptability of human-like synthetic agents in a multi-modal electronic retail scenario. <b>The</b> synthetic <b>personae</b> played <b>the</b> roles of interactive conversational sales assistants. The range of life-like personae differed with respect to gender and technology. Participants {{took part in the}} controlled experiment, which involved them eavesdropping on spoken dialogues between a customer and each of <b>the</b> synthetic <b>personae.</b> They also completed questionnaires and took part in a debriefing interview designed to elicit information relating to the effectiveness, believability and perceived quality of each of <b>the</b> <b>personae.</b> Results show that participants expected a high level of realistic and human-like verbal and non-verbal communicative behaviour in <b>the</b> synthetic <b>personae.</b> This was demonstrated in the strong preference for personae that exhibited natural facial expressions, gestures and emotions. It was also found that disembodied voices were significantly preferred to many of <b>the</b> <b>personae.</b> In addition, results show participants had significantly different attitudes to the voices of <b>the</b> <b>personae...</b>|$|R

5|$|Concept {{work began}} {{during the middle}} of {{production}} on <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The PS2 remake changed a number of gameplay elements, introduced further cutscenes, adjusted the music, and added the third-person perspective in response to a common trend in Japan of first-person games causing motion sickness. The game sold well in Japan, and was met with mixed to positive reviews worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. <b>The</b> <b>Persona</b> series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> third <b>persona</b> is <b>the</b> implied {{audience}} {{which is}} not present, or is excluded from, rhetorical communication. This conception of <b>the</b> Third <b>Persona</b> relates to <b>the</b> First <b>Persona,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "I" [...] in discourse (a speaker and their intent), and <b>the</b> second <b>persona,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "you" [...] in discourse. Third Persona is [...] "the 'it' that is not present, that is objectified {{in a way that}} 'you' and 'I' are not." [...] Third Persona, as a theory, seeks to define and critique the rules of rhetoric, to further consider how we talk about what we talk about—the discourse of discourse—and who is affected by that discourse. [...] The concept of <b>the</b> third <b>persona</b> encourages examination of who (what category of implied audience) is implicitly excluded from a discourse, why they are excluded, and what this can tell us about how that discourse participates in larger networks of social or political power.|$|R
5000|$|In {{line with}} <b>the</b> <b>persona's</b> {{suggested}} weakness and sickness, other scholars take the word [...] "porphyria" [...] literally, {{and suggest that}} the seductress embodies a disease, and that <b>the</b> <b>persona's</b> killing of her {{is a sign of}} his recovery. Porphyria, which usually involved delusional madness and death, was classified several years before the poem's publication; Browning, who had an avid interest in such pathologies, may well have been aware of the new disease, and used it in this way to express his knowledge.|$|R
5|$|Kaye {{originally}} {{worked as}} a high-school teacher while beginning a career in professional wrestling. He joined WWE in mid-2005. His wrestling character drew inspiration from his previous job, as Kaye, now calling himself Matt Striker, quickly developed <b>the</b> <b>persona</b> of a heel (villainous) teacher. In 2008, Striker began working as a color commentator for WWE's ECW brand and then SmackDown brand. After leaving the WWE in 2013, {{he worked on the}} independent circuit before joining Lucha Underground as a commentator.|$|E
5|$|Monster re-entered {{the auto}} audio {{market in the}} early 1990s with {{a new line of}} speaker cables and its first speaker product, <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> One. Its {{high-end}} M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, which led to the distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec in-car audio brand in 1998.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Context: Dementia {{has a high}} global prevalence, {{and the number of}} people with {{dementia}} (PWDem) worldwide is expected to rise in coming years. The various symptoms associated with dementia can cause difficulties for PWDem when engaging with activities of daily living (ADLs) as the disease progresses. However, designing a care environment which enables PWDem to successfully engage with ADLs is not a simple task, in part because PWDem may find it difficult to communicate their needs to a design team. For this reason, design personas which aimed to represent PWDem at different stages of the disease were created as a means of communicating these needs to designers. This paper describes an evaluation study on these personas. Objectives: To consult design stakeholders and obtain feedback on the use of <b>the</b> <b>personas</b> in <b>the</b> process of designing a dementia care home. Methodology: Interviews and focus groups were used to obtain feedback on <b>the</b> <b>personas.</b> Main results: Participants suggested several improvements for <b>the</b> <b>personas.</b> These included (1) diagrams (images and symbols) rather than text, (2) focusing less on specific design guidance, and (3) including a wider range of symptoms and needs. Conclusion: The wide range of suggested changes from the participants indicated both engagement with, and potential for, <b>the</b> initial <b>personas.</b> <b>The</b> <b>personas</b> have been revised and will be tested in care homes to explore how far they accurately represent the needs of PWDem both with caregivers and PWDem...|$|R

5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of <b>the</b> <b>Persona</b> series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

5000|$|Marginalization is {{the being}} or being made {{socially}} marginal through {{a denial of}} power.
