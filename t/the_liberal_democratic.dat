5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democratic</b> monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} Minister until the 10 May 1941 {{election}} when the Mair Government {{was defeated in}} a landslide defeat, losing 20 seats. Despite this, Treatt retained his seat with a significant margin increase of 67.68%. With the very poor results of the federal United Australia Party under Billy Hughes at the 1943 Federal election, the UAP disintegrated. A large number of former UAP members, including Treatt, then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Alexander Mair, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944. Mair resigned in 1944 {{to be replaced by}} Reginald Weaver, who then led the hopelessly divided conservative forces to defeat at the 27 May 1944 election, losing another three seats. Treatt retained his seat with 50.50%.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} very poor results of the federal United Australia Party under Billy Hughes at the 1943 Federal election, the UAP disintegrated. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who became Opposition Leader, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944. With the {{conservative}} vote split in half, Mair had little chance, and resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, {{to be replaced by}} Weaver, who then became Party Leader and Leader of the Opposition. Weaver then led the party to the 1944 election where it won 19% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Weaver himself retained his seat with 56.90%.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This {{is not the first time}} legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E
