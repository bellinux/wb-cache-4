A window of vulnerability to single-event snapback is shown to exist below the single-event upset threshold. The presence of single-event snapback in commercial SOI SRAMS is confirmed through broadbeam ion testing, and implications for hardness assurance testing of SOI integrated circuits are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Novel circularly {{polarized}} (CP) antenna configurations derived from Moxon type antenna (bent dipole element over a ground plane) for broadband VHF SATCOM applications. A sequence of topologies starting {{from a single}} vertical element to two vertical elements of the Moxon arms, then widened strip arm elements were studied. Further, arms were widened to bow <b>tie</b> <b>structures</b> with bents at 900. for achieving broadband operation. Bow tie elements were further split and optimized at a certain angle to achieve wider bandwidth. The logic in this evolution was to obtain highest possible gain based on Fano-Chu limits, which suggests that higher gain can be achieved in an electrically small antenna with maximized metallization in the structure that fill the volume. Circular polarization is obtained by two Moxon based cross elements that are fed through a hybrid 900 quadrature coupler. For the antennas that are prototyped, return loss S 11 measurements were performed, and gains are simulated using HFSS. For the band of 225 - 400 MHz, antenna gain varies between 8 - 12 dB, and S 11 is measured to be below 10 dB. Fabricated antennas coupled to a hybrid coupler yielded excellent bandwidths, low cross-polarization and low back lobes on the finite ground planes...|$|E

30|$|Considering {{the fact}} that certain triphone {{contexts}} may rarely occur or even be missing in a training set, we investigate tying triphone templates into clusters of equivalent contexts to improve the reliability of template matching {{as well as to}} handle unseen triphones in recognition. Among many possible clustering algorithms, we decide to utilize the PDT <b>tying</b> <b>structures</b> of the triphone states in the baseline HMMs directly to cluster triphone segments, since the <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> of a phone state indicates partial similarities among triphone segments. We assume that each phone HMM has three emitting states as commonly used in HTK [31]. For the triphone templates of each monophone, we keep the three <b>tying</b> <b>structures</b> defined by the three emitting states of the corresponding phone HMM and use them jointly in template matching.|$|R

40|$|Social {{networks}} {{are regarded as}} powerful resources that have available novel solutions, innovative ideas and can create new pathways. Networks exist as informal webs of affiliation between individuals and also as ties between organisations {{in the form of}} professional networks. These different forms of networks have in common that there is a social structure that connects particular agents with each other and enables the flow of information and knowledge between them. Thus, in creating new ties and connecting already existing networks/individuals/organisations, a richer structure is created and with it access options to novel knowledge. The exchange and combination of knowledge is a means for creating innovations. The national initiative “Learning Regions – Providing Support for Networks” (2001 - 2008) fostered this macro-structural change process in Germany on a regional level, so that a new learning culture and with it innovative products and ideas could emerge. An underlying concept for this programme is the theory on ‘learning organisations’ (Senge et al. 2007) which is referred to concerning the interpretation of the data. Moreover, in order also to focus on the associated change processes, the guiding theoretical elaborations of Scharmer’s “Theory U” are applied to the findings. In this thesis the data gathered during the evaluation of this initiative are re-analysed with the research focus on particular social role inhabitants in networks: network managers. Based on a combination of survey and network data as well as expert interviews, the structural position and the resulting perspectives, perceptions and role learning processes are explored. By means of interpreting the findings, the thesis illustrates a developmental role-taking process for network managers with five stages along a U-curve. Thus, it becomes evident that the above described structural changes of interaction and knowledge flows are accompanied by deep change and the acquisition of certain skills. These skills are identified for example as a high tolerance for complexity and uncertainty, a “bridging capacity”, an awareness of <b>tie</b> <b>structures,</b> a high level of personal mastery and the capacity to act skilfully in interdependent structures and perceive himself or herself {{as part of a larger}} system. Network management is recognized as a service function that needs to be filled in professional educational networks. In the networks of the learning regions, network managers are inclined to act as societal change agents and social entrepreneurs who try to induce a process of conscious co-evolution within a defined region...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{proposed}} a new derivative to conventional continuous density hidden Markov modeling (CDHMM) that we call "subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov modeling" (SDCHMM). SDCHMMs can be created by tying low-dimensional subspace Gaussians in CDHMMs. In tasks we tried, usually only 32 - 256 subspace Gaussian prototypes were needed in SDCHMM-based system to maintain recognition performance of its original CDHMM-based system - a reduction of Gaussian parameters by one to three orders of magnitude. Consequently, both recognition time and memory were greatly reduced. We also have showed that if the underlying subspace distribution <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> is known, it {{may be used to}} train an SDCHMM-based system with as little as eight minutes of speech from scratch. All the results suggest that there is substantial redundancy in conventional CDHMM and that SDCHMM is a more compact model. In this paper, we analyze the <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> from two perspectives: from the acoustic-phonetic perspective showing that the <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> seems to capture prominent relationship among phones; and, from the model-theoretic perspective showing that SDCHMMs, if properly created from CDHMMs, may be preferred over the latter as they are less complex and have the potential of greater generalization power...|$|R

A conventional maximum likelihood-based decision tree construction algorithm {{was used to}} tie HMM states. In the conventional HMM-based speech synthesis framework, a unique <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> (decision tree) is normally incorporated for both voicing probabilities and F 0 output probabilities. As opposed to the conventional HMM-based synthesis system, the proposed method uses a soft decision tree structure for the output probability distribution and a hard decision tree for voicing probabilities; therefore, we cannot apply the same <b>tying</b> <b>structure</b> for both voicing and output probabilities in the proposed system. With a view to having a fair comparison, {{the baseline}} system was implemented with two different decision trees for F 0 trajectories, one for the voicing labels {{and the other for}} the output probability distributions.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} {{a novel approach}} of integrating template matching with statistical modeling for continuous speech recognition. The approach inherits the GMMs and the PDT state <b>tying</b> <b>structures</b> from the baseline HMMs and is therefore easily implemented.

Based on our experimental results from the tasks of TIMIT phone recognition and telehealth LVCSR, we conclude that the proposed method of integrating template matching and statistical modeling has significantly improved the recognition performance over our HMM baselines, and the proposed template selection and compression methods have also largely saved computation time and memory space over using all templates with small losses in accuracy performance. Although in the current work we used the basic acoustic modeling techniques to train our HMM baselines, the proposed template matching methods {{can take advantage of}} and add value to more advanced GMM/HMM systems, and as such they are promising for further improving the state-of-the-art speech recognition.|$|R
