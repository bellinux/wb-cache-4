Operations of the two stations, along with production of KMSB's 9:00p.m. newscast, were assumed by Raycom's CBS station KOLD-TV. Belo Media Operations president Peter L. Diaz touted that the consolidation would result in [...] "better produced, increased news programming for the Tucson market," [...] citing Raycom's addition of a locally produced morning newscast to KMSB, and the upgrade of KMSB's news programming to high definition {{as part of the}} transition. Although ruling out the need to do so in other markets, Diaz noted that the agreements [...] " [...] us <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> news product that we couldn't afford to do otherwise." [...] The consolidation resulted in layoffs for almost all of the two stations' employees, aside from advertising sales staff, which remained employed by Belo but worked from KOLD's facilities. The acquisition of Belo by Gannett in 2013 had few effects on the virtual triopoly; although the stations' licenses were sold to third-parties to satisfy newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, Raycom still operates the stations, but their sales departments remained operated by Gannett. The licenses were, in turn, sold to Tegna—the spin-out of Gannett's broadcasting division, in December 2015.|$|E

He wrote a formal letter to Quinton which asked for the bidding process to be reopened as the network was barred from bettering BSkyB's bid. Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms {{but as far as}} the potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed that it was only after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage were we informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor were we given any opportunity <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>our</b> bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and it would be wrong to force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E
