5|$|On 27 February 1939 <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was {{unpacking}} {{boxes and}} accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway. The fire quickly spread {{and the house}} was severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded that the fire had been started deliberately.|$|E
5|$|As the 999-year {{leasehold}} {{building has}} been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for architectural conservation, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> {{was asked to}} preserve the building's façade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out on the building from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles.|$|E
5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler {{was able}} to move back into his castle, which was now {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered it impossible to defend. The Countess of Kent, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E
50|$|The Brighthope Railway {{bought the}} Clover Hill in {{bankruptcy}} and became <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> of <b>the</b> bridge in 1877. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> increased passenger travel. In, 1881, the Brighthope owners converted the gauge to narrow gauge.|$|R
50|$|In May 2009, HRP Creative Services Co. {{wanted to}} make certain attractions {{separate}} from <b>the</b> park <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> planned, with former park CEO Steven Goodwin wanting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> to pay royalties. However, a Delaware federal judge said on March 30 {{that some of the}} previous owners still owned intellectual property rights relating to the original theme. The original owners then sued FPI, claiming they had not done enough to change the park, and that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> were using intellectual property that was not theirs. This action threatened to delay the reopening.|$|R
50|$|On 19 October 2011, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> officially relaunched Oddbins.|$|R
5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Peter Angelos, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of the Orioles, {{met with}} Armstrong and Saul Landau, who {{convinced}} him to pursue an exhibition series between his Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team. Angelos petitioned the United States Government to permit a series. United States Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen wrote to the State Department, asking that the series be prevented. The United States Department of the Treasury denied Angelos' request {{on the grounds that}} American money may not be spent in Cuba under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of Swakeleys, CES Properties (Ickenham), {{received}} {{planning permission}} from Hillingdon Council {{to convert the}} house back into a single large residence, including 23 en-suite bedrooms, a party pavilion and a stable. CES Properties placed restrictions on the staging of the Ickenham Festival that year, leading to the festival's organising committee relocating its planned gala day and evening events to the nearby Vyners School. The festival had previously used {{the grounds of the}} house as a focal point for events. CES Properties placed the house up for sale in February 2015 for £45 million.|$|E

Purchased by the Rockwell brothers in 1925, the airfield was renamed Rockwell Field, and Western Air Express (WAE) introduced {{commercial air service}} in April 1926. When the brothers sold Rockwell Field and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> canceled WAE's lease, the airline had to look for another airport. Local businessman P. A. Simon had built an airfield northeast of the city, now known as Nellis Air Force Base, to which WAE relocated in November 1929.|$|E
5|$|Following Farsari's {{departure}} from Japan in 1890, his studio continued to operate and even listed him as proprietor until 1901, when Tonokura Tsunetarō became the owner. Tonokura, whom Farsari had known since the mid-1870s, had long managed {{the day-to-day operations}} of the studio. In 1904 Tonokura left the business {{to start his own}} studio and another of Farsari's former employees, Watanabe Tokutarō, became <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner,</b> only to be succeeded by the former secretary, Fukagawa Itomaro. The business was finally registered as a Japanese company in 1906 and it continued to operate until at least 1917 and possibly as late as 1923, the year in which Yokohama was largely destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake. A. Farsari & Co. was the last notable foreign-owned photographic studio to operate in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Investors on Wall Street {{were putting}} their money into Marconi's system {{and some in}} the press began turning against Tesla's project, {{claiming}} it was a hoax, AuthorHouse, page 35 The project {{came to a halt}} in 1905 and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($ in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> to make the land a more viable real estate asset.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} acts of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> was to cease store {{operations}} in certain states, with stores in Minnesota being the first to close. Locations in Minnesota were {{much larger than the}} normal store of about a few had restaurants. The size of these stores, and their proximity to Target Corporation, made <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> think them unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|According to FCC filings, {{the station}} was sold to Indigo Radio LLC in July 2008. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> did {{not have access to}} the prior station's studio or {{broadcast}} facilities. They received FCC permission for construction at a new location. As of December 2008, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> applied for an additional 90 days to remain silent while they constructed their new facilities.|$|R
5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had been in business for over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner,</b> but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests made it hard for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they closed their doors.|$|E

He then has a brief relationship with Jazz Curtis (Rachel Gordon).|$|E
5|$|The castle {{passed to}} John's grandson, also called John, who, in 1304, married Joan de Barr. The {{marriage}} broke down but John's attempts {{to gain a}} divorce in 1316 failed in the law courts. John blamed Thomas, the Earl of Lancaster, for this and in response he kidnapped Thomas' wife; Thomas then retaliated by seizing Conisbrough Castle. Edward II intervened in the dispute and confirmed Thomas as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of the castle. In 1322, however, Thomas rebelled against the King and was executed, resulting in Edward taking control of Conisbrough himself. The King visited the castle in 1322, and spent 40 marks on repairing both Conisbrough and the neighbouring castle of Pontefract. Edward was overthrown by his wife Isabella in 1326 and the castle was returned to John. John had hoped to pass the property to his mistress and two illegitimate sons, but he outlived them and on his death in 1347 it reverted to {{the control of the}} Crown.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} acts of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> was to cease store {{operations}} in certain states, with stores in Minnesota being the first to close.

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the REO bid to develop the site, in February 2012, Battersea Power Station was put up for sale on the open market {{for the first time in}} its history. The sale was {{conducted}} by commercial estate agent Knight Frank on behalf of the site's creditors. In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings' Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London & Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley. If sold, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> would have to pay £500 million for the power station, including £325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds, and a £100 million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale is unsuccessful, the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve the site in line with its listed status.|$|E
5|$|Goya went to {{exile in}} France in 1824, and {{ownership}} of the house passed to his grandson Mariano. An 1830 inventory by Brugada indicates that the work took a full wall between two windows on the first floor, opposite A Pilgrimage to San Isidro. On the wall to the right were Saturn Devouring His Son and Judith and Holofernes. Leocadia, Two Old Men and Two Old Men Eating Soup were on the left wall. Art historian Lawrence Gowing observed that the lower floor was divided thematically, with a male side– Saturn and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro– and a female side– Judith and Holofernes, Witches' Sabbath and Leocadia. The house changed owners {{a number of times}} before March 1873, when it came into the possession of the Belgian Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger, who speculated that the area would appreciate in value over the coming years. The murals had deteriorated badly after many years on the walls. To preserve them, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of the house had them transferred to canvas {{under the direction of the}} art restorer of the Museo del Prado, Salvador Martinez Cubells. Following their exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878, where they were met with little reaction, d'Erlanger donated them to the Spanish state in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive and begins a feud with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he {{will not be able to}} handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of the pub. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank's Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquillisers. When Frank's daughter, Janine (Charlie Brooks), taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a baseball bat. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is Sharon.|$|E
