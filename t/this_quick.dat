On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had been listening to Western radio broadcasts.

25|$|Estimated {{completion}} schedules slipped over time.

When construction began in 2007, the MTA stated that the new train line would open by the end of 2013. Later in 2007, the MTA gave a completion date of 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA pushed back completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA pushed it back again to 2016. Some publications had predicted a December 2016 opening. Others reported that the subway would not open until 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{first week}} of the 1912 season {{presented}} in conjunction with the Australian impresario J.C. Williamson, at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, put up a record still unbroken and likely to remain so: four Australian premieres in eight days. The company opened on Saturday, 8 June (having only arrived in the country the previous Wednesday), with a gala premiere of The Tales of Hoffmann, followed on the Monday by the first performance in Australia of the Paris version of Tannhäuser, the Australian premiere of The Girl of the Golden West on the Tuesday, another performance of Hoffmann on the Wednesday, Rigoletto on the Thursday, the Australian premiere of Tristan und Isolde on the Friday, and the Australian premiere of The Prodigal Son by Debussy as part of a double bill with Hänsel und Gretel on the Saturday afternoon, with Hoffmann again that night. <b>This</b> <b>quick</b> start and rate of bringing forward new productions was only possible because this was a complete company, with its own chorus and orchestra — the only one to visit Australia — and had already performed all its repertoire in England and South Africa on its way to Australia.|$|E

500|$|Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base {{commands}} including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No.7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out {{of first}} Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He {{then returned to}} RAAF Station Laverton {{to take charge of}} No.1 Aircraft Depot (No.1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of <b>this</b> <b>quick</b> succession of postings across the country: [...] "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of <b>this</b> <b>quick</b> advance, Charles found his army in chaos, with Skippon's force {{organised}} and flanking them. The Royalist council of war reconvened to discuss the events, and accounts suggest the meeting was acrimonious, {{with the fall of}} Round Hill described as [...] "a most gross and absurd error". Rupert decided to try to contain both Essex and Skippon. Leaving two regiments of horse with Byron, he led the remainder of the cavalry to Essex's position on the left flank. Byron, in the meantime, was commanded to support an attack by the Royalist musketeers on Skippon's force, drawing his regiments up behind the infantry [...] "ready to second them in case the enemy's horse should advance towards them". Rupert's advance has been criticised by both Parliamentarian and Royalist sources; instead of a small engagement, the stubbornness of the Parliamentary resistance forced Rupert to commit more and more forces to the fray, eventually turning a series of small engagements into a full-scale battle, with reinforcements gradually being drawn in. The terrain limited the localised advantage Rupert's forces had in numbers, but after three attacks Stapleton's brigade crumbled, allowing Rupert to hook around Essex's left flank, stop his advance and capture five pieces of artillery. This came at a cost; the Royalists took heavy casualties, and failed to completely break Essex's infantry. The infantry instead stubbornly retreated, allowing the Parliamentary cavalry to reorganise behind them. Even though his advance had been stopped, Essex was not yet beaten.|$|E

500|$|Harris led one {{of three}} groups of fighters on the third strike, Strike 2C. The fighter groups were {{organized}} with six planes at high cover (...) , three at intermediate cover and four flying low cover. After the bombers made their runs, the low cover team dove to [...] to protect the bombers {{as they left the}} target site. High cover spotted numerous targets on the ground below, so they descended to replace low cover, strafing parked aircraft as they flew {{along the length of the}} complex. This left Harris's intermediate cover division the only one positioned to see three Nakajima Ki-44 ("Tojo") fighters coming in from above the strike group. Before they could surprise the air group, Harris attacked them from 6 o'clock, riddling one plane's cockpit and engine with bullets. <b>This</b> <b>quick</b> kill caused the other two [...] "Tojos" [...] in the division to break off into the clouds. With that threat neutralized, intermediate cover circled the field, finding three more [...] "Tojos" [...] at lower altitude. Approaching from above and behind, Harris shot down his second [...] "Tojo" [...] of the day, and like the first, its companies fled combat. While high and intermediate cover were occupying lower altitudes, dozens of enemy aircraft appeared above the air group. They did not seem interested in the bombers: they went straight after the fighter escort, using superior height to their advantage. Despite solid tactical flying from the Japanese, and an early disadvantage in height for the Americans, the Intrepid fighters claimed at least 10 more enemy aircraft including two more for Harris, bringing his day's total four. Only two of VF-18's Hellcats received minor damage; none were lost.|$|E
