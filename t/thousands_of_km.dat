30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{earthquakes}} interact with each other. For example, large shallow earthquakes are typically followed by increased seismic activity in nearby regions, known as “aftershocks” (e.g., Utsu et al., 1995). However, only recently seismologists started to realize that large earthquakes could also cause a significant increase of seismic activity in regions that are several hundreds to <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>kms</b> away (e.g., Hill et al., 1993; Brodsky et al., 2000; Gomberg et al., 2001; Hough and Kanamori, 2002; Kilb et al., 2002; Hough et al., 2003; Gomberg et al., 2004; Prejean et al., 2004; Freed, 2005; Hill and Prejean, 2007; Velasco et al., 2008). Because static stresses resulting from fault displacements fall off more rapidly and become negligible beyond several hundred kms (e.g., Freed, 2005), the elevated seismicity at large distances is generally considered as “remotely triggered” by the dynamic stresses during the passage of seismic waves generated by large earthquakes. Since the immediate cause of these triggered events is apparent and relatively easy to quantify, systematic analysis of remote triggering offers a unique opportunity for better understanding the underlying mechanism of earthquake interaction and physics of earthquake occurrence.|$|R

30|$|Outdoor OW links are a {{high-bandwidth}} and low-power-consumption alternative in {{satellite communications}} [4] and OW links {{have been successfully}} demonstrated in satellite-to-satellite, earth-to-satellite and earth-to-moving-vehicle links [188 – 199]. Satellite systems are the most challenging category of outdoor OW systems, because of the very long distances that the optical beams propagate through vacuum or the atmosphere. Optical links that operate in vacuum (inter-satellite and space communications) are at least tens <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>kms</b> long. Even if the vacuum {{is considered to be}} ideal (lossless), the associated path losses that increase with the square of the link distance are enormous, and vary from approximately 150 dB in satellite-to-satellite communications to approximately 230 dB in Mars-to-Earth communications. Earth-to-satellite optical links involves shorter distances, up to approximately 36, 000 km for a geostationary orbit, but the total system losses are increased due to scattering and absorption in the atmosphere [150, 152]. Hence, a key consideration in satellite communications is the received optical power and several techniques have been proposed to mitigate the transmission associated losses. Optical amplification is an appealing candidate [200 – 203], especially in earth-to-satellite uplinks where low power consumption limitations do not apply. Another possible candidate in earth-to-satellite communications is the use of flying vehicles and high-altitude-platforms as beam relays [204 – 206]. When no amplification or intermediate relays are available, as in deep space communications [207], the losses may not be mitigated and more sophisticated receivers that operate at very low powers (photon-counting) are required [208].|$|R
