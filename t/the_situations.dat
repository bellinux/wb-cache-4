Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips.

Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. <b>The</b> <b>situations</b> in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E

In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from personal experience <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left.

40|$|Abstract: From ‘Operation Cast Lead’ to ‘Operation Protective Edge’, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine {{has been}} one of <b>the</b> most {{controversial}} <b>situations</b> to come before the International Criminal Court. In January 2015, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda agreed to engage in a preliminary examination of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine pursuant to a declaration by the State of Palestine granting the ICC jurisdiction in terms of article 12 (3) of the Rome Statute. Considering the various requirements underlying the preliminary examination of a <b>situation</b> state, <b>the</b> author concludes that the ICC has jurisdiction over <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine, that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is admissible before the ICC, that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is of sufficient gravity to warrant further attention by the ICC and that it will be in the interests of justice for the ICC to investigate <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> further. <b>The</b> author argues that the ICC Prosecutor should find that the preliminary examination of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine results in a proper investigation of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and <b>the</b> potential prosecution of members of both the Palestinian armed groups and Israeli Defence Force. The failure of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor to conduct further investigations of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine will have far-reaching implications and significant consequences for Palestinians, Israelis and the ICC alike.

5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the Global War on Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E

Eventually the arrival of Audacious and Superb on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in Formidable.

5|$|The {{process is}} {{repeated}} multiple times; {{in each of}} the five worlds the group travel through, they find and awaken the corrupted crystals, Airy performs her ritual in the pillar of light, and they are thrown into a new parallel world. In each world, they find variations on <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> they encountered in their own world, and gradually learn several truths about themselves and their adversaries. Nearly all of the Eternian elite they face were taken in by Braev out of compassion as they were rejected by the Orthodoxy, Ringabel is actually a parallel version of Dark Knight Alternis Dim, a close friend of Edea, and Yulyana and DeRosso were key figures in cleansing the original incarnation of the Orthodoxy of corruption. During their travels, both Yulyana and DeRosso give subtle warnings to Tiz and Agnès about Airy's intentions; meanwhile, Ringabel's memories slowly return, and he recalls Airy turning into a monster and murdering the previous incarnations of the party. In truth, Airy is an agent of Ouroboros, an evil being using the crystals as a means of linking all worlds as an energy sources to reach and conquer the Celestial Realm.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Montag and Pratt as {{a single}} entity competed as housemates on the {{eleventh}} series of the British version of Celebrity Big Brother, where they notably developed a minor feud with singer and television personality Rylan Clark. They were named the runners-up, losing to Clark. On February 18, Channel 5 aired a one-off television special discussing Montag and Pratt's rise to prominence, titled Speidi: Scandal, Secrets & Surgery!. Later that year, they launched the Speidi Show, which was initially {{assumed to be a}} web series in which the couple used a different reality television format for each installment. However, the project was later revealed to be an example of networked improv narrative, where Montag and Pratt collaborated with Mark Marino and Rob Wittig to create a Twitter game in which players Live Tweet an imaginary show. In October 2013, Montag revealed that her original F-cup breast implants resulted in severe health issues, and underwent a breast reduction surgery to replace them with D-cup implants. She and Pratt appeared in the television special After Shock: Heidi & Spencer, which premiered on December 9, 2013, on E!, during which they admitted that many of <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> they were involved with in the various reality series they starred on were in fact made up by the shows producers. Montag and Pratt later appeared on an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap in June 2014, for which they swapped with Olympic athlete Amanda Beard and her husband Sacha Brown. In October 2015, Montag and her husband made several media appearances that were largely devoted to two subjects: claiming that their image as terrible people stemming from The Hills was not factual and, somewhat divergently, their intense dislike of Lauren Conrad, which included Montag's husband admitting he spread rumors (which Montag said were true but have never been proven) that Conrad made a sex tape with a former boyfriend. Montag also claimed she had been paid to remain Conrad's friend during her time on the show, while also adding she had reconciled with her family to her husband's displeasure.|$|E

As an application of this isomorphism, we investigate thoroughly a notion of goal ordering, and show its usefulness by applying it in a provably correct way to both linear and nonlinear planning. Introduction One of the features of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus (McCarthy [14]) is that a situation carries information about its history.
