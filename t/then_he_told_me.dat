2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he had a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

60|$|He said nothing, but put {{the key in}} his pocket. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to watch}} at {{one side of the}} churchyard whilst he would watch at the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was <b>then</b> that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{the names of all}} the tenants. He used to scold me because I did not {{understand}} the nature of their leases." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Travers {{from the}} police, sir, 'e called {{to see me}} at the club, and 'e took me in a taxicab to Grosvenor Square, and told the shoffer, sir, to pull up by the curb on the garden side. <b>Then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to watch a partik'lar 'ouse {{opposite}} and see 'oo was goin' in or out. I didn't 'arf like it, sir, because I'm not supposed to absent myself for very long of a morning, though the committee ain't very partik'lar. But Mr. Travers 'e was of the police, sir, so I thought it was right to do as <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} there was any truth in what {{everybody}} was saying about their fighting a duel?" [...] asked Mr. Kennedy. His wife made no answer, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> continued--"You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of your own knowledge that it was untrue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{that was}} old Johnson," [...] he answered. [...] "Don't you be frightened of that; he lives here." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the poor thing's history.|$|E
6000|$|He cautioned me {{once more}} to be 'as silent as the grave;' <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he was a 'red-handed murderer.' He put down his plane, held his hands out before him, {{contemplated}} them sadly, and said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is all safe. Citizen Heron {{came to see}} him, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to {{lock the}} little vermin up in the inner room. Citizen Cochefer had just arrived by that time, and he has {{remained}} in charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> further <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that his}} mother had brought home with her a Mrs. Sandford with a daughter, heiress to L60,000, and to a newly-bought estate in Surrey, and newly-built house [...] "of the most {{desirable}} description," [...] he added, shrugging his shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|Nicole Krauss {{includes}} {{a reference to}} Lorca in her novel Great House (2010): [...] "It was <b>then</b> that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the desk had been used, briefly, by Lorca." [...] (p.11) The desk is the central metaphor for memory and the burden of inheritance, used throughout the novel. Also see page 13. Krauss also refers to Neruda the poet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me be {{took down}} then!' cried the informer, eagerly and anxiously. 'Let me be took down, for by George and the Draggin I'm a coming to it now! Don't {{do nothing to}} keep back from a honest man {{the fruits of the}} sweat of his brow! I give information, <b>then,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> done it. Is THAT enough?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> roughly {{to get me}} gone; but 'I {{had laughed}} [...] on the lass with my bonny black eye.' So the next day I [...] got an invite to Glenbogie, and at the {{appropriate}} time in [...] August, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{my money}} alone. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was}} engaged to you. He had never told me before, but yet I knew it. It all came out then. Lucy, though he is engaged to you, it is me that he loves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said to me, `This {{is only a}} temple; I {{am trying}} to find a house.' And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> with indelicate haste that the lamp outside his house was green, and that there was a red post at the corner of it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> {{had become}} the tenant of Uriah Heep's old house; and that Mrs. Micawber would be delighted to receive me, once more, under her own roof.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>he</b> {{had found}} her married again to Farmer Morton and implored {{her to come back}} to him. She refused, and he, in a blind fury, rushed back to where he had left Marx.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vell, I didn't {{go because}} of bein' axed to go, {{you may be}} sure o' that, but my little dosser, Tim Lumpy, you {{remember}} 'im? The cove wi' the nose like a button, an' no body to speak of--all legs an' arms, like a 'uman win'-mill; vell, you must know they've nabbed 'im, an' given 'im a rig-out o' noo slops, an' they're goin' to send 'im to Canada. So I 'appened to be down near the 'Ome one day three weeks past, an' I see Lumpy a-goin' in. `'Allo!' says I. `'Allo!' says 'e; an' <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all about it. `Does they feed you well?' I axed. `Oh! don't they, just!' said 'e. `There's to be a blow hout this wery night,' said 'e. `I wonder,' says I, `if they'd let me in, for I'm uncommon 'ungry, I tell you; 'ad nuffin' to heat since last night.' Just as I said that, a lot o' fellers like me came tumblin' up to the door--so I sneaked in wi' the rest--for I thought they'd kick me hout if they knowed I'd come without inwitation." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{he would}} first swear to me himself, {{that he would}} never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take my side to the last drop of blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{at first}} he had bought the {{houseboat}} {{and was going to}} take her to New Orleans. He wanted me to go along and finish the repairs, and I didn't find out what was really up till we got to the Lake Sico bayou. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if I didn't stick to him he'd shoot me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of {{his wife}} in England. 'My poor Strickland,' I said to him, 'they've all got a wife somewhere; that is {{generally}} why {{they come to the}} islands. Ata is a sensible girl, and she doesn't expect any ceremony before the Mayor. She's a Protestant, and you know they don't look upon these things like the Catholics.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} recommended--delicacy! No doubt {{you think that}} women should be delicate, let them suffer what they may. A woman should not {{let it be known}} that she has any human nature in her. I had him on the hip, and for a moment I used my power. He had {{certainly}} done me a wrong. He had asked for my love,--and with the delicacy which you commend, I had not at once grasped at all that such a request conveyed. <b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so frankly, 'he changed his mind!' Did he not wrong me?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was {{resolved}} not to differ {{with me in}} anything, and that therefore he would importune me no more about it, resolving to acquiesce in whatever I did or said; only begged I should then agree, that whatever it was, it should no more interrupt our quiet and our mutual kindness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But how do {{you know}} what passed between us,' said I. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> had seen and heard all. The dining-room was divided by folding- doors from an inner portion, and he had been sitting in the latter part when we entered the outer, so that our words were {{distinctly}} audible.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that there}} had been no time, and how useless my {{presence}} would have been. We sat on the sofa, and he gasped out something of the sad story, though not by any means all that I afterwards learnt from himself and from the Yollands, but enough to make me feel the reality of the terrible loss. And I will tell the whole here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, it's no matter, but he needn't {{have been}} so sharp, I thought. There was no harm in it though he did say son. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that you had spoken to him about me, {{and that he had}} found me {{employment}} in the House accordingly, and that I was expected to be attentive and punctual, and then he went away. I thought he didn't seem to like me much.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what I {{had little}} guessed, {{that we had}} been driven round and round, and were really only in the Faubourg St. Medand, in the Priory of the Benedictines, giving title and revenue to the Abbe St. Leu, which had {{contained}} no monks ever since the time of the Huguenots. He could go into Paris and return again before his turn to change guard was likely to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Mai-Mai!" [...] he cried, [...] "another bottle!" [...] And, when it came, {{with one}} stroke of a knife, he summarily {{beheaded}} it, and commanded me to drain {{it to the}} bottom. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if I would come on board his vessel the following morning, I would find the ship's articles on the cabin transom.|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Aisha also narrated: The Prophet in his fatal illness, {{called his}} {{daughter}} Fatima {{and told her}} a secret because of which she started weeping. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> called her and told her another secret, and she started laughing. When I asked her about that, she replied, [...] "The Prophet <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> would die in his fatal illness, and so I wept, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> secretly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that from amongst his family, I {{would be the first}} to join him, and so I laughed." [...] Sahih Muslim, Volume 4, Book 56: (Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and his Companions), Hadith Number 819.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has paid}} off your uncle's mortgage,' said Fagan; 'he gives Nora a coach-and-six; he is to sell out, and Lieutenant Ulick Brady of the Militia is to {{purchase}} his company. That coward of a fellow has been the making of your uncle's family. 'Faith! the business was well done.' And <b>then,</b> laughing, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how Mick and Ulick had never let him out of their sight, although he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin. 'Are you in want of cash, my boy?' continued the good-natured Captain. 'You may draw upon me, for I {{got a couple of}} hundred out of Master Quin for my share, and while they last you shall never want.' ...|$|R
60|$|On the poop I {{found the}} Elsinore, {{with many of}} her sails furled, {{slashing}} along through a troubled sea under an overcast sky. Also I found Mr. Mellaire marching up and down, just as I had left him hours before, and it took quite a distinct effort for me {{to realize that he}} had had the watch off between four and eight. Even <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> he had slept from four until half-past seven.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how, over {{my letters}} {{to him in}} New South Wales, there had come out Dermot's account of the early liking that {{everyone}} nipped, till my good-girlish submission wounded and affronted him, and he forgot or disliked me for years; how old feelings had revived, when we came in contact once more; but how he was withheld from their manifestation, by the miserable state of his affairs, {{as well as by}} my own coldness and indifference.|$|E
6000|$|... --Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But {{he gave me}} a great {{account of}} the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word {{borrowed}} another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the whole story.|$|E
60|$|My {{supposed}} shipmate bore me in {{mind to the}} last. When {{we reached}} his craft, he poured out a glass of brandy and offered it to me. I was afraid to drink, thinking it might be poisoned. He seemed to understand me, and swallowed it himself, in a significant manner. This gave me courage, and I took the next nip without hesitation. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to shove off, which I did without waiting for a second order. The pirates pulled away at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I interviewed {{this man}} Jones. I said to him: 'I {{am in the}} Honorable Frederick Threepwood's confidence. I know everything. Have you any {{instructions}} for me?' He replied: 'What do you know?' I answered: 'I know that the Honorable Frederick Threepwood has something he wishes to hand to you, but {{which he has been}} unable to hand to you owing to having had an accident and being confined to his room.' <b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to tell you to let him have the scarab by messenger." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wrote this}} around New Years when I {{was on a}} {{houseboat}} with my friends. We sometimes go on what are essentially drug and alcohol binge trips up the Murray River but this one fell {{in the middle of}} my album so I felt like I had to get some work done. My friend came into my room when I was working on songs and asked to hear some. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> basically <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> didnt really like my new music and he preferred when I was more raw. That was the reason for the line, “My friend <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> didnt like my songs, blame it on the drugs, let me right my wrongs.” I wrote the whole thing while I was really drunk and recorded a demo. When I woke up the next day I liked the song because it captured another side of me from usual, so we kept it." ...|$|R
