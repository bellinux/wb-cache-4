5|$|Etty {{was fascinated}} with {{classical}} artworks such as <b>those</b> <b>he</b> had seen during his recent travels in Italy, {{and in particular}} with the Elgin Marbles, a set of major Ancient Greek sculptures taken to London in controversial circumstances in the early 19th century.|$|E

60|$|Such was Alaric's {{theory of}} life. But not the less {{would he have}} {{expected}} gratitude from <b>those</b> whom <b>he</b> might serve. Such also very probably was Sir Gregory's theory when <b>he</b> thought of <b>those</b> who had helped him, instead of <b>those</b> whom <b>he</b> himself had helped.|$|R
5|$|He {{has since}} {{claimed to have}} 'perfected' the formula {{so that it will}} grant the {{subjects}} powers while also reverting <b>those</b> <b>he</b> chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, {{traveling}} {{as either}} Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left Tombstone {{for her family}} in San Francisco via Los Angeles on March 25, 1882. This was one week after Morgan Earp was assassinated and five days after Wyatt set out in pursuit of <b>those</b> <b>he</b> believed responsible.|$|E
5|$|Richard Romanus as Vinnie Genzianna, {{leader of}} the Stompers. A cool, stylish young man. Though he {{definitely}} has his problems, he does seem to care about <b>those</b> <b>he</b> is close to and at least tries {{to be strong and}} respectful.|$|E
50|$|A {{real estate}} {{developer}} (Eric Roberts) sells out his partner in order to clear the path {{for the construction of}} a hotel in the Malibu hills. However he slowly discovers that all <b>those</b> <b>he's</b> plotting with to build the hotel may have recently escaped from local insane asylum.|$|R
50|$|In this he's {{aided by}} Neesha, a bewildered refugee from a war-torn planet, and Klux, a {{powerful}} but unintelligent engine of destruction. Kipling discovered {{he is the}} pawn of an unnamed god who is presumably more powerful than <b>those</b> <b>he's</b> seen before and probably the one who brought him back.|$|R
50|$|Among <b>those</b> <b>he's</b> interviewed are musical heavyweights Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins, Guns n' Roses, Heart, and Red Hot Chili Peppers; {{best-selling author}} Chuck Palahniuk; adult film star Jesse Jane; and comedy superstars Gabriel Iglesias, Margaret Cho, Dane Cook, and Demetri Martin. Tanamor also has covered President Obama {{when he spoke}} at Alcoa Davenport Works.|$|R
5|$|Several writers {{anticipated}} evolutionary {{aspects of}} Darwin's theory, {{and in the}} third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861 Darwin named <b>those</b> <b>he</b> knew about in an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species, which he expanded in later editions.|$|E
5|$|Upon his accession, Edward became {{sovereign}} of {{the various}} orders of the British Commonwealth and Empire, including <b>those</b> <b>he</b> had been appointed to prior to becoming king. After his abdication, the King, Edward's brother, reinstated his pre-accession honours.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in <b>those</b> <b>he</b> assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5000|$|Anubis is a {{featured}} {{character and}} a romance {{option in the}} otome game Kamigami no Asobi, where he is portrayed as a crafty but shy, young, dark skinned man with the ears of a jackal and black [...] "stains" [...] (from the sins of <b>those</b> <b>he's</b> helped pass on) on his arms and legs.|$|R

5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against <b>those</b> <b>he</b> perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Butler wrote a {{book titled}} War Is a Racket, where he {{described}} and criticized {{the workings of the}} United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as <b>those</b> <b>he</b> was a part of, including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and <b>those</b> <b>he</b> opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to <b>those</b> <b>he</b> saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food {{coming down from the}} leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E
5|$|Narayan is {{associated}} with the Kirana gharana (stylistic school of Kirana) through Abdul Wahid Khan, but his performance style is not strongly connected to it. Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the sarangi. He has created original compositions and in performance varies <b>those</b> <b>he</b> was taught. Narayan disfavors the creation of new ragas, but developed compound ragas, including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar.|$|E
5|$|Season 6, set 20 months later, {{begins at}} 6:00a.m. Jack is {{released}} after being detained in a Chinese prison following {{the events of}} Season 5. Terrorists who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off suitcase nuclear devices in America. Later, Jack is {{forced to choose between}} <b>those</b> <b>he</b> loves and national security when the Chinese set their sights on sensitive circuitry that could trigger a war between the U.S. and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire <b>those</b> <b>he</b> ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Atemengue {{was made}} {{chief of the}} local court, and Atangana was again {{appointed}} paramount chief (chef supérieur). He received {{a seat on the}} Council of Notables, a body the French had introduced to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration. Atangana set up a cabinet based on <b>those</b> <b>he</b> had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against <b>those</b> <b>he</b> considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
