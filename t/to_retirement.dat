Prior <b>to</b> <b>retirement,</b> the last major missions were flown during the 2010–11 Queensland floods, in which Sea Kings provided SAR coverage of the region and delivered aid relief to citizens in the flooded areas.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2016–17 season, Parker lost {{longtime}} teammate Tim Duncan <b>to</b> <b>retirement.</b> The Spurs finished {{the season with}} a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left quadriceps tendon that will preclude his return to the playoffs and may miss eight months. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio's first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker.|$|E
5|$|Hughes faced BJ Penn on November 20, 2010, in {{a rubber}} match at , after their {{previous}} two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn came out {{strong in the}} first few seconds of the opening round, catching one of Hughes' kicks and knocking him off balance with a counter hook. Penn then connected with an overhand right that dropped Hughes, following up with three clean shots to the jaw. The bout was ended at 21 seconds into the first round, with Hughes trilogy against Penn ending at 1-2. The fight marked the first time Hughes had been knocked out (he had previously lost via technical knockout). Post-fight Hughes hinted that the loss moved him one step closer <b>to</b> <b>retirement.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close <b>to</b> <b>retirement.</b> The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the Russian Superleague, contracted hepatitis A. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens <b>to</b> <b>retirement,</b> Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced that head coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} in little more than a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson <b>to</b> <b>retirement.</b> Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E

3000|$|As {{it can be}} seen in columns 2 a and 2 b of Table  2, each {{measure of}} SSW has a {{significant}} positive impact on its own hazard rate while a significant negative impact on the hazard rate of the alternative risk. Particularly, the SSW in case of full retirement (SSW F [...]) has a positive effect on the hazard rate <b>to</b> full <b>retirement</b> that lessens over time, while a negative one on the hazard rate <b>to</b> partial <b>retirement.</b> The SSW P [...] has a positive impact on the hazard rate <b>to</b> partial <b>retirement</b> while a negative one, that lessens over time, on the hazard rate <b>to</b> full <b>retirement.</b> The estimators all have the expected sign and are statistically significant. An increase in SSW could be interpreted as a wealth effect, so as an incentive to increase the consumption of leisure, which requires retiring earlier. It is interesting to notice the negative sign that each measure of SSW has on the alternative exit route. We could interpret this finding in the following sense: if partial pensions are favoured, and hence SSW P [...] is increased, this will imply a reduction on the hazard rate <b>to</b> full <b>retirement</b> and a rise on the hazard rate <b>to</b> partial <b>retirement,</b> other things equal.|$|R

40|$|In last 20 years {{studies on}} {{athletic}} retirement have increased. In earlier days, many athletic retirement studies {{were derived from}} sociological models or theories (e. g. social gerontology theories or thanatological models). But, {{it became apparent that}} they were not adaptable <b>to</b> athletic <b>retirement</b> because they were not based on comprehensive perspectives. Therefore, athletic retirement studies have developed into having life-span development perspectives, in which athletic retirement is considered as a process and one of the transitions in life. Recently, the importance of preventive and educational intervention has been discussed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review several issues related <b>to</b> athletic <b>retirement.</b> First, we present the trend of athletic retirement studies. Second, we describe various theories and models related <b>to</b> athletic <b>retirement.</b> Third, we consider the reasons for athletic retirement, and describe various reactions <b>to</b> athletic <b>retirement.</b> Furthermore, we present factors that influence adjustment <b>to</b> athletic <b>retirement</b> and describe how to prevent and cope with it, and sport psychological assistance for athletes (e. g. career assistance programs). Finally, we offer future directions for athletic retirement studies...|$|R
