5|$|Ticket sales {{began in}} September 2014. The Games {{expected}} to have 1.4million tickets for sale, with over 75% of them priced under $45. The first <b>tranche</b> of tickets was to be allocated via a lottery system. Over one million tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>tranche</b> of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the corporate and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer2011. The {{total cost of the}} work was estimated to be £7.6million.|$|E
5|$|Once steel {{supplies}} {{had been}} agreed, an initial <b>tranche</b> of $35 million in funding {{was provided by}} the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which owned and manage the operation of the pipelines through its subsidiary organizations, the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations. In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|The first {{enlisted men}} to be {{recruited}} in 1873 came {{from a wide variety}} of backgrounds, but most had some military experience. Many of the men enlisting in this <b>tranche</b> were later dismissed as unsuitable for service, less than half completing their term of enlistment, and more care was taken in later recruiting. Initially, a majority of the force were of Canadian origin but the number originating from Britain rose steadily during the 1880s until they made up over half of all new recruits, with British-born mounted police also tending to predominate in the non-commissioned cadre, mainly because they chose to stay longer in the force. Although the number of Canadian-born recruits increased for a while, the economic boom of the 1910s made the task much harder, and the mounted police opened a recruitment office in London; by 1914 almost 80 percent of the force had been born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first <b>tranche</b> of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E

25|$|Securitizations {{are often}} {{structured}} as a sequential pay bond, {{paid off in}} a sequential manner based on maturity. This means that the first <b>tranche,</b> which may have a one-year average life, will receive all principal payments until it is retired; then the second <b>tranche</b> begins to receive principal, and so forth. Pro rata bond structures pay each <b>tranche</b> a proportionate share of principal throughout {{the life of the}} security.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tranche</b> 1 {{aircraft}} {{were produced}} from 2000 onwards. Aircraft capabilities are being increased incrementally, with each software upgrade {{resulting in a}} different standard, known as blocks. With {{the introduction of the}} block 5 standard, the R2 retrofit programme began to bring all <b>Tranche</b> 1 aircraft to that standard.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is {{expected}} to sell a dual-tranche sovereign bond worth $750 million on 23 March 2006 that analysts said should ensure a favourable reception in the bond market. The 10-year <b>tranche</b> would be $500 million and the 30-year portion $250 million. Pricing {{is expected}} during New York trading hours on 23 March 2006. The sources said that the 10-year <b>tranche</b> {{was expected to be}} priced at around 100125%, while the longer-dated <b>tranche</b> was expected to be sold at around 70.875%, the top end of the indicative yield range of 3.75 to 10.875%.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, {{the plan to}} recapitalize the bank for €5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to {{securitize}} the entire bad loan portfolio for a target of €9.2 billion, which had a net book value of €10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior <b>tranche</b> would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine <b>tranche</b> would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine <b>tranche</b> for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market {{with some of them}} being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine <b>tranche</b> (for €1.171 billion) was added—to be underwritten by the bank itself.|$|E

25|$|Eurojet is {{attempting}} to find funding to test a thrust vectoring nozzle (TVN) on a flight demonstrator. Additionally, the RAF has sought to develop conformal fuel tanks (CFT) for their Typhoons to free up underwing space for weapons, and all <b>Tranche</b> 3 aircraft are fitted to accept these tanks. On 22 April 2014, BAE systems announced {{a new round of}} wind tunnel tests to assess the aerodynamic characteristics of conformal fuel tanks (CFTs). The CFTs, which can be fitted to any <b>Tranche</b> 2/3 aircraft, can carry 1,500 litres each to increase the Typhoon's combat radius by a factor of 25% to 1,500 n miles (2,778km).|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 2002 the Austrian {{government}} announced {{its decision to}} buy the Typhoon as its new air defence aircraft, it having beaten the General Dynamics F-16 and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in competition. The purchase of 18 Typhoons was agreed on 1 July 2003, and included training, logistics, maintenance and a simulator. On 26 June 2007 Austrian Minister for Defense Norbert Darabos announced a reduction to 15 aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered on 12 July 2007 and formally entered service in the Austrian Air Force. A 2008 report by the Austrian government oversight office, the Rechnungshof, calculated that instead of getting 18 <b>Tranche</b> 2 jets at a price of €109 million each, as stipulated by the original contract, the revised deal agreed by Minister Darabos meant that Austria was paying an increased unit price of €114 million for 15 partially used, <b>Tranche</b> 1 jets.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 2013 Spain {{announced}} a proposed sale of 18 <b>Tranche</b> 1 aircraft to the Peruvian Air Force, at a reported value of €45 million each.

Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second <b>tranche</b> of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms {{have yet to be}} progressed.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, Finmeccanica (Leonardo from 2017) {{demonstrated}} the air-to-ground capabilities of its Mode 5 Reverse-Identification Friend-Foe (IFF) system integrated on an Italian Air Force <b>Tranche</b> 1 Eurofighter Typhoon. This demonstration {{shows that it}} is possible to give pilots the ability to distinguish between friendly and enemy platforms in a simple, low-impact fashion using the aircraft’s existing transponder. Finmeccanica says NATO is considering the system as a short- to mid-term solution for air-to-surface identification of friendly forces and thus avoid collateral damages due to friendly fire during close air support operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the Eurofighter {{prototype}} took place in Bavaria on 27 March 1994, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. On 9 December 2004, Eurofighter Typhoon IPA4 began three months of Cold Environmental Trials (CET) at the Vidsel Air Base in Sweden, the purpose of which was to verify the operational behaviour of the aircraft and its systems in temperatures between −25 and 31°C. The maiden flight of Instrumented Production Aircraft 7 (IPA7), the first fully equipped <b>Tranche</b> 2 aircraft, took place from EADS' Manching airfield on 16 January 2008.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{prosecutors}} are investigating allegations {{that up to}} €100 million was made available to lobbyists to influence the original purchase decision in favour of the Eurofighter. By October 2013, all Typhoons in service with Austria had been upgraded to the latest <b>Tranche</b> 1 standard. In 2014, due to defense budget restrictions, there were only 12 pilots available to fly the 15 aircraft in Austria's Air Force. In February 2017, Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil accused Airbus of fraudulent intent following a probe that allegedly unveiled corruption linked {{to the order of}} Typhoon jets.|$|E
25|$|The Passive Infra-Red Airborne Track Equipment (PIRATE) {{system is}} an {{infrared}} search and track (IRST) system {{mounted on the}} port side of the fuselage, forward of the windscreen. Selex ES is the lead contractor which, along with Thales Optronics (system technical authority) and Tecnobit of Spain, make up the EUROFIRST consortium responsible for the system's design and development. Eurofighters starting with <b>Tranche</b> 1 block 5 have the PIRATE. The first Eurofighter Typhoon with PIRATE-IRST was delivered to the Italian Aeronautica Militare in August 2007. More advanced targeting capabilities can be provided {{with the addition of a}} targeting pod such as the LITENING pod.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{was one of}} {{the areas}} in the first <b>tranche</b> of reviews {{conducted}} by the Banham Commission. The Commission's final recommendations, accepted by the government, were that each of the districts should be made a unitary authority, and additionally that the Tees should be re-established as a ceremonial border. This was fiercely contested by Cleveland County Council, who applied for judicial review over the decision. According to the Minister, David Curry, in the Commons debate on the order on 11 January 1995, this caused a delay from 1 April 1995 as the reorganisation date to 1 April 1996.|$|E
25|$|Dennis DesRosiers {{estimated}} that GM {{will go through}} its government loans {{in a couple of}} quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP Frank Valeriote that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the U.S. government in order to secure the first <b>tranche</b> of a US$30 billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers' Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.|$|E
