The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E

An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E

500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War.

What do you think of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by {{the pressures of the}} Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

500|$|Thief began {{development}} in April 1996. For the game's original designer and writer Ken Levine, credited by The Telegraph as [...] "a {{key figure in}} the creation" [...] of Thief, inspirations came from two of his favourite games, Castle Wolfenstein and Diablo. The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project, included School of Wizards, Dark Elves Must Die and Better Red Than Undead, the latter of which was [...] "a campy story" [...] about communist zombies. The game {{was supposed to be}} a first-person sword fighting simulator, but [...] "the marketing [...] killed the idea," [...] to his disappointment. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, [...] "The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead, a '50s Cold War game where <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don't work on the undead." [...] Doug Church said the game's design was built around the idea [...] "of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or do things for or not." ...|$|E
500|$|German Claudia Pechstein has won nine medals—five gold, two silver, and two bronze—more {{than any}} other speed skater at the Olympics.

At the 1924 Winter Olympics, Finn Clas Thunberg became the first athlete to win two or more gold medals; in 1928, he became the first speed skater to successfully defend an Olympic title. At the 1964 Games, Skoblikova won four gold medals and became the first athlete to win a gold in every available event. [...] The feat was repeated in 1980 by American Eric Heiden, who won five golds, the most that any Winter Olympian has won at one edition of the Games. In 2006, Canadian Cindy Klassen became the only other speed skater, and one of seven Winter Olympians, to win five medals—one gold, two silver, two bronze—at a single edition of the Games. Pechstein and American Bonnie Blair are the only speed skaters to win gold in the same event three times in a row. Andrea Schöne, who won a silver medal in 1976, is the youngest female athlete in an individual event to win a medal. German Christa Luding-Rothenburger and Canadian Clara Hughes are the only medal-winning speed skaters who have also won a medal at the Summer Olympic Games, having won medals in cycling.|$|E
