25|$|Stanley Allen McChrystal (born August 14, 1954) is {{a retired}} United States Army general {{best known for his}} command of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the mid-2000s. His last {{assignment}} was as Commander, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A). He previously served as Director, Joint Staff from August 2008 to June 2009 and as Commander of JSOC from 2003 to 2008, where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but also criticized for his alleged role in the cover-up of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident. McChrystal was reportedly known for saying and <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> other military leaders were afraid to; {{this was one of the}} reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan. He held the post from June 15, 2009, to June 23, 2010.|$|E
25|$|I {{could not}} help <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> a feeble and futile effort to keep down Jacobinism this bill must be, when compar'd with the effect to be produc'd by all the {{consequences}} arising from compromising with its existence under color of a peace with the Nation—what {{is to be done}} with all their Coms Ambassadors, Consuls, and Citizens? Are they to range at large, in every town and every house, preaching their doctrines, and perhaps even buying proselytes?—are Englishmen to be sent to Paris to be witnesses of the successful result of audacious usurpation, and of the elevation of Tom Paine, from a Staymaker to a fine Gentleman, from an Exciseman to a Sovereign, as the reward of the Rights of Man and the Age of Reason—I fear Restriction and Coercion will avail little against the influence of example—but our Ministers have made up their minds, to save Jacobinism, at its last gasp, and the experiment of shaking hands with it...|$|E
25|$|Sunnis {{believe that}} Abu Bakr is the {{rightful}} Caliph. The Twelver Shia and the Ismaili Shia believe that Ali {{should have been}} the first Caliph. Their main argument is based on their interpretation of Hadith of the pond of Khumm. However, later a minority, took this concept one step further and also started <b>thinking,</b> <b>what</b> if history took a different course and these ideas were later adopted by some Twelver Shia and institutionalised by the Safavids in the 1500s. For {{the first time in the}} history of Islam, the Safavids also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and funded this hierarchy through the collection of waqf and Khums. Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called vaqf. They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama the quasi-religious organizations run by dervishes (futuvva). Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the mujtahids and the seyyeds, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian Iskandar Munshi, Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners. From then on many seyyeds also further propagated the idea that Ali {{should have been the}} first caliph and that by becoming the first caliph, Abu Bakr had broken the link that proved that they should have more rights. Before that point Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph.|$|E

500|$|For his stylistic {{influences}} {{for playing}} drums, Mark references Stewart Copeland of The Police who he [...] "always thought ... {{had a really}} good style", Neil Peart of Rush, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, and Keith Moon of The Who. Following the release of The Fiction We Live, then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album (Abandon Your Friends) would feature lyrics that were inspired by Billy Joel, stating that they were [...] "billyjoelesque" [...] because [...] "they’re more straightforward, not what I’m <b>thinking,</b> <b>what</b> I’m feeling, instead of poetry and shit". However, it is unclear whether the lyrics were used on the album, as was revealed by Mark in 2007, that Perri had not contributed to Abandon Your Friends and it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|All That Glitters was series creator Norman Lear's {{attempt to}} {{duplicate}} his {{success with the}} syndicated soap opera spoof Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Lear described the premise simply: [...] "God created Eve first, took out her rib {{and gave her a}} companion so she wouldn't be lonely." [...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And I thought there was a series in it—a five-times-a-week series: I went to bed thinking about that, and I woke up the next morning <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> would happen if the male-female equation were changed? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E

500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept <b>thinking,</b> <b>what</b> if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E

2500|$|Under Howard's {{leadership}} in the 2005 general election, the Conservative Party increased their total vote share by around 0.7% (up to 32.4%) and–more significantly–their number of parliamentary seats by 33 (up to 198 seats). This gain accompanied a large decline in the Labour vote, and the election reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 68 and {{its share of the}} vote to 35.2%. The campaign, based on the slogan [...] "Are you <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> we're thinking?", was designed by Australian pollster Lynton Crosby. The day following the election, on 6 May, Howard announced that he did not feel it was right to continue as leader after defeat in the general election, also saying that he would be too old to lead the party into another campaign and would therefore step down after allowing time for the party to amend its leadership election rules.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1972, Englehart and writers Gerry Conway and Len Wein crafted a metafictional {{unofficial}} crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein's first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, [...] "It certainly seemed like a radical concept {{and we knew that}} we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It's really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back — it didn't matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel — I think it was us being creative, <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> would be really cool to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} Final Fantasy VIIs world {{was for a}} fully modern setting, but after the project moved from the 2D Super Nintendo Entertainment System to development for the PlayStation console, the setting altered with it. Elements from the original concept were later used in Final Fantasy VIII and Parasite Eve. The game's producer, Hironobu Sakaguchi, chose character designer Tetsuya Nomura to create the main cast. Nomura had previously worked on monster designs for Final Fantasy VI. Sakaguchi chose Nomura after being amused by the way Nomura did the storyboarding for the cutscenes. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by <b>thinking</b> <b>what</b> kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper." [...] Nomura also created Zack Fair, who was a late addition to the cast meant to add depth to Cloud and Aerith's relationship, and came up with the name for Red XIII, wanting an [...] "interesting" [...] name that combined a color and a number. Although the game was Nomura's favorite Final Fantasy project, he felt that it was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his [...] "true" [...] style.|$|E
