5|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the United States, Who Wants <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Millionaire</b> has been credited with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.

5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Millionaire?</b> had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the week}} of episodes from 16 to 20 July, Kat's lover rents a flat for them to share. Inside Soap {{wondered}} {{if this was the}} biggest clue so far, saying it suggests he has access to money, because flats in London are not cheap. They said it might seem familiar, as Max has rented flats before for his lovers Stacey (when cheating on Tanya), and Tanya (when cheating on Vanessa Gold (Zöe Lucker)). They said Derek also [...] "wouldn't think twice about flashing his cash" [...] and opined that Jack would probably <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> afford it as well. They said viewers do not know enough about Ray yet but he would probably not <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> afford it with his job as a pub chef, and Michael, although forced to steal from Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) to pay for his wedding, <b>is</b> married <b>to</b> Janine, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>millionaire.</b> Kate White from Inside Soap later opined that Michael would <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> get the money for the flat as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement. In relation to the flat, Soaplife focussed on Ray following the dance between him and Kat, and thought that if it was him, then he <b>is</b> [...] "either <b>a</b> secret millionnaire or EastEnders hasn't thought this one through." [...] Soaplife also used this to rule Jack out, as he has his own flat and would not need to rent one.|$|R

He had worked at a number of marine stations as a graduate student [...] at Alexander Agassiz's laboratory at Newport and at the Stazione Zoologica and other European stations during his 1894 post doctoral year in Europe. As early as 1892, Ritter quietly began to contact a number of wealthy businessmen in the San Francisco region {{to see if he could}} find funds to make his dream a reality. The economic panic of 1893 limited his prospects in San Francisco, so he then turned to Los Angeles and E. H. Harriman. Ritter <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the Harriman Alaska Expedition of 1899, but ultimately Harriman declined to support Ritter's station.
