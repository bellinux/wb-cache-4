40|$|The {{original}} {{idea of using}} a trench for the storing of ensilage {{seems to have been}} the outgrowth of the practice long used in several European countries of storing clover and beet tops in pits. Shortly after the World War, western Canada followed by Montana and North Dakota began to use the <b>trench</b> <b>silo.</b> In Nebraska the true <b>trench</b> <b>silo</b> made its appearance about 1925 or 1926. The <b>trench</b> <b>silo</b> as described in this circular, unless lined with some permanent material such as brick, concrete or stone, must be considered a temporary structure which will serve for a few years only and then must be discarded or rebuilt. In an emergency it will save a crop even though the farmer has little capital to expend other than his own labor...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of storage duration on nutrient composition and silage quality parameters. Corn was used as silage material. Corn (31. 41 % dry matter) was harvested at the dough stage and fermented for 90, 104, 118, 132, 146, 160, 174, 188 and 202 days in three <b>trench</b> <b>silos.</b> The samples were brought to laboratory every 14 days. This process was repeated 9 times. After the 132 th day, whereas silage crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash and crude fiber (CF) contents decreased, nitrogen free extract (NFE) content increased. Lactic acid concentration of corn silage increased until the 118 th day but decreased between the 118 th and the 160 th days. On the contrary, of decrease in LA concentration, acetic acid concentration increased depending on storage time. Ammonia nitrogen and CO 2 concentration of silage increased decreased with progressing time. Storage time had significant influence on Flieg scores. The lowest score was found between days the 104 th- 118 th. In this research, it was observed that there was a change in silage nutrient contents and fermentation characteristics with increasing storage time...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a chronic}} {{shortage}} of local feeds in Kuwait, and almost 95 % of total feeds are expensively imported. Therefore, efforts were focused {{to explore the}} possible utilization of locally available landscape browse resi-dues as feed ingredients. Landscape greenery residues have increased with locally implemented greenery programs. Conocarpus lancifolius is an ornamentally predominant tree among landscape plantations, daily resulting in over 120 t of residual by-products without being utilized. Ensiling, was considered as a techni-cally sound strategy for proper utilization of Conocarpus residues as an upgraded feed ingredient substituting imported conventional feeds. A total premix of 24 t of silage was prepared in pilot-scale <b>trench</b> <b>silos</b> for 30 days. Nutritional value of Conocarpus silage was evaluated, where mean values of 4. 2 ± 0. 12, 4. 95 ± 0. 32 %, and 7. 3 × 108 ± 0. 12 colony forming units (CFU) /g of silage for pH, lactic acid, and lactic acid bacteria were achieved, respectively. Palatability and feeding trials were performed for four months on 60 growing heifers of Holstein–Friesian breed grouped in six dietary treatments. Formulated feed rations contained 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 % silage partially replacing conventional roughages (alfalfa, hay straw). Control dietary treatment contained 100 % conventional feed ingredients. Daily dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio were signifi cantly (p> 0. 05) high. Results showed that grossly 40 % of the conventional roughages could {{be replaced by the}} ensile...|$|R
40|$|Results at Kansas State University {{from over}} 200 laboratory-scale trials and 28 farmscale trials showed that {{bacterial}} inoculants consistently improved preservation efficiency and nutritive {{value of the}} ensiled material. In contrast, anhydrous ammonia or urea adversely affected dry matter recovery and production per ton of crop ensiled. Economic analysis also favored the use of bacterial inoculants over nonprotein-nitrogen additives. Research conducted using corn, sorghum, and alfalfa silages showed that sealing the exposed surface dramatically reduced top spoilage losses in bunker, <b>trench,</b> or stack <b>silos...</b>|$|R
40|$|Arching is an {{important}} phenomenon {{that has to be}} understood when designing backfilled <b>trenches,</b> storage <b>silos</b> and underground mine stopes supporting granular materials. Here, a significant fraction of the fill load is carried by the wall friction and hence the load transferred {{to the bottom of the}} fill is substantially reduced. The objective of this paper is to present three different approaches, namely, analytical, experimental and numerical, to study the vertical normal stresses within a granular material contained between vertical walls. The laboratory model discussed herein is an effective tool in deriving the variation of shear stress on the wall and the average normal stresses with depth. It is shown that the analytical and numerical models that treat the granular material as a continuum suggest an asymptotic vertical normal stress that is reached at certain depths, whereas the laboratory model tests show that the vertical stresses increase continuously even at very large depths...|$|R
25|$|When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the alfalfa is chopped finely and {{fermented}} in <b>silos,</b> <b>trenches,</b> or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay. In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the best}} quality silage ever made has come from round bales sealed in plastic. On the other hand, {{some of the worst}} silage that I have ever seen {{likewise}} came from round bales in plastic. These extremes in quality are related to procedural techniques for putting up round bale silage and problems that can occur during storage. If proper techniques are followed, excellent quality silage can be produced, especially from late summer and fall cuttings. But if bales are not managed properly, it can be a disaster resulting in total loss of the silage. It may be easier to preserve hay crop silage in upright, <b>trench</b> and bunker <b>silos</b> than in large bales sealed in plastic. Plastic is much more susceptible to air leaks and oxygen infiltration than concrete or steel, so the ease of maintaining an oxygen-free storage environment is much less for bales surrounded by plastic than for conventional silos. The round bale silage system, sometimes referred to as `balage', has a number of advantages over hay and conventional silage systems: 1. Substantially reduces the risk of weather damage to the forage compared with a hay system. 2. Provides flexibility as the baler can be used for both hay and silage. Main attraction of large round bales is the ease an...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Observations {{were made}} on silage pH, {{chemical}} composition and 24 hr in vitro dry matter digestion (IVDMD) to evaluate effects of various additives ensiled with annual ryegrass straw. Additives were compared in factorial designed trials utilizing. 95 1 glass jar silos. Selection of additives used in each subsequent trial was based on results of preceding trials and then combined with other additives. All additives were used {{as a percent of}} straw on a dry matter basis and incorporated with water to give 22 % dry matter in silages. Adding 4. 5 % NaOH:KOH allowed greater (P<. 01) silage IVDMD than. 5 g cellulase while this gave more (P<. 01) IVDMD than straw ensiled with water. Including 10 % and 20 % molasses lowered (P<. 01) silage pH to more desirable levels, with or without the other additives. Using 20 % molasses resulted in more favorable silage aspects and the lowest (P <. 01) acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and cell wall constituents (CWC) for the silage. Adding 1 % urea to silage having 20 % molasses or 4. 5 % hydroxide and 20 % molasses increased (P<. 01) crude protein content and IVDMD. Adding 1. 2 % biuret to these silages raised (P<. 01) crude protein but did not affect IVDMD. Including. 1 % elemental sulfur raised (P< 01) silage pH and a strong sulfur odor was present. Some spoilage occurred when sulfur was added to hydrooxide- treated ensilage and was more evident in material containing urea. Reduced (P<. 01) ADF and CWC values were observed in hydroxide silage having sulfur-biuret additives. Silage with 20 % molasses and 1 % urea had a lower (P<. 01) pH at 40 days than at 20 days ensilation. Adding. 5 % limestone lowered (P<. 01) pH further and improved (P<. 01) IVDMD at 40 days ensilation. Ensilage having 4. 5 % hydroxide and the same molasses and urea additives resulted in a more elevated (P<. 01) p 11 at 40 days. The addition of limestone to these additives lowered (P<. 01) silage pH while IVDMD was unaltered. Using. 5 % formic acid in these silages lowered (P<. 01) pH while not affecting IVDMD. All silages had less (P<. 01) residual ash at 40 days than at 20 days ensilation. Ensiling straw with 20 % molasses, 1 % urea and. 5 % limestone gave lower (P<. 01) pH values than for hydroxide-treated silage having the other additives at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 days ensilation. Decreased (P<. 01) ADF and CWC and increased (P<. 01) ADL values occurred in treated silage several days earlier (P<. 01) than untreated ensilage. Less (P<. 01) residual ash remained in either type silage after 32 days ensiling. Formation of organic acids during the 0 - 64 days ensiling by hydroxide-treated material gave peak (P<. 01) lactic acid at 16 days then dropped (P< 01) while acetic plateaued (P<. 01) at 16 days and butyric rose (P<. 01) sharply after 16 days. In contrast, untreated silage had a steady rise (P<. 01) of lactic to 64 days, acetic peaked (P<. 01) at 32 days, while butyric rose (P<. 01) at 8 days and declined at 32 days. Propionic acid was not detectable in untreated sila. ge after 2 days ensilation while rises (P<. 01) occurred at 2 and 32 days in treated material. IVDMD was higher (P<. 01) with 2 - 64 day substrate from treated silage while digestion for untreated was increased after substrate had been ensiled for 32 days. In vitro rumen liquor following 24 hr fermentation of hydroxide-treated silage allowed greater (P<. 01) concentrations of acetate and butyrate than untreated silage while numerical differences for propionate were not significant. Lambs consumed more (P<. 05) dry matter and nitrogen from silage prepared in plastic barrels with 4. 5 % NaOH:KOH, 20 % molasses, 1 % urea and. 5 % limestone as compared to ensilage having these additives except hydroxide. Material ensiled with hydroxide resulted in higher (P<. 05) digestibility of dry and organic matter, ADF, ADL, CWC and crude protein. Also more (P<. 05) nitrogen was retained while urine volume and density was greater numerically. Rumen fluid of these lambs contained more (P<. 05) acetic and propionic acids while butyric acid and C₂:C₃ ratio were not significantly different. Body weight gains during a 98 day trial were similar in heifers fed ryegrass silage, or straw ensiled with the molasses, urea, limestone and hydroxide additives, or the same straw silage without hydroxide when animals each received. 9 kg barleycottonseed meal supplement daily. Supplementing these silages with an equal amount of fat-molasses-urea mixture reduced (P<. 05) gains and silage intake was depressed. An additional daily. 9 kg grain supplement during the final 38 days of the trial stimulated intake of either type straw silage while consumption of ryegrass ensilage was lowered. Animals consumed the straw silage having hydroxide more readily than the untreated straw ensilage throughout the trial. Dry matter of these silages were 37 and 40 %, respectively, and little spoilage was evident following 60 days ensilation in plastic lined <b>trench</b> <b>silos...</b>|$|R
