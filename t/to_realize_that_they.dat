5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles of communal representation, which led the Tamils <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the minority ethnic group {{and that they should}} be represented by a member of their own community. It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area began <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could live there full-time and commute to their jobs in the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing {{the total amount of}} land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} divided into eight books, or parts, {{each with its own}} subchapters. Book one opens with the story of the three Magi, who arrive in Bethlehem to hear the news of Christ’s birth. Readers meet the fictional {{character}} of Judah {{for the first time in}} book two, when his childhood friend Messala, also a fictional character, returns to Jerusalem as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The teen-aged boys come <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have changed and hold very different views and aspirations. When a loose tile is accidentally dislodged from the roof of Judah's house during a military parade and strikes the Roman governor, knocking him from his horse, Messala falsely accuses Judah of attempted assassination. Although Judah is not guilty and receives no trial, he is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned in a Roman jail, where they contract leprosy; and all the family property is confiscated. Judah first encounters Jesus, who offers him a drink of water and encouragement, as Judah is being marched to a galley to be a slave. Their lives continue to intersect as the story unfolds.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make South African courts more just in their convictions, the concept of extenuating {{circumstances}} came into being. However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the justice system. Examples include: deindividuation, bystander apathy, and conformity. In the case of S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989) eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology. Social anthropologist Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that bystander apathy, deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.|$|E

50|$|Locust Valley Cemetery is a private, non-denominational {{memorial}} {{that began}} with a unique plan more than 100 years ago. Rather than the usual rows of marble and granite, the cemetery's 19th-century founders conceived of a sanctuary akin to a woodland garden. <b>To</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> vision, <b>they</b> commissioned the Olmsted Brothers to design its grounds. They were the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, renowned architect of Central Park.|$|R
25|$|Wright {{arrived to}} meet with the tribes three days later and {{negotiated}} a peace treaty, to which the Coeur d’Alene’s and the other tribes agreed <b>to,</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be able to}} defeat the United States troops. The treaty required that the Coeur d’Alene return army property and hand over the individuals responsible for the attack on Steptoe, and give permission for whites to pass through their lands without interference in the future. In return, Wright promised that there would be no more war waged against the Coeur d’Alene people. The tribes turned over those who were responsible, including Qualchan, who had been one of the main leaders throughout, and they were hanged at Latah Creek. Wright's actions opened the mountain valley of the Pacific Northwest to settlement by whites, and forced the tribes onto reservations that consisted of only a fraction of their former lands, where they were quickly struck by disease and malnutrition as a result.|$|R
25|$|Their {{preliminary}} versions used primitive art {{assets to}} allow them to focus on the game. This helped them <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out to bring her back to life, only <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Scully has {{discovered}} that the yellow substance mainly consists of organic material found in digestive juices, although it appears plant-like. Arriving at the field, Scully accidentally steps on another mushroom, and begins hallucinating. Scully and the coroner start to look for Mulder, only to find his skeletal remains. Back at the coroner's office, Scully identifies Mulder's remains from his dental records but finds no evidence of the secretion on the skeleton. Later, at Mulder's wake Mulder shows up, clearly alive. [...] Suddenly, the wake congregation disappears. As Mulder and Scully discuss what has happened, they both begin <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are still in the}} cave being digested by the substance while they are comatose; somehow, they are sharing the same hallucination.

2500|$|After {{the fervor}} {{of the early}} mass {{conversions}} in Mexico had subsided, Franciscan missionaries came <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed {{a better understanding of}} indigenous peoples in order effectively to pursue their work. Sahagún's life changed dramatically in 1558 when the new provincial of New Spain, Fray Francisco de Toral, commissioned him to write in Nahuatl about topics he considered useful for the missionary project. The provincial wanted Sahagún to formalize his study of native language and culture, so that he could share it with others. The priest had a free hand to conduct his investigations. [...] He conducted research for about twenty-five years, and spent the last fifteen or so editing, translating and copying. His field research activities can be grouped into an earlier period (1558–1561) and a later period (1561–1575).|$|E

2500|$|Although DRM is {{prevalent}} for Internet music, some online music {{stores such as}} eMusic, Dogmazic, Amazon, and Beatport, do not use DRM despite encouraging {{users to}} avoid sharing music.

2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to have}} to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E
