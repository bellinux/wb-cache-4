The DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index were administered within 5 working days of admission and discharge from the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program. Outcome measuresThe DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index. ResultsNeither the DEMMI nor the Modified Barthel Index had a floor or ceiling effect. Similar evidence of convergent, discriminant and known-groups validity were obtained for each instrument. The DEMMI was significantly more responsive to change than the Modified Barthel Index using criterion- and distribution-based methods. The minimum clinically important difference estimates represented similar proportions of the scale width for the DEMMI and Modified Barthel Index and were similar using criterion- and distribution-based estimates. Rasch analysis identified the DEMMI as essentially unidimensional in a <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program cohort and therefore can be applied to obtain interval level measurement.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the distribution of hospital and aged care services for older people, with a particular focus on <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places, across Australia and to determine the relationships between the provision of these services. METHODS: Aggregation of health and aged care service indicators by Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) region including: public and private acute and subacute (rehabilitation and geriatric evaluation and management) hospital beds, flexible and mainstream aged care places as at 30 June 2006. RESULTS: There was marked variation in the distribution of acute and subacute hospital beds among the 79 ACAT regions. Aged care places were more evenly distributed. However, the distribution of <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places was uneven. Rural areas had poorer provision of all beds. There was no evidence of coordination in the allocation of hospital and aged care services between the Commonwealth and state/territory governments. There was a weak relationship between the allocation of <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> places and the distribution of health and aged care services. DISCUSSION: Overall, the distribution of services available to older persons is uneven across Australia. While the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Program is flexible and is providing rural communities with access to rehabilitation, it will not be adequate to address the increasing needs associated with the ageing of the Australian population. An integrated national plan for aged care and rehabilitation services should be considered. Lynne C Giles, Julie A Halbert, Len C Gray, Ian D Cameron and Maria Crott...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Transitions</b> in <b>care</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and challenging client safety issues in healthcare. This project was undertaken to gain insight into the practice setting realities for nurses and other health care providers as they manage increasingly complex <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> across multiple settings. Methods. The Appreciative Inquiry approach was used to guide interviews with sixty-six healthcare providers from a variety of practice settings. Data was collected on participants’ experience of exceptional <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> and opportunities for improving <b>care</b> <b>transitions.</b> Results. Nurses and other healthcare providers need to know three things to ensure safe care transitions: (1) know your client; (2) know your team on both sides of the transfer; and (3) know the resources your client needs and how to get them. Three themes describe successful <b>care</b> <b>transitions,</b> including flexible structures; independence and teamwork; and client and provider focus. Conclusion. Nurses often operate at the margins of acceptable performance, and flexibility with regulation and standards is often required in complex sociotechnical work like <b>care</b> <b>transitions.</b> Priority needs to be given to creating conditions where nurses and other healthcare providers are free to creatively engage and respond in ways that will optimize safe <b>care</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, patient safety issues during <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> have gained greater {{attention}} {{at both the}} local and national level. Readmission rates to U.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for acute care services {{due in part to}} rising proportions of older people and increasing rates of chronic diseases. To reduce pressure and costs in the hospital system, community-based post-acute care discharge services for older people have evolved as one method of reducing length of stay in hospital and preventing readmissions. However, it is unclear whether they reduce overall episode cost or expenditure in the health system at a more general level. In this paper, we review the current evidence on the likely costs and benefits of these services and consider whether they are potentially cost-effective from a health services perspective, using the Australian <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme as a case study. Evaluations of community-based post-acute services have demonstrated that they reduce length of stay, prevent some re-hospitalisations and defer nursing home placement. There is also evidence that they convey some additional health benefits to older people. An economic model was developed to identify the maximum potential benefits and the likely cost savings from reduced use of health services from earlier discharge from hospital, accelerated recovery, reduced likelihood of readmission to hospital and delayed entry into permanent institutional care for participants of the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme. Assuming the best case scenario, the <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> Programme is still unlikely to be cost saving to a healthcare system. Hence for this service to be justified, additional health benefits such as quality of life improvements need to be taken into account. If it can be demonstrated that this service also conveys additional quality of life improvements, community-based programmes such as <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> could be considered to be cost-effective when compared with other healthcare programmes.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore, via {{empirical}} comparison, the relationship between quality of life, as measured by the ICECAP-O capability index (a new instrument designed to measure and value quality of life in older people), with both self-reported health status and the quality of care transition in adults aged 65 and over participating in two post acute rehabilitation programs (outpatient day rehabilitation and the Australian National <b>Transition</b> <b>Care</b> residential program). Methods The ICECAP-O was administered to patients receiving either outpatient day rehabilitation (n[*]=[*] 53) or residential <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> (n[*]=[*] 29) during a face to face interview. The relationships between the ICECAP-O and other instruments, including the EQ- 5 D (a self-reported measure of health status) and CTM- 3 (a self-reported measure of the quality of care transitions), the type of post-acute care being received and socio-demographic characteristics were examined. Results The mean ICECAP-O score for the total sample was 0. 81 (SD: 0. 15). Patients receiving outpatient day rehabilitation generally reported higher levels of capability, than patients receiving residential <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> (mean 0. 82 [SD: 0. 15] and 0. 79 [SD: 0. 164] respectively), however these differences were not statistically significant. The mean EQ- 5 D score for the total sample was somewhat lower than the ICECAP-O (mean 0. 55; SD: 0. 27) indicating significant levels of health impairment with the outpatient day rehabilitation group demonstrating slightly higher levels of health status than the <b>transition</b> <b>care</b> group (mean 0. 54 [SD: 0. 254] and mean 0. 49 [SD: 0. 30]). The ICECAP-O was found to be positively correlated with both the CTM- 3 (Spearman’s r = 0. 234; p[*]≤[*] 0. 05) and the EQ- 5 D (Spearman’s r[*]=[*] 0. 437; p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). The relationships between the total EQ- 5 D and CTM- 3 scores and the individual attributes of the ICECAP-O indicate health status and quality of care transition in this patient population to be influential in some, but not all aspects of capability. Conclusions The correlations between the ICECAP-O, EQ- 5 D and CTM- 3 instruments illustrate that capability is strongly and positively associated with health-related quality of life and the quality of care transitions.

40|$|BACKGROUND With {{increasing}} regulations {{from the}} ACGME for resident work hours, {{the number of}} patient care hand-offs inevitably rises.

BACKGROUND: Communication at <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> in acute care settings can be complex and challenging, with important information about patients not always clearly transferred between responsible healthcare providers. Involving patients and their families in communication during <b>transitions</b> of <b>care</b> may improve the transfer of clinical information and patient outcomes and prevent adverse events during hospitalization and following discharge. Recently, optimizing patient and family participation during <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> has been acknowledged as central to the implementation of patient-centred care.

Inappropriate discontinuation (non-persistence) of evidence based therapies for chronic diseases places patients at an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Previous investigations have indicated that <b>care</b> <b>transitions</b> due to hospitalization have been associated with increased rates of non-persistence, and that non-persistent patients were at an increased risk for poor health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Care</b> <b>transition,</b> {{the process}} of moving from {{community}} care to residential care, {{is one of the}} biggest changes that older people can experience in their later life. Evidence from the literature suggests that older people's experiences of <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> tend to be negative and traumatic, with most of them being little involved in {{the process of}} <b>care</b> <b>transition.</b> How older people exercise choice during the period of <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> is important for understanding their experiences of <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> for the following two reasons: first, choice has been referred to in the literature as the key to less stressful <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> experiences, which can subsequently lead to a better quality of life in residential homes; second, the introduction of choice in public services has been the key plank of British social policy in recent decades and there has been a movement towards extending choice in residential care. This research aims to study older people's <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> experiences and their exercise of choice during the process of <b>care</b> <b>transition,</b> to explore the meaning and the perceived effects of choice and to identify the role of choice in promoting a positive <b>care</b> <b>transition.</b> This thesis presents findings from 48 in-depth interviews with older people who became new residents in one of the ten participating residential homes in London and had their care paid for by the local authority. This research identified four groups of older people who showed marked differences in terms of their needs, their exercise of choice during the <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> process and their adaptation to residential care: Active Planners, Conformists, the Unsettled and Shelter-Seekers. The findings from this research suggest that the older people's <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> experiences varied and that they stretch beyond the prevailing evidence emphasising the stressfulness of the <b>care</b> <b>transition.</b> The cases of Active Planners and Shelter-Seekers show the potential for positive roles for care homes in the case of users with genuine needs for residential care. An overwhelming majority of the older people who were interviewed were great proponents of choice and many of them actively exercised choice in the course of their <b>care</b> <b>transition.</b> This challenges the claim of the passivity of older people which has been argued in the literature. However, the cases of some Conformists who did not want to exercise choice also highlight that having no choice can be a choice for some older people. On the whole, older people’s exercise of choice played an important role in facilitating a positive transition, despite it not being a precondition for such a transition. However, there were administrative issues limiting the level and the extent of choice that were available to the older people and the Unsettled experienced an undesired move into a care home, having their choices denied or rejected. This thesis also questions the working of choice and competition in residential care, as the older people did not seem to enjoy the expected benefits of choice relating to service improvements which have been argued for in the literature. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{fragmented}} {{health care}} system leads to an increased demand for continuity of care across health care levels. Research indicates age-related differences during <b>care</b> <b>transition,</b> with the oldest patients having experiences and needs that {{differ from those of}} other patients. To meet the older patients’ needs and preferences during <b>care</b> <b>transition,</b> professionals must understand their experiences. Objective: The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore how patients 80 years of age, or older, experienced the <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> from hospital to municipal health care services. Methods: The study has a descriptive, explorative design, using semistructured interviews. Fourteen patients aged 80 or older participated in the study. Qualitative content analysis was used to describe the individuals’ experiences during <b>care</b> <b>transition.</b> Results: Two complementary themes emerged during the analysis: “Participation depends on being invited to plan the care transition” and “Managing continuity of care represents a complex and challenging process”. Discussion: Lack of participation, insufficient information, and vague responsibilities among staff during <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> seemed to limit the continuity of care. The patients are the vulnerable part of the <b>care</b> <b>transition</b> process, although they possess important resources, which illustrate the importance of making their voice heard. Older patients are therefore likely to benefit from more intensive support. A tailored, patient-centered follow-up of each patient is suggested to ensure that patient preferences and continuity of care to adhere to the new situation...|$|R
