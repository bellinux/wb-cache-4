5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance.

40|$|In this article, we {{extended}} <b>the</b> existing <b>explicit</b> Taylor {{method and}} modified it {{to gain a}} new explicit Taylor-liked method in solving stiff differential equations. We also considered the stability property for this method since the stability property of <b>the</b> classical <b>explicit</b> fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK 4) method is not adequate for the solution of stiff problems. Implicit methods could work well for stiff problems but have certain drawbacks especially when discussing about the cost. A comparison of the existing implicit Adam-Bashforth, <b>the</b> classical <b>explicit</b> (RK 4) and <b>the</b> new <b>explicit</b> Taylor-liked method is presented...|$|R

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most could relate to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan {{to form a}} {{new study}} group, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC), with <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> goal of {{developing}} a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, {{the decision was made to}} fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115. This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69mph, about ⅓ that of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} did {{not like}} the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming {{one of the most controversial}} and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. It is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 {{gave all}} of the Wahpeton and Sisseton Sioux (upper Sioux) lands west of the Mississippi River to the U.S. government.

Both treaties, however, were amended to during the ratification process to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> guarantees of lands retained by the tribes. Additionally much of the promised payments were never delivered in part ostensibly because of debts owed by the Sioux to the fur traders.|$|E

This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology.

25|$|The use of {{the term}} Ego in the Discourses does not follow the Freudian definition, {{although}} generally it refers to the same concept and many parallels can be drawn. Baba makes no mention of the Id or the Super-ego, but only the distinction between the implicit and <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> ego. The latter finds manifestation in consciousness, whereas the former remains in the subconscious mind. Isolated subconscious tendencies stored in the implicit ego must come to <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> side {{to take part in a}} conscious process. Yet <b>the</b> <b>explicit</b> ego is very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies.
