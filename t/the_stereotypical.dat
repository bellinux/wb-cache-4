5|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for The Simpsons ninth season, writer Donick Cary {{stated that}} {{the inspiration for the}} idea of an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time. Executive producer Mike Scully said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through the network censors. <b>The</b> <b>stereotypical</b> jokes were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand it was simply emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{restaurants}} and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> flock wallpaper and standardised menus. One {{of the pioneers}} was the Bombay Brasserie, which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India, and has remained fully booked ever since. It was followed in 1990 by Chutney Mary in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars {{for the quality of}} their cooking.|$|E

A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E

5|$|Born in Los Angeles to second-generation Chinese-American parents, Wong became {{infatuated}} with {{the movies and}} began acting in films at an early age. During the silent film era, she acted in The Toll of the Sea (1922), {{one of the first}} movies made in color and Douglas Fairbanks' The Thief of Bagdad (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> supporting roles she reluctantly played in Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them Piccadilly (1929). She spent {{the first half of the}} 1930s traveling between the United States and Europe for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, such as Daughter of the Dragon (1931) and Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express (1932).|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Super Columbine Massacre was {{enormously}} negative; {{the title was}} criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers {{and the lives of}} the innocent. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super Columbine Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing Columbine about his game and its impact.|$|E

5|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> {{portrayal}} of television angels, Castiel {{does not always}} help people, {{and is willing to}} kill innocents if needed. Collins originally read for the part of a demon, as series creator Eric Kripke did not want fans to find out that angels were being introduced to the series. Collins prepared for the role by reading the Book of Revelation, and based his portrayal on his younger brother. Critics and fans have responded highly favorably to the character. In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons. After being a special guest star in the seventh and eighth seasons, Collins was upgraded once again to regular cast member status for the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons.|$|E
5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to be different from <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E

25|$|He {{is perhaps}} the most {{influential}} character in films that explore archaeology. Since the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film's release, <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lacklustre professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure. Following 1981, <b>the</b> <b>stereotypical</b> archaeologist is thought of as a male bull whip wielding adventurer and Ivy League professor. <b>The</b> <b>stereotypical</b> image of an archaeologist is also portrayed as an individual usually out doing fieldwork, which is not always the case.|$|E
