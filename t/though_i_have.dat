500|$|The team {{struggled}} {{in their first}} season back in the top division, while Horsfield scored just three goals in 29 league appearances. His contribution {{on the final day}} of the season against Portsmouth however, proved vital to the club's survival. Coming on as a second-half substitute, he scored with his first touch, before setting up a goal for team mate Kieran Richardson. Combined with results from other matches, the 2–0 win ensured Albion's escape from relegation as the first club to survive in the Premier League after being bottom at Christmas. Horsfield said of the achievement, [...] "Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been promoted with every club I have been at this is the best moment of my career." ...|$|E

500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{never bought}} a slave and {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E
500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

Even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never attended Church, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never studied religion, I found that my perspective as a secularist and agnostic had become suddenly Christian. What's more, Catholic." ...|$|R

500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E

2500|$|According to Borlaug, [...] "Africa, {{the former}} Soviet republics, and the cerrado {{are the last}} frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no {{additional}} sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless {{you are willing to}} level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E

The resolution I moved in Dublin at the Confederation of Great Britain was at his request, upon a suggestion of my own.

I hope he will make a good fist of his answer to Butt, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never been persuaded that he shines as a letter-writer. Dan Crilly told me Parnell's first contribution to the Liverpool Argus (mentioned in my London letter) was not worth much, and though he promised to insert it, he has failed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Fox whispered {{that there}} was [...] "no loss of friendship". [...] "I regret to say there is", Burke replied, [...] "I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost my friend. There is {{something}} in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches". This provoked a reply from Fox, yet {{he was unable to}} give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered [...] "unusually bitter sarcasms". This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.|$|E
2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I think this is what happened to my books." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{his wife}} Jane's consent, Wells had affairs {{with a number}} of women, {{including}} the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger, adventurer and writer Odette Keun, Soviet spy Moura Budberg and novelist Elizabeth von Arnim. In 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society; and in 1914, a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells' [...] "sordid intrigue" [...] with the daughter of veteran Fabian Sidney Olivier, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. In Experiment in Autobiography (1934), Wells wrote: [...] "I was never a great amorist, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> loved several people very deeply".|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{had been}} working for Darwin, sending {{domestic}} fowl specimens from Indonesia, and a letter he had written in October reached Darwin at the spa. On 1 May Darwin replied, agreeing with Wallace's 1855 paper [...] "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species": [...] "I can see that we have thought much alike & to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. ... This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first-note-book, on the question how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other.— I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years." [...] He agreed with Wallace that [...] "climatal conditions" [...] had little effect, and wrote [...] "It is really impossible to explain my views in the compass of a letter on the causes & means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct & tangible idea.— Whether true or false others must judge".|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1819, Peacock was unexpectedly summoned to London {{for a period of}} probation with the East India Company who needed to reinforce their staff with talented people. They summoned to their service in the Examiner's office James Mill and three others. Peacock was included at the recommendation of Peter Auber, the company historian, whom he had known at school, though probably not as a school-fellow. Peacock's test papers earned the high commendation, [...] "Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting." [...] On 13 January 1819, he wrote from 5 York Street, Covent Garden: [...] "I now pass every morning at the India House, from half-past 10 to half-past 4, studying Indian affairs. My object is not yet attained, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> little doubt but that it will be. It was not in the first instance of my own seeking, but was proposed to me. It will lead to a very sufficing provision for me in two or three years. It is not in the common routine of office, but is an employment of a very interesting and intellectual kind, connected with finance and legislation, in which it is possible to be of great service, not only to the Company, but to the millions under their dominion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} close relatives, {{he moved in}} with his mother's family (the Kurodas). However, in January 1916, he moved into a {{boarding}} house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) {{to which he had}} formerly commuted by train. Through many of Kawabata’s works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: “I feel as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never held a woman’s hand in a romantic sense Am I a happy man deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this {{does not have to be}} taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. One of those painful love episodes was with Hatsuyo Ito ( [...] , 1906-1951) whom he met when he was 20 years old. His unsent love letter to her was recently found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. According to Kaori Kawabata, Kawabata's son-in-law, an unpublished entry in the author's diary mentions that Hatsuyo was raped by a monk at the temple she was staying at, which led her to break off their engagement.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ministers {{were all}} on hand, and ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with {{managing}} the examination. He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged. [...] What followed was a nine-hour interrogation where only four of the many errors were covered. At the end, Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. [...] He said, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." [...] With this said, it was the overwhelming conclusion of the ministers that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed any good that she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. [...] Cotton continued, [...] "You cannot Evade the Argument... that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow.... <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it."
