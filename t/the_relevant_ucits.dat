40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} analyze and clarify <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> market within air {{passenger}} transport. Further the thesis intends to investigate {{if there is any}} difference in air passenger transport in accordance to more general business. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> market is an essential step in order to establish a breach under European competition law. <b>The</b> <b>relevant</b> market includes <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> product market and <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic market. <b>The</b> fundamental issue in <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> product market is whether products are considered to be substitutable and can constitute the same market. The Commission has set a notice which includes methods and criterias and serves as guidelines to courts and companies to define <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> market. <b>The</b> notice is however not binding for courts. The CJ have developed implementation of the criterias which it tends to refer to even if it is a different branch, however a case-by-case based definition is needed. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> market is based on three main criterias: demand substitutability, supply substitutability and potential competition. Even though the supply substitutability seems not be implemented in a further extension in more general branches, it seems to be of greater importance when defining <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> market within air passenger transport. The air passenger transport has also established a test called base of origin and base of destination which includes an analysis of price, travel frequencies, comfort of the journey, transfer time to terminals and differences in the qualities and quantities in airports.   However according to air passenger transport, travel sequences seems to be the criteria that courts focus most on...|$|R

First we identify {{a number of}} explananda: their well-known in-tuitive difference in strength between ‘must’ and ‘ought’ as well as differ-ences in connections to probabilistic considerations and acts of requiring and recommending. Here we argue that important extant analyses of the se-mantic differences, though tailored to account {{for some of these}} aspects, fail to account for all. We proceed to suggest that the difference between ’ought’ and ’must’ lies in how they relate to scalar and binary standards. Briefly put, must(φ) says that among <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> alternatives, φ is selected by <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> binary standard, whereas ought(φ) says that among <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> al-ternatives, φ is selected by <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> scale.
