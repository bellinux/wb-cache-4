Four instruments (including the PVP) demonstrated strong convergent validity, and the scores in the scale were positively related to those of the other six instruments reviewed. Also, the PVP and three other instruments demonstrated a single-factor structure with the factor termed [...] "addiction". The authors concluded that [...] "on the basis of available evidence, <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggests</b> that the Problem Video Game Playing scale may provide the best overall measure of Internet Use Disorder".|$|E

25|$|A review {{commissioned}} by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, {{and that there is}} some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggest</b> that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.|$|R
40|$|Oxidation of {{cholesterol}} into oxysterols {{is a major}} way of elimination {{of cholesterol}} from the liver and extrahepatic tissues, including the brain and the retina. Oxysterols are involved in various cellular processes. Numerous links have been established between oxysterols and several disorders such as neurodegenerative pathologies, retinopathies and atherosclerosis. Different components of the lipid layer such as sphingolipids, sterols and proteins participate to membrane fluidity and forme lipid rafts microdomains. Few data {{are available on the}} links between lipids rafts and oxysterols. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>review</b> is to <b>suggest</b> the potential role of lipid rafts microdomains in the development of retinopathies with special emphasis and opening perspectives of their interactions with oxysterols.

30|$|Specific {{interventions}} for siblings {{of children with}} chronic conditions are scarce, as are studies looking into the effectiveness of such interventions. A recent systematic review included 17 studies {{on the effects of}} psychosocial {{interventions for}} siblings [25]: only one study focused on chronic conditions (cystic fibrosis and heart disease), the others focused mainly on cancer and mental illnesses. Findings in <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggest</b> that interventions aimed at improving psychological outcomes had a positive effect on siblings of children and adolescents with a chronic condition. They lead to improved knowledge about the illness, and to better externalizing and internalizing behavior scores.|$|R
40|$|<b>This</b> {{systematic}} <b>review</b> {{investigated the}} effectiveness of manual handling training at transferring knowledge, leading to a positive change in employee’s manual handling behaviour and a reduction of WRMSDs following training. Six electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials or cohort studies with a control and/or comparison group which investigated {{the effectiveness of}} manual handling training. Thirteen articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

40|$|Although {{imitation}} {{problems have}} been associated with autism for many years, the issue if these problems are a core deficit in autism remains subject of debate. In <b>this</b> <b>review</b> article, the question if autism imitation problems fulfil the criteria of uniqueness, specificity, universality, persistency, precedence and broadness is explored and discussed. Findings of <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggest</b> that there is only partial evidence for the idea that imitation problems are unique, specific and broad to autism, and that these problems are long-lasting and persistent. In addition, imitation problems seem not to be universal in autism at an early age. Mental and motor impairment may affect imitation performance but they do not seem to explain imitation problems in a sufficient way.
