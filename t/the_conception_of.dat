The thesis also describes the aspects of pedagogic interaction affecting school success of pupils. The second chapter describes the basic educative styles reflecting <b>the</b> teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil. <b>The</b> intention of the practical part of the thesis is to confirm or disprove the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objectified <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil. To reveal the relations between phenomena, the qualitative research has been used as well as the case studies from the schools, which are consistent in a pupil <b>conception.</b> <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> the work {{can be found in the}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher's <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a pupil and in the interpretation of results of the research. These results indicate, that <b>the</b> subjective <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> teachers acting according to the modern pedagogy findings is not being updated by <b>the</b> objectified school <b>conception,</b> because it was in accordance with when the teacher started an employment.

His work was then used in <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827. In 1828 C. V.

5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} the Great Wall continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years.

Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K.

5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to <b>the</b> <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
