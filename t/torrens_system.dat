50|$|The second Torrens {{jurisdiction}} {{in the world}} was established in 1861 in the then-British colony of Vancouver Island, now part of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Canada, through the federal Parliament in 1886, implemented the <b>Torrens</b> <b>system</b> in the Northwest Territories. It has continued to be used by the three Prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) into which {{the southern part of the}} Northwest Territories was divided. British Columbia uses a modified <b>Torrens</b> <b>system.</b> Since 1885, Ontario has used an English system, which is not a <b>Torrens</b> <b>system,</b> but it has similar purposes. In Ontario, electronic registration led to this version covering almost all land, but the past deeds registration still governs some issues. For properties still under deeds registration, a 40-year rule governed title, but the government converted them under a streamlined process. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia converted from a Deeds registration system to a Torrens title system in the 2000s, with the expense of the changeover charged to the purchaser. The only provinces in Canada which do not have Torrens titles include Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec, which is a civil rather than common law jurisdiction and instead uses the cadastre system.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{relationship}} Aboriginal peoples {{have with}} the land has been highlighted in recent years {{with the passing of}} the Native Title Act 1993. The vastly different characteristics of Aboriginal land tenure to the Australian <b>Torrens</b> <b>systems</b> makes it difficult for the integration of the two tenure systems into one land registration system. A better understanding of Aboriginal land tenure and associated boundary definition is a vital first step towards mapping and documenting boundaries for the purposes of resolving native title disputes and developing institutional infrastructures that can better address the duality of tenure systems. Aboriginal land tenure boundaries have been mapped in the past by various anthropologists and historians. Mapping and definition of Aboriginal land boundaries by `surveyors' are likely to provide alternative ways in which native title boundaries are determined, offering a different perspective on the spatial extent of Aboriginal land tenure.

5000|$|In many {{countries}} the <b>Torrens</b> title <b>system</b> {{of real estate}} ownership is managed and guaranteed {{by the government and}} replaces cumbersome tracing of ownership. The <b>Torrens</b> title <b>system</b> operates on the principle of [...] "title by registration" [...] (i.e. the indefeasibility of a registered interest) rather than [...] "registration of title." [...] The system does away with the need for a chain of title (i.e. tracing title through a series of documents) and does away with the conveyancing costs of such searches. The State guarantees title and is usually supported by a compensation scheme for those who lose their title due to the State's operation. It has been in practice in all Australian states and in New Zealand since between 1858 and 1875, has more recently been extended to strata title, and has been adopted by many states, provinces and countries, and in modified form in 9 states of the USA.|$|R
