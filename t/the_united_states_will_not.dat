2500|$|Robert F. Kennedy {{described}} the letter as [...] "very long and emotional." [...] Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline {{that had been}} stated to Scali earlier in the day: [...] "I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity {{of the presence of}} our military specialists in Cuba will disappear." [...] At 6:45pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a [...] "set up" [...] for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.|$|E

The documents were obtained, through Freedom of Information Act requests, and released by Eva Golinger [...] "as part of an offensive by pro-Chavez activists {{to show that the}} United States government has, at least tacitly, supported the opposition's unconstitutional efforts to remove the president". In addition to the CIA documents, The New York Times reported that Golinger also obtained [...] "reams of documents from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States government, that show that $2.2 million was spent from 2000 to 2003 to train or finance anti-Chávez parties and organizations." ...|$|E

60|$|The Japanese {{are firmly}} persuaded {{that they have}} no friends, and that the Americana are their implacable foes. One gathers that the Government regards war with America as {{unavoidable}} in the long run. The argument would be that the economic imperialism of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> tolerate the industrial development of a formidable rival in the Pacific, and that sooner or later the Japanese will be presented with the alternative of dying by starvation or on the battlefield. Then Bushido will come into play, and will lead to choice of the battlefield in preference to starvation. Admiral Sato[91] (the Japanese Bernhardi, as he is called) maintains that absence of Bushido in the Americans will lead to their defeat, and that their money-grubbing souls will be incapable of enduring the hardships and privations of a long war. This, of course, is romantic nonsense. Bushido is no use in modern war, and the Americans are quite as courageous and obstinate as the Japanese. A war might last ten years, but it would certainly end in the defeat of Japan.|$|E
