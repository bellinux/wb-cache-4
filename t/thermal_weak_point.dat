50|$|One THM350 <b>weak</b> <b>point</b> was {{excessive}} end-play {{between the}} pump and center support and resulting wobble {{of the direct}} clutch drum due to both the end play and use of a relatively narrow bushing in the drum. This <b>weak</b> <b>point</b> can be addressed by using an extra thrust washer between the planetary gear and direct clutch to remove the end play and using a wider aftermarket bushing in the direct clutch drum. Another <b>weak</b> <b>point</b> is the relatively thin center support and the lightweight matching splines in the case. This weakness can be addressed by using an inexpensive aftermarket case saver kit.|$|R

This thesis focuses on issues arising at a virtual space created for a teacher for educational purposes. The purpose of the thesis was to explore the vulnerabilities in virtual space in order to implement security patches in the future. Various hacking tools and penetration testing tools were used to discover the <b>weak</b> <b>points</b> left in the virtual space during the software development, which could be exploited by intruders.
