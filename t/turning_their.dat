5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{especially}} aggressive rams {{were sometimes}} blindfolded or hobbled. Today, those who keep rams typically prefer softer preventative measures, such as moving within a clear line to an exit, never <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> {{back on a}} ram, and possibly dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges.|$|E

5|$|The region around Brough {{continued}} to be disputed between the kings of England and Scotland; in 1173, William the Lion of Scotland invaded {{as part of the}} Great Revolt against the rule of Henry II. William's army struck south but failed to take Wark and moved on to attack Carlisle instead; when that failed too, they successfully took Appleby before <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> attention to Brough.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E

5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E

5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> rocket.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, Pixar's story {{department}} began <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> thoughts to their next film. The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn {{to the idea of}} insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation (now Walt Disney Animation Studios) had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by <b>turning</b> <b>their</b> heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E
