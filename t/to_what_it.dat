5|$|In 1998, modern Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{asks his}} {{colleague}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{for help with}} a case the Group have not authorized; he remains cryptic as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. They travel to Germany to investigate {{the murder of a}} Dr. Schlossburg, whose lab is found to house a mummified body. The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, Tennessee coach Fulmer {{pronounced}} himself unsatisfied {{with the}} Vols' performance in opponents' red zone {{during the regular}} season. Tennessee scored on just 36 of 52 possessions inside the opposition's 20-yard line, a conversion rate of 69.2 percent.

5|$|The {{region of}} Transoxiana (Arabic: Ma wara' al-nahr) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in {{the reign of}} al-Walid I (r. 705–715), {{following}} the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable, however, as demonstrated in 719, when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, beginning in 720. These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians. The Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> had been {{during the time of}} Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, control over which was lost.|$|E

25|$|In April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas {{announced}} that they proposed {{to enter into a}} codeshare agreement, arguing that it would be necessary in order to reduce empty seats and financial losses on trans-Tasman routes.

25|$|A rival Flemish newspaper, Het Volk, {{started the}} Omloop van Vlaanderen in 1945. Het Volk, a left-wing publication, wanted to {{initiate}} a new cycling event in Flanders as a rival race <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> saw as the Ronde's closeness to the Nazis. The Ronde's organizers protested that the name {{was too close to}} their own– in Dutch there is little difference between Ronde and Omloop.
