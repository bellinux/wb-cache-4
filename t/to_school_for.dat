40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{economic returns}} <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>for</b> China’s Korean {{minority in the}} urban labour market using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. The OLS estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are similar <b>to</b> findings from recent studies for the Chinese urban labour market. We use father’s education, mother’s education and spouse’s education to instrument for education. The two-stage least squares estimates are considerably higher than the OLS estimates <b>for</b> returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and slightly higher than existing two-stage least squares estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>for</b> the Chinese urban labour market. The two stage least squares estimates of the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>for</b> the Korean minority living in urban areas are high compared with the Asian average and world average. The economic returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> reported in this study assists to explain why private demand for education among the Korean minority in China is strong and provides a justification for the Korean minority’s focus on educational attainment. ...|$|R

North Carolina had seven players taken in the draft, three of whom were selected in the first round: Greg Ellis was taken with the eighth pick, Brian Simmons with the 17th pick, and Vonnie Holliday with the 19th pick.

5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family.

After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple.

One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt.

At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>for</b> a short period of time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E

40|$|The author uses micro {{data from}} the Labor Force Surveys {{conducted}} in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during 1981 - 91 to show that during 1981 - 87 wage differences between schooling groups fell by well over one-half.

Since the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>for</b> Israeli Jews were stable, the decline in returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>for</b> Palestinians is consistent with the notion that the returns <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in the territories were determined largely by the forces of supply and demand in a segmented market for skilled labor.

25|$|In {{order for}} women’s {{education}} {{to be as}} equal as the men’s in Ivory Coast, the government must provide more schools for free, so that the people don’t think about financial issues once they put their child at school, and so the parents can afford to put both {{their sons and daughters}} in school.
