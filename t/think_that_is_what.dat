The end of the song segued into the beginning of [...] "Zoo Station", leading concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra to speculate that it was being considered to open the set. In 2006, The Edge said [...] "it never became a live favourite... I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> people come to U2 for." [...] In 2012, Willie Williams, U2's lighting designer and concert director, described the rehearsed version as [...] "extremely dramatic", saying [...] "in a stadium situation {{it could be argued}} that it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience to fuck off." ...|$|E
500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of}} the wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E

She explained, [...] "It {{was something very}} raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.'
