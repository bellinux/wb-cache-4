40|$|The two {{closely related}} {{eukaryotic}} AAA+ proteins, <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49, are essential components of large multi-protein complexes {{that are involved}} in diverse cellular processes. Specific mechanisms for their activity in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling, DNA repair and apoptosis have not yet been characterised; however, different oligomeric forms, sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 may be important in co-ordinating these functions. The assembly of the human <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 into different oligomers was studied. Both proteins were mainly monomeric in the absence of nucleotide cofactors. Incubation with ATP or ADP in the presence of Mg 2 + modified the distribution of <b>TIP</b> 48 oligomers to favour hexamers, but this did not occur with <b>TIP</b> 49. The double hexameric complex of <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 was also analysed and indicated a heterodisperse population of species, which provided clues about assembly pathways. <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 are structurally homologous to the bacterial branch migration motor RuvB. <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 do not incorporate the DNA binding domain present in RuvB, and instead have acquired a novel domain (Domain II) inserted between the Walker A and B ATPase motifs. Using mutants, we demonstrated that <b>TIP</b> 48 Domain II is critical for regulating nucleotide dependent hexamerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48. Furthermore, <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complexes lacking Domain II indicated that hexamer-hexamer interactions are not exclusively mediated by Domain II; this domain may regulate the assembly of different forms of the heteromeric complex. Interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 and several putative binding partners were tested in vitro. The ATPase activity and oligomerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 were assayed in the presence of Hint 1, which was reported to disrupt the homotypic and heterotypic interactions within the <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complex. Finally, the sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 were analysed. Using immunofluorescence and GFP-tagged <b>TIP</b> 49, we confirmed that <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 associate with the mitotic spindle; however, <b>TIP</b> 48 accumulates at the midbody during cytokinesis, while <b>TIP</b> 49 does not. Furthermore, we investigated potential modifications of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 by 2 -D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which may account for the regulation of these distinct functions. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tat-interactive protein 60 (<b>Tip</b> 60) is {{a member}} of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases. Studies using cultured cells have shown that <b>Tip</b> 60 has various {{functions}} including DNA repair, apoptosis and cell-cycle regulation. We globally ablated the <b>Tip</b> 60 gene (Htatip), observing that <b>Tip</b> 60 -null embryos die at the blastocyst stage (Hu et al. Dev. Dyn. 238 : 2912; 2009). Although adult heterozygous (<b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-)) mice reproduce normally without a haploinsufficient phenotype, stress caused by Myc over-expression induced B-cell lymphoma in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) adults, suggesting that <b>Tip</b> 60 is a tumor suppressor (Gorrini et al. Nature 448 : 1063; 2007). These findings prompted assessment of whether <b>Tip</b> 60, alternative splicing of which generates two predominant isoforms termed <b>Tip</b> 60 α and <b>Tip</b> 60 β, functions to suppress the cell-cycle in adult cardiomyocytes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Western blotting revealed that <b>Tip</b> 60 α is the predominant <b>Tip</b> 60 isoprotein in the embryonic heart, transitioning at neonatal stages to <b>Tip</b> 60 β, which is the only isoprotein in the adult heart wherein it is highly enriched. Over-expression of <b>Tip</b> 60 β, but not <b>Tip</b> 60 α, inhibited cell proliferation in NIH 3 T 3 cells; and, <b>Tip</b> 60 -haploinsufficient cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes exhibited increased cell-cycle activity. To address whether <b>Tip</b> 60 β suppresses the cardiomyocyte cell-cycle in the adult heart, hypertrophic stress was induced in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/+) and Tip(+/-) littermates via two methods, Myc over-expression and aortic banding. Based on immunostaining cell-cycle markers and western blotting cyclin D, stress increased cardiomyocyte cell-cycle mobilization in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) hearts, in comparison with <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/+) littermates. Aortic-banded <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) hearts also exhibited significantly decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide evidence that <b>Tip</b> 60 may function in a tumor suppressor pathway(s) to maintain adult cardiomyocytes in replicative senescence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A thick <b>tip</b> foil blade was {{designed}} to reduce the <b>tip</b> leakage flow and weaken the <b>tip</b> vortexes in ducted propeller 19 A/Ka 4 - 55. The thick <b>tip</b> foil was constructed by normal extrusion of the original <b>tip</b> foil. The maximum thickness of the foil increased from 1. 64 % chord length to 7. 64 %. The commercial CFD code CFX was employed to simulate the flow field of the two ducted propellers. From the performance curves, it could be concluded that the <b>tip</b> foil thickening will not affect the thrust and torque of the ducted propeller much. The <b>tip</b> leakage vortex (TLV) in the thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller was obviously weaker than that in the original propeller. The pressure drop in TLV middle chord position decreased by 32. 8 %. In the <b>tip</b> clearance, both propellers have the <b>tip</b> clearance vortex.
