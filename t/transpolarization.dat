40|$|A transpolarizing {{reflector}} is proposed. It {{consists of}} periodic patches above a ground plane, with wide diagonal slots. For normal incidence, linear polarization along a principal direction {{is transformed into}} the orthogonal polarization with a 20 -dB ratio over a 29. 7 % bandwidth. We prove that, {{in view of the}} diagonal symmetry of the structure, reflected fields in the principal directions must be in quadrature. The <b>transpolarization</b> bandwidth slowly decreases for incidence away from broadside. This surface very efficiently produces polarization conversion for circularly polarized incident fields. The quality of this conversion, described in terms of axial ratio, is obtained front the <b>transpolarization</b> level achieved in the linear polarization case.
