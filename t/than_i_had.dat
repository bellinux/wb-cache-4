5|$|What {{were the}} {{possibilities}} which thus presented themselves? Firstly, in that {{of making a}} film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language. Secondly, that of using this English language... in a more varied and, to me, more interesting way <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen on film before.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of this enquiry I found that much more had been done <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been aware of, when I first {{published}} the Essay. The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|Bellomont's rule in New York was not remembered fondly. One {{political}} opponent, {{noting that}} the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure, wrote that the memory of Bellomont [...] "will stink in the nostrills of all good men", and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was [...] "a greater Debt <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever seen". Bellomont's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up: his creditors tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his wife's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts. Bellomont's financial issues were not unique in this respect. Later governors (including Nanfan and Cornbury) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness {{at the behest of}} their political opponents. New York's debt problems were not resolved until the Hunter administration in 1717.|$|E

500|$|Examining {{the acting}} in a review {{published}} in Starlog magazine, Alan Jones expressed a preference for the British members of the cast, crediting Geeson as [...] "absolutely first-rate" [...] and criticising [...] "the weak performances from the token Americans, Robin Clarke and Jennifer Ashley". Praising the production values for cost-effectiveness, he discerned signs of Warren's [...] "particular trademark" [...] in such murder scenes as that of Barbra (through repeated scissor-stabbing) and Holly (through heat-searing). He professed his opinion that Inseminoid [...] "is not faultless by any means", citing a predictable and often [...] "ridiculous" [...] plot as factors detracting from his pleasure in viewing the film. Nevertheless, he asserted that Inseminoid meets audience demands for a B film of its genre, progressing [...] "at such a pace that you nearly almost forget that you've seen it all before", and declared it to be [...] "far less routine and far more enjoyable <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Groves {{became the}} {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September, with the rank of brigadier general. That afternoon, he took a train to Knoxville, where he met with Marshall. After touring the site, Groves concluded that the site [...] "was an even better choice <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> anticipated". He called Colonel John J. O'Brien of the Corps of Engineers' Real Estate Branch, and told him to proceed with acquiring the land. The site was initially known as the Kingston Demolition Range; it officially became the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) in January 1943, and was given the codename Site X. After the township was established in mid-1943, the name Oak Ridge was chosen from employee suggestions. It met with the Manhattan District's approval because [...] "its rural connotation held outside curiosity to a minimum". Oak Ridge then became the site's postal address, but the site itself was not officially renamed Oak Ridge until 1947.|$|E
500|$|Christian Scientists {{call this}} [...] "the fall in Lynn," [...] {{and see it}} as the birth of their religion. Decades later Eddy wrote that, on the third day after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not said anything to him about a miraculous healing.|$|E

500|$|Poe {{claimed he}} wrote [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{before he was}} 15 years old, though he would later adapt his claim. A few {{passages}} from the poem were first published in the May 19, 1829, issue of the Baltimore Gazette signed [...] "Marlow". Poe first offered the complete poem to publishers Carey, Lea & Carey in Philadelphia around May 1829. He wrote to them, [...] "If the poem is published, succeed or not, I am 'irrecoverably a poet.' But to your opinion I leave it". He met with Isaac Lea, {{who was willing to}} publish it so long as they were protected against any loss. Poe asked his foster-father John Allan to subsidize the printing but, not supportive of Poe's literary pursuits, he refused. By July 28, Poe wrote to the publishers asking for the return of his manuscript because, as he said, he had [...] "made a better disposition of my poems <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any right to expect".|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} with his family, Speer came to Coesfeld to visit Wolters in October 1966. [...] Shortly before Speer's visit, Annemarie Kempf had visited Wolters in Coesfeld {{to ask him}} not to allow his differences with Speer to affect their first meeting. Wolters responded that he and Speer were [...] "too far apart". [...] The visit was quickly marred by Speer's insistence on inviting industrialist [...] to Wolters' home instead of allowing a one-on-one reunion. [...] According to Wolters' son Fritz, his father was furious and hurt by the perceived slight. [...] While the actual meeting was casual and cordial (in addition to the long-promised ham and wine, Wolters turned over all of the accumulated papers from Speer, the censored copy of the Chronik and the remaining balance of DM25,000 in the School Fund Account), Wolters later wrote, [...] "I knew that day of that first still merry reunion that the Spandau friendship was over. [...] As he stood there, in person, I saw him suddenly quite differently <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> previously." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "there is no {{question}} that [...] is a fan service." [...] He called it a [...] "mixed bag"; on one hand, he noted that some of the scenes were clever, such as Darryl's opinion on portraying a black president before Obama was elected. On the other hand, however, he felt that Michael's [...] "juvenile" [...] response to Holly was uncharacteristic, and the [...] "oddly high production values and camera work" [...] were unrealistic for the show. He also felt the inclusion of some characters—such as Roy, Jan, or Karen—did not make sense {{in the context of the}} series. He concluded, however, that while the episode had issues, [...] "the actual content of Threat Level Midnight was successful in more ways <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected". Rick Porter of Zap2it gave the episode a more mixed review, saying that it [...] "had moments that were a huge amount of fun, both inside Michael's labor of love and in people's reaction to it. But it also felt a little bit clip-showy." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied {{with each}} other to conduct the first orchestral {{gramophone}} recording of The Rite. While Stravinsky led L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski's version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960. According to the critic Edward Greenfield, Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra the composer inspired a performance with [...] "extraordinary thrust and resilience". In conversations with Robert Craft, Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of The Rite made in the 1960s. He thought Herbert von Karajan's 1963 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, was good, but [...] "the performance is... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one". Stravinsky thought that Pierre Boulez, with the Orchestre National de France (1963), was [...] "less good <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations". He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra [...] for making the music sound Russian, [...] "which is just right", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction of}} the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac {{that could have been}} a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them {{for the rest of the}} year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned [...] "rather sooner <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." [...] He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, [...] "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as quiet as a sucking dove." [...] Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E
