5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue {{an unconscious}} American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American passport, Jason Bourne.|$|E

25|$|When Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of the nation's passenger service on May 1, 1971, the 35-year run of the Super Chief on the Santa Fe ended, though Amtrak used <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same route for three years. In 1974 the Santa Fe withdrew {{permission to use the}} name due to a perceived decline in service, so Amtrak renamed it Southwest Limited. Following the delivery of new Superliner equipment, the Santa Fe allowed Amtrak to call it the Southwest Chief in 1984.|$|E

25|$|Forming a deep friendship, Livgren and Montre {{decided to}} leave the Mellotones and join the more commercially viable band The Reasons Why, which {{included}} Lynn Meredith and Wright. Though this band was doing well financially, Livgren became frustrated because of his desire for more creative expression, and he and Montre decided to start their own band. They briefly reformed the Gimlets with former members Scott Kessler and Wright along with several new members. A short time later, they renamed the band Saratoga after <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pencil that Livgren was using to write songs. Saratoga included Meredith, Montre, Wright, Livgren, Phil Ehart and Dave Hope.|$|E
25|$|The count {{that took}} place on {{election}} night gave Flood a one-vote lead. On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead. Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found that one was for Flood, resulting in a tie. The other absentee ballot was not opened as <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> envelope did not match any names on the voter-registration list. Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted. For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts. On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie. To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.|$|E

25|$|The bar {{is packed}} with students, artists and flower girls, singing and dancing. Magda enters and attracts the {{attention}} of several young men. She hurries over to a table at which Ruggero is sitting alone. She apologizes for intruding and tells him that she will move away {{as soon as the}} young men at the bar stop watching her. Ruggero, who does not recognize Magda in her disguise, asks her to stay. They chat and Ruggero tells Magda that she reminds him of the quiet and elegant girls from his home town, Montauban. They dance happily together. Prunier and Lisette enter, arguing about Prunier's desire to turn Lisette into a lady and to educate her. Magda and Ruggero return to their table and Magda begins to reminisce about a past love affair. Ruggero asks for her name and she answers 'Pauletta'. She writes <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tablecloth and Ruggero adds his own beneath. The attraction between Magda and Ruggero grows as they talk. Lisette and Prunier pass their table and Lisette recognizes Magda. Magda signals to Prunier not to give away her secret and Prunier tells Lisette she is mistaken. To prove his point, he introduces Lisette to Magda, who tries to maintain her disguise, to the puzzlement of Lisette. The two couples sit together and drink a toast to love. Prunier notices that Rambaldo has come in, and orders Lisette to take Ruggero out of the room for a few minutes, which she does. Rambaldo demands an explanation from Magda for her behaviour and disguise; she tells him that she has nothing to add to what he has already seen. Rambaldo suggests they leave together but she refuses and declares her love for Ruggero, apologizing for any pain she is causing Rambaldo by her actions. Rambaldo tells her that he cannot prevent her staying with Ruggero. As he leaves, Ruggero returns, and tells Magda that dawn is breaking. They decide to begin a new life together, but Magda secretly worries that she is deceiving Ruggero.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} and authorized Final Fantasy VII game {{was developed by}} Square and released worldwide in 1997 for the PlayStation. At an unknown date, ShenZhen Nanjing Technology developed an unauthorized remake of the game, for the Famicom. The game was released in 2005, and both the box and manual make reference to Final Fantasy VII Advent Children as the game's full title, a statement supported by the game's manual. Despite <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box and cartridge, the title screen simply states [...] "Final Fantasy VII," [...] and the game itself includes no content or plot elements from the film. The game was developed for the SUBOR entertainment system, a clone of the Famicom, though {{it can also be}} played on Famicom and NES consoles through the use of an adapter.|$|E
500|$|The portion from Boulevard to {{near the}} Imperial County line was {{included}} in the California Highway Commission budget for 1965–1966. A [...] extension from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J-35 was given $3.3million (about $ in [...] dollars) in funding by the Highway Commission in May 1965. The [...] section in between this one and the Mountain Springs pass section was in planning by that September, and was scheduled to begin the building phase shortly thereafter, with the section extending west of Boulevard to follow. That section, from Crestwood to Boulevard, was to begin construction soon after the $3million (about $ in [...] dollars) contract was given out in January 1966. The coming of the freeway from both west and east of Jacumba was projected to be a significant event {{in the history of the}} town. Cafes and gas stations went out of business once the freeway bypassed the town; however, many retirees relocated into the town since the high traffic levels were gone. The labeling of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I-8 signs raised controversy and forced the Division of Highways to obscure <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> signs until the issue was resolved.|$|E

500|$|For {{several decades}} after Lewis and Clark sighted the mountain, people {{continued}} to get Adams confused with St. Helens, {{due in part}} to their somewhat similar appearance and similar latitude. In the 1830s, Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. Mount Hood, in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President John Adams and St. Helens was to be renamed after George Washington. In a mistake or deliberate change by mapmaker and proponent of the Kelley plan, Thomas J. Farnham, the names for Hood and St. Helens were interchanged. And, likely because of the confusion about which mountain was St. Helens, he placed the Mount Adams name north of Mount Hood and about [...] east of Mount St. Helens. By what would seem sheer coincidence, there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed. However, it was not official until 1853, when the Pacific Railroad Surveys, under the direction of Washington Territory governor Isaac I. Stevens, determined its location, described the surrounding countryside, and placed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> map.|$|E
500|$|Noble and Metcalfe {{left the}} Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose {{introduced}} the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at {{a studio in}} West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was {{taking a break from}} his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that [...] "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.|$|E
