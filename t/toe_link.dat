50|$|The 2013 Chrysler 200 Convertible {{featured}} revised suspensions. Prior to the 2013 model year, {{the suspension}} on convertibles was largely {{shared with the}} Sebring that preceded it. The softtop convertible now matches the sedan's revised suspension. The hardtop meanwhile could not fully accommodate the changes, due to the stiffer suspension possibly harming the hardtop components in extreme situations. The hardtop still received the updated steering rack and rear <b>toe</b> <b>link</b> that the softtop received.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the FEM {{analysis}} of the distributions and varieties of the stresses and the strains of the large-size dissimilar steel welded tube-plate structure under cyclic loading, the fatigue crack initiation sites of this structure were predicted. The low-cycle fatigue test was performed to verify the prediction and to study the cracks propagating paths as well. The {{results indicated that the}} weld <b>toes</b> <b>linked</b> to the two surfaces of the plate were the positions with the peak values of the maximum stress and the stress amplitude. The plastic deformations in the first loading cycle introduced the tensile-compressive repeated stress cycle at the weld toes during the subsequent loading cycles. It induced the fatigue cracks initiating at the weld <b>toes</b> <b>linked</b> to the two surfaces of the plate respectively. After initiating from the surfaces the cracks propagated along the fusion lines with a short distance then turn into the base metal in the sections vertical to the surfaces. The depth of the crack initiating from the compressed surface was shorter than the one from the tensioned surface. 1...|$|R
50|$|The VT series heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} (IRS) as standard across the range. However, when originally carried over, the European design was simplified with {{the removal of the}} <b>toe</b> control <b>link,</b> standard equipment on the six-cylinder Omega since 1987. This design was prone to distorting the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy loads (e.g. when towing or travelling over undulated surfaces), leading to excessive rear tyre wear. Holden's performance arm HSV re-added the <b>toe</b> control <b>link</b> on the flagship GTS 300 model, based on the Series II update.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{model of}} a walking pattern imitating human motion is presented. An {{accurate}} imitation of human motion and a robust bipedal walking motion are, however, hardly realized together. We therefore focus on only three charac-teristics of human walking motion: single toe support, knee stretching, and swing leg motion. Based on a conventional pattern generator, single toe support is added, waist height is changed in order to stretch the knees as much as possible, and swing leg motion is generated approximating the human’s motion. The generated motion is then filtered to provide a feasible pattern. In addition, the stabilizer is improved {{in order to keep}} the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) within the tiny support polygon during the single support phase with <b>toe</b> <b>link.</b> Finally, we successfully demonstrate the generated walking pattern with the robot HRP- 4 C.

5000|$|The {{speed at}} which weight {{transfer}} occurs {{as well as through}} which components it transfers is complex and is determined by many factors including but not limited to roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness and the kinematic design of the suspension links. In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements such as springs, dampers and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be [...] "elastic", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links such as A-arms and <b>toe</b> <b>links</b> is said to be [...] "geometric".|$|R

500|$|The VX series also {{formed the}} basis for a new Holden Ute, {{designated}} the VU-series. Earlier utility models were instead entitled [...] "Commodore utility". An updated Series II was launched in early 2002, featuring revised rear suspension system now equipped with <b>toe</b> control <b>links</b> to address the VT's issues. The VX series also spawned the production version of the re-launched Holden Monaro (allowing Holden to commence exports to the United States, with this coupé sold as the Pontiac GTO).|$|R
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the <b>toe</b> control <b>links</b> that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|R
500|$|Notably, Holden's {{performance}} arm HSV re-added the <b>toe</b> control <b>link</b> on {{the flagship}} GTS 300 model. The 1999 Series II update replaced the venerable Holden 5.0-litre V8 engine {{with a new}} 5.7-litre Generation III V8 sourced from the United States. The V8 was detuned to [...] from the original US version, but would receive incremental power upgrades to [...] throughout its time in the Commodore, before finally being replaced by the related Generation 4 in the VZ. The supercharged V6 was uprated to 171kilowatts (229hp) from the VS. Safety wise, side airbags became an option for the Acclaim and higher models, a first for Holden.|$|R
500|$|In 1874, English {{zoologist}} Alfred Henry Garrod {{published a}} study {{where he had}} examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five [...] they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical Pelecaniformes), he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics {{more in common with}} Procellariiformes than Pelecaniformes, though concluded they still belonged in the latter group (as suborder Fregatae), albeit as an early offshoot. Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional Pelecaniformes, calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets, darters and cormorants, and tropicbirds the most distant lineage. The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes, united by feet that are totipalmate (with all four <b>toes</b> <b>linked</b> by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The DNA–DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins, loons, petrels and albatrosses. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.|$|R
50|$|Toe wrestling {{is similar}} to arm wrestling. To play, players must take off their shoes and socks as {{the game is played}} with bare feet. It is common {{courtesy}} for each player to remove the other player's shoes and socks. Players must <b>link</b> <b>toes</b> and each player's foot must touch flat on the other person's foot. The opponents proceed to attempt to pin (capture or trap) the other's foot for three seconds while avoiding the same. There are 3 rounds played on a best 2 out of 3 basis. First with the right foot, then left, and right again if necessary.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bigger and}} heavier second {{generation}} CR-V (Chassis Code RD4-RD8) {{was a full}} redesign, based on the seventh generation Civic, and powered by the K24A1 engine.

Second generation CR-Vs in countries outside of North America were again offered in both [...] "low specification" [...] and [...] "high specification" [...] variants, with the latter featuring body-colored bumpers and fittings. It also now did not require the glass hatch to be opened before the swinging door. Changes between model years 2002, 2003, and 2004 were minor, involving an enlargement of the center compartment bin and the addition of a front passenger door power lock in the latter two years respectively. The success of the CR-V prompted Honda to introduce an entry-level SUV, the Element.|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To {{compare the}} value of ankle and toe {{pressures}} as regards the diagnosis of critical ischaemia, its prognosis, {{and the need for}} vascular surgery. Design:University hospital-based retrospective study. Materials and methods:Fifty-seven patients (23 women and 34 men) with gangrene or rest pain had a haemodynamic evaluation combining ankle systolic pressure, toe pressure and cutaneous oximetry (tcPO 2) with long-term follow-up (until death, for 44 %). Results:After 2 years of follow-up, actuarial rates were 49 and 79 % for survival and limb salvage, respectively. Ankle and toe pressures gave rise to different subsets of patients, p< 0. 001, mainly because of the existence of a group of patients with very distal foot arterial disease. Low ankle pressure was linked to the risk of major amputation. Low <b>toe</b> pressure was <b>linked</b> to a great need for vascular surgery. Diabetes increased the risk of minor amputation. Conclusions:The concept of critical ischaemia remains clinically relevant. Haemodynamic quantitative data strengthen this concept, but ankle and toe pressures are not interchangeable parameters. For these reasons, toe pressures should be changed from a recommended to a mandatory haemodynamic parameter in the definition of critical ischaemia...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Durance River is a gravel-bed river deeply {{impacted}} in its downstream part by gravel {{mining and}} flow diversion. The {{modification of the}} flow regime and the gravel extractions {{have led to a}} significant reduction of the bankfull channel width (from 50 to 80 % for the 1960 - 2000 period), a river bed degradation and, above all, a vegetation encroachment associated to an important overbank sedimentation. These changes result in a modification of flowing conditions during floods and an increase in flood risk because the lateral mobility is not high enough to rework regularly the vegetated landforms. Therefore lateral mobility processes and rate have to be better understood and quantified. We work on three different spatial scales (bar, bend and reach scales) in order to characterize and quantify the lateral mobility. First of all, at fine scale, we use PIT Tags and an event topographic survey to study the entrainment threshold variability of the particles of the bar and the bank <b>toe.</b> Then the <b>link</b> between discharge, lateral bank mobility and vertical channel mobility is investigated at bend scale thanks to event topographic survey and physical characterization of the bed material (size and shape). Finally, the lateral mobility quantification at reach scale requires both a diachronic study on orthophoto and an in situ topographic survey. The first results highlight not only a coupled mobility between bank and channel but also a high spatial variability of lateral mobility linked to both local hydrodynamic conditions and geographical position of sediment sources...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers, {{each of which}} complements the regional understanding of the Ceduna Delta System, offshore South Australia. Deltas commonly form linked systems of extension, on the delta top, and compression, in the delta <b>toe.</b> This <b>link</b> is promoted {{by the presence of}} a detachment layer of more ductile sediments {{at the base of the}} delta, which mechanically decouples deltaic sediments from those beneath it. These systems are often explained using Critical Taper Wedge mechanics, which is commonly applied to understand the rock strength properties and the role of pore fluid pressure at the base of the wedge (within the detachment layer) and within the wedge, in these linked systems of extension and compression. To better understand the effect of basal pore fluid pressure on delta—deepwater fold thrust belt systems, I present an in-depth application of Critical Taper Wedge mechanics to the data-rich deepwater Niger Delta Toe in West Africa, a modern day analogue for the ancient Ceduna Sub-basin (Paper 1). This application involved developing a new technique to measure key variables from seismic reflection data in the Niger Delta Toe and input them into a script to calculate the basal pore fluid pressure required to form the observed present-day geometries. With this new approach and increased understanding of the role of basal pore fluid pressure on delta wedge geometry it was possible to better understand how detachment variables control distribution of the lobes that comprise the Cretaceous-age Ceduna Delta. Regional structural mapping of the Ceduna Delta resulted in separation of the delta lobes based on tectonic style and also examining the linkages between the systems, explaining the unique stacking of the delta tops while each system maintained independent deepwater fold-thrust belts (Paper 2). Furthermore, detailed 3 D seismic reflection data is interpreted to investigate inversion structures and potential for fault reactivation in the basin (Paper 3). The boundary element method geomechanical code Poly 3 D© was used to investigate delta-top fault reactivation potential from a 3 D seismic derived fault network along with the present day stress determined from petroleum wells. Results demonstrate a moderate to high probability for contemporary reactivation of faults under a strike-slip to strike-slip-normal fault stress regime (Paper 3). In addition, detrital zircon analysis, apatite fission track analysis and zircon fission track analysis were undertaken to investigate the potential source(s) for the deltaic sediment input in the Ceduna Delta system (Paper 4). Over 1500 detrital zircon and apatite grains were analysed from petroleum wells and outcrop samples located onshore and offshore South Australia. The results indicate approximately 1 - 2 km of Late Cretaceous uplift/exhumation of the proximal arcuate shaped South Australian southern margin provided the source for the Santonian-Maastrichtian delta lobe, mainly from erosion of existing Permian-Cenomanian sedimentary cover. Finally, the last paper presented in this thesis (Paper 5) ties in new 2 D reflection seismic data that was not available when Paper 2 was written, to further examine the geometry of the deepwater fold-thrust belts and the hydrocarbon potential of the Ceduna Sub-basin.
