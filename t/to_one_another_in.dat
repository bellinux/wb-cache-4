5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> <b>In</b> 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.|$|E
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E

5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated {{to be as much}} as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E

25|$|Card {{counting}} is {{most rewarding}} {{near the end}} of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.|$|E

25|$|Discounting to face value: Before {{national}} currencies {{and efficient}} clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable {{at face value}} at the issuing bank. Even a branch bank could discount notes of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the issuing bank. The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but sometimes became worthless. The problem of discounting within a country does not exist with national currencies; however, under floating exchange rates currencies are valued relative <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the foreign exchange market.|$|E

25|$|In 1767 Charles Burney eloped {{to marry}} {{for a second}} time, to Elizabeth Allen, the wealthy widow of a King's Lynn wine merchant. Allen had three {{children}} of her own, and several years after the marriage the two families merged into one. This new domestic situation was unfortunately fraught with tension. The Burney children found their new stepmother overbearing and quick to anger, and they took refuge from the situation by making fun of the woman behind her back. However, their collective unhappiness served in some respects to bring them closer <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> <b>In</b> 1774 the family moved again to {{what had been the}} house of Isaac Newton in St Martin's Street, Westminster, London.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} these inaugural qualification sessions, which were held on 27 and 28 May 1911, anecdotes would occasionally arise, and thereafter be steadily embellished in their retelling, regarding the purported qualifying times and speeds of given competitors, and how they compared <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> <b>In</b> reality, no records of the sessions were kept at all, let alone publicized, with the sole objective being the confirmation of each car's capability to achieve the minimum speed. Also in contrast to later eras, both the starting order and the car numbering {{of the participants were}} determined not by respective speeds or previous seasonal point totals, but by entry date, with the Strang-driven Case entry being assigned #1 in the first starting position.|$|E
25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must {{have been made in}} proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|E

According to scholar William Kaplowitz, within six years there were over twenty other similar synagogues around the world, including: Shira Hadasha in Melbourne, Australia, Darchei Noam in Modi’in, and others in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, New Haven, Cambridge, Washington, D.C., and several more, (including a cluster in the Tri-State area alone). By 2014, an additional dozen or so were created in communities such as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mazkeret Batya and Beersheba in Israel, two in the United Kingdom, several on college campuses, and more.|$|E
