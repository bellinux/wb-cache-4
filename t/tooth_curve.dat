40|$|Methods for {{accurate}} grinding of face-hobbed bevel gears {{have not been}} developed to date, the main obstacles being their epicycloidal lengthwise <b>tooth</b> <b>curve</b> and slot width taper. Grinding them while preserving their geometry would be desirable, as the epicycloidal <b>tooth</b> <b>curve</b> makes face-hobbed gears less sensitive to misalignments and deflections. To this end, we propose a method based on a flared-cup grinding wheel, whereby generated members are ground by a two-parameter enveloping process, while non-generated ones are finished by a one-parameter enveloping motion. Machine motions are synthesized exploiting the capabilities of 6 -axis hypoid generators. Interference between parts is avoided...|$|E

The construction stages are calculation, development of blanks, development of tooth rims and involute gears. The involute meshing is formed in the normal as related to a <b>tooth</b> <b>curve</b> plane using equivalent wheels and making involutes according to parametric equations. The closed region of a tooth contour is pressed out along the trajectory, a helix with an angle of lead equal to the helix angle is used in such capacity. Then the tooth is distributed following the Circular Sketch Pattern along a blank, forming a rim of the wheel. The gear assembly is carried out {{with the help of}} a layout sketch. The teeth are matched with gashes by using a pitch point and cutting the teeth by a plane which is perpendicular to a transmission axis. The accuracy of a gear model is analyzed by clearance measuring, interference, parameters of rims, and sizing of contact patterns.

The most used materials for gear box production are structural steel, heat-treatable steel and cementation steel. The effect of material quality and its properties on gears will be presented through calculation of gear load capacity, in cases when gears are made of cementation steel and heat-treateble steel. Besides requirements related to material quality there are also requirements posed for gears teeth quality.
