5|$|Ptolemy {{decided to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to {{surprise}} Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother’s sixty ships {{so they could}} then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy's arrival, took steps just {{in order to prevent}} this from happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and interposing himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that {{he would be able to}} defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish commanders {{had decided}} they must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> stand. A few {{kilometers}} west of Nyborg the Swedish forces of about 5,500 men stood in battle {{formation in the}} way of the advancing forces. The Swedes had a good position, with a small lake on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bid for the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E

They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks.

Pennsylvania {{was in the}} midst of an oil boom in the late 19th century after oil had been {{discovered}} near Titusville, 280 miles to the west. The North Penn Oil and Gas Company sunk a test well in 1902. They quickly failed, plugged the well and left the area. Methane gas escaped from the well and was used by the Wheaton family, owners of a nearby dairy farm. They used this gas, released by the oil prospectors, for many years to provide lighting for their home and gas for their stove.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature.

25|$|Day three {{began with}} the weather again threatening, and Chappell {{declared}} the Australian innings closed without returning to the crease to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> game of it. However Glamorgan openers Jones and Hopkins made much better work of it the second time around, pushing the score past 100 without loss. With Australia's frontline bowlers struggling to make a breakthrough, spinner Ray Bright was brought on, and made an immediate impact, having the advancing Hopkins stumped brilliantly by replacement wicket-keeper Richie Robinson for 66. Bright troubled the Glamorgan batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and soon claimed another, Arthur Francis for 2, leaving Glamorgan on 119–2. Gwyn Richards arrived as his replacement and tried to lift the scoring, but Bright soon claimed Jones for 47, and Mike Llewellyn for 9. Glamorgan had reached 164 for 4 off 43 overs and decided to end their innings and give the Australian's a competitive target. Bright finished with 4 for 53.|$|E

500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template.

You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style {{is determined by the}} subject, by the mood of the times.

500|$|This episode saw The Simpsons surpass The Flintstones for {{the number}} of episodes {{produced}} for an animated series. The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> show [...] "fresh" [...] again. The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as [...] "jumping the shark", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children, who have grown up. This was the case in [...] "Oliver" [...] in The Brady Bunch or [...] "Luke" [...] on Growing Pains. Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this, by attempting to keep The Itchy and Scratchy Show and the Simpson family fresh respectively.|$|E

The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I {{wanted it to be}} a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other...

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Warner Bros. planned {{to produce a}} feature biographical film about actor James Dean, and the studio hired Israel Horovitz to write the script. One of the working titles was James Dean: An Invented Life before it was {{finalized}} as James Dean. When Horovitz wrote the script, he explored the [...] "psychological insight" [...] of Dean by showcasing the abandonment of his father, which became the fulcrum of the storyline. Horovitz recalled, [...] "Why would a father ship his wife's body back on a train with an 8-year-old son, never go to the funeral and never pick the son up again, never bring the son back out to him?" [...] The screenwriter felt {{it was best to}} portray Dean's purported homosexuality by innuendo rather than explicitly. He wanted to focus on the romance between Dean and Pier Angeli and Dean's growth as an actor, and believed that a homosexuality subplot would distract from the storyline. Producer Marvin Worth explained in July 1995, [...] "We'll <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good movie... not one of rumor and innuendo." ...|$|E
