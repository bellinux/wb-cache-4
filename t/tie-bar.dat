The conclusion of the enquiry was that the speed of the train had been excessive, especially considering its motley collection of carriages. However, an extra <b>tie-bar</b> was added to points so as to increase their strength and stability, a design modification which remains in current points on the national network.|$|E

50|$|The {{main street}} is {{occupied}} by several grade II listed buildings, {{dating back to the}} eighteenth century. The oldest is the Old Manor, originally an L-shaped building dating from {{the early part of the}} century, but the rear wing was demolished in the 1950s. It is constructed of brick, some of which is rendered, with a pantile roof. Elmtree House if a pebbledashed brick structure, with a slate roof, dating from the middle of the century. Reedness Manor House is also brick with a slate roof, but the front was replaced in the nineteenth century, and is pebbledashed, while Reedness Hall is built in plain brick, with a slate roof at the front and pantiles at the back. Both data from mid-century. The Ferry House (was Ferry Inn/Angel Inn) on the junction with Church Lane, is the only one which carries a date. <b>Tie-bar</b> ends on the gables indicate that it was built in 1778, although there have been later additions to the red-brick, pantile-roofed building.|$|E

40|$|Normal and {{deformed}} forefeet {{have been}} investigated by cadaver anatomical dissections and experiments, by radiographs, CT and MRI scanning, and by clinical studies. Evidence is presented {{to show that the}} skeleton of the foot rests on and is controlled by a multi-segmental ligamentous and fascial <b>tie-bar</b> system. Transversely across the plantar aspect of the forefoot, the plantar plates and the deep transverse metatarsal ligaments form a strong ligamentous structure which prevents undue splaying of the forefoot. Longitudinally, the five digital processes of the deeper layer of the plantar fascia are inserted into the plantar plates and control the longitudinal arch of the foot. It is suggested that many forefoot deformities result from the failure of parts of the <b>tie-bar</b> system and the dynamic effect of displacement of the plantar plates. Understanding this allows a more logical approach to their treatment...|$|E
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} baulks, {{and therefore}} the rails, were kept to gauge by 'transoms' - transverse timber spacers - and iron <b>tie-bars.</b> The transom kept the longitudinals from getting too close together; the tie rods stopped them spreading too far apart. In later years the tie rods were replaced by strap bolts. These were bolted to the transoms and passed through a hole drilled through the longitudinal to a nut on the outside.|$|R
40|$|The dome-drum {{system of}} the "Regina Montis Regalis" Basilica of Vicoforte has {{suffered}} over the years from significant structural problems, partly due to settlements of the building induced progressively by newly built masses. In 1983, concerns over the severe settlement and cracking phenomena affecting the structure prompted the decision to undertake inspection, monitoring and strengthening interventions. The strengthening intervention, put in place in years 1985 - 1987, consists of 56 active steel <b>tie-bars,</b> for a total cross-sectional area of 3200 mm 2, which are placed within holes drilled in the masonry {{at the top of}} the drum along 14 tangents around the perimeter. The bars were slightly tensioned right after their placing. A static monitoring system was set up to measure strains and stresses in the masonry structure, crack propagation, as well as tensile loads in the reinforcing bars. The bars were re-tensioned in 1997 to compensate for stress losses. The monitoring program of the Basilica started in 1983, in order to assess the efficacy of the interventions over time, but only in 2004 the acquisition procedure was automatized. The instruments of the monitoring system can be subdivided in two groups: i) instruments for the measurement of displacements, strains and cracks; ii) instruments for measuring boundary conditions. The first group includes: 12 Linear Variable Displacement Transducers (LVDTs) applied to the main cracks at the impost of the dome and to the biggest west crack at the extrados; 20 pressure cells to determinate the stress variation in the masonry; 56 load cells installed at the ends of the active <b>tie-bars</b> to control their stress condition and 2 wire gauges at the impost of the dome to assess the overall geometry of the structure. The second group of instruments includes: 24 temperature sensors (17 located inside the walls and 8 externally). Data acquired from monitoring systems are inevitably affected by the environmental conditions and many other factors. Therefore, environmental fluctuations and trends have to be separated by variations induced by possible damage in the structure or tension loss in the reinforcement system. To this aim, interpolating functions helped to interpret the data of the monitoring system. A special emphasis has been put on the investigation of the tension loss occurring in the <b>tie-bars</b> strengthening system, as well as on its correlation with the crack openings. The long-term evolution in time of all the monitored parameters, and their correlation analysis, are relevant to a lifecycle assessment referred to the <b>tie-bars</b> strengthening intervention...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} longitudinal shear transfer mechanism in composite shallow cellular floor beams. The shear transfer mechanism is different with the headed shear studs used in composite construction. The shear resisting properties and behaviour of the shear transfer mechanism {{has not been}} studied previously. Experimental and analytical {{studies were carried out}} with the aims of improving and optimizing the design details, and advancing the method of shear connection in shallow floor beam construction. The composite shallow cellular floor beam investigated in this research is a new type of beam fabricated by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees along the web. The shear connections of this type of composite beam are formed by the web openings, which transfer longitudinal shear force. Four types of these shear connections were studied: concrete-infill-only, <b>tie-bar,</b> ducting and web-welded-stud shear connections. In total, 24 push-out tests were performed in two test series to investigate the load-slip behaviour and shear resistance of the shear connections under direct shear force. The failure mechanisms of the two forms of shear connections were extensively studied, which lead {{to the development of a}} design method for the composite action. The concrete infill element passing through the web opening is subject to a complex three-dimensional stress state, and it is difficult to analyse it using the mathematical model rather than empirical formula. Finite Element Analysis of the concrete-infill-only shear connection was performed with a parametric study to further verify the design method that has been developed. Two flexural tests were carried out on a full-scale composite shallow cellular floor beam with a solid slab. The shear connections investigated in the flexural tests were: concrete-infill-only and <b>tie-bar</b> shear connections passed through the web. The behaviour and performance of the shear connections in the flexural tests were compared with those in the push-out tests. The degree of shear connection of the two flexural tests was determined in the back analysis using plastic theory with measured material properties. Based on the findings of the push-out tests and flexural tests, two design methods of deflection check and moment resistance were developed for composite shallow cellular floor beams at the serviceability limit state and the ultimate limit state respectively. The deflection check design method is based on the uncracked section properties of the composite beam. The moment resistance design method developed in this thesis is compatible with the design methods of BS 5950 and Eurocode 4 (EC 4) ...|$|E

40|$|The shear {{transferring}} {{mechanisms of}} composite shallow cellular floor beams are different with the conventional headed shear studs, {{and have not}} been investigated previously. This paper presents the experimental and analytical studies of the shear transferring mechanisms with the aims to provide information on their shear resistance and behaviour. The composite shallow cellular floor beam is {{a new type of}} composite floor beam that consists of an asymmetric steel section with circular web openings and concrete slabs incorporated between the top and bottom flange. The unique feature of the web openings allows <b>tie-bars,</b> building services and ducting to pass through the structural depth of the floor beam, creating an ultra-shallow floor beam structure. The shear connection of the composite shallow cellular floor beam is formed innovatively by the web openings, as the in-situ concrete passes through the web openings may or may not include the <b>tie-bars</b> or ducting to transfer the longitudinal shear force. In total, 24 push-out tests were carried out to investigate the shear connection under the direct shear force. The effect of loading cycles on the shear connection was also investigated. The failure mechanisms of the shear connection were extensively studied, which had {{led to the development of}} a calculation method of shear resistance for the shear connection...|$|R
5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic <b>tie-bars</b> to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|R

Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by iron cramps were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums. Radial sections of brick walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century.|$|R

The unique features of this system are circular and elongated web openings that allow <b>tie-bars,</b> building services and ducts passing through the structural depth of the beam. For the composite beam in bending, the longitudinal shear force is transferred by a unique shear mechanism which results from the special configuration of the beam, and shear connectors, if they are present. The work reported in this paper includes a total of 16 full-scale push-out tests aimed at investigating the longitudinal shear behaviour of these beams and the effects of additional shear connectors. A theoretical analysis was also performed to investigate the failure mechanism of the system...|$|R

40|$|Derivatives of one triterpene family, the hopane family, {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in prokaryotes; {{they may be}} localized in membranes, playing there the same role as sterols play in eukaryotes, {{as a result of}} their similar size, rigidity, and amphiphilic character. Their biosynthesis embodies many primitive features compared to that of sterols and could have evolved toward the latter once aerobic conditions had been established. Membrane reinforcement appears to be achieved in other prokaryotes by other mechanisms, involving either approximately 40 -A-long rigid hydrocarbon chains terminated by one polar group acting like a peg through the double-layer or similar chains terminated by two polar groups acting like <b>tie-bars</b> across the membrane. These inserts can be tetraterpenes (e. g., carotenoids).

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{solution for the}} seismic protection of existing masonry structures is proposed and investigated through shake table tests on a natural scale wall assemblage. After a former test series carried out without reinforcement, the specimen was retrofitted using Steel Reinforced Grout. The strengthening system comprises horizontal strips of ultra-high strength steel cords, externally bonded to the masonry with hydraulic lime mortar, and connectors to transversal walls, applied within {{the thickness of the}} plaster layer. In order to assess the seismic performance of the retrofitted wall, natural accelerograms were applied with increasing intensity up to failure. Test results provide a deep understanding of the effectiveness of mortar-based composites for improving the out-of-plane seismic capacity of masonry walls, in comparison with traditional reinforcements with steel <b>tie-bars.</b> The structural implications of the proposed solution in terms of dynamic properties and damage development under earthquake loads are also discussed. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Key words: Steel plate shear wall; {{concrete}} filled {{steel tube}} column; seismic performance; energy dissipation; ductility Abstract. In {{view of the}} proposal of embedded steel plate concrete shear wall with concrete filled steel tube columns which contains a new kind shear connector of <b>tie-bars</b> through the circular holes linking concrete layers {{on both sides of}} the plate. In order to prove the seismic performance of walls with circular holes on the plate, three steel plate shear wall specimens, including the plate without holes bolted with columns, welded with columns, and the perforated plate welded with columns, were tested under cyclic loading. According to the results, the load-bearing capacity, ductility, energy dissipation, hysteretic behavior and failure phenomena were analyzed. It is showed that the load-bearing capacity of the three specimens were quite close. However, the wall with perforated steel plate has better ductility, energy dissipation and hysteretic behavior. So, it is an effective way to improve the seismic performance of walls by means of embedded perforated steel plate instead of ordinary ones...|$|R

Altogether, we use about seventy-five tons of our own iron a month here. Iron in Calcutta costs about five-eight a hundredweight; ours costs between three-four and three-eight, and on that item alone we save three thousand a month. Don't ask me how many miles of rails we own. There are fifteen hundred miles of line, and {{you can make your own}} calculation. All those things like babies' graves, down in that shed, are the moulds for the D. and O. sleepers.

50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron <b>tie-bars.</b> The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.|$|R
