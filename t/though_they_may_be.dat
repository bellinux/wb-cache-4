5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{as large as}} 4mm {{in the case of}} Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus can {{be found}} growing on lawns and old meadows {{throughout}} its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, {{as well as the}} typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E

There may be additional toxicity concerns with these precursors. 1,4-B and GBL are normally found as pure liquids, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use, e.g., as paint stripper or varnish thinner.|$|E
25|$|An {{element is}} a {{chemical}} substance {{made up of}} a particular kind of atom and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element, though it can be transmuted into another element through a nuclear reaction.

25|$|Vehicles {{that are}} {{approaching}} an intersection {{from beyond the}} subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit may be perceived with subjective constancy by the stopped driver; which means the oncoming vehicle cannot be reliably distinguished between moving or parked or give insight to time-to-collision, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> traveling at such an imprudent speed as to pose an immediate hazard.

25|$|Another {{major method}} of cost {{reduction}} was to utilize secondary airports, which are generally less congested and charge less to lease space <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{farther from the}} advertised destination. To save even more money at the airport, passengers boarded directly from the apron instead of using the jetway, saving both loading/unloading {{time as well as}} operating costs. Finally, ticket sales were entirely online. This not only saved on employee costs, but completely eliminated the need for a reservations call center.|$|E

At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor or bachelorette party. In addition to providing adult entertainment, stripping can be a form of sexual play between partners. This can be done as an impromptu event or– perhaps for a special occasion– with elaborate planning involving fantasy wear, music, special lighting, practiced dance moves, or unrehearsed dance moves.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States {{in spite of the}} ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who do not look like the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others. Actors Martin Sheen, Alexis Bledel and Cameron Diaz, for example, are Hispanic even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical Mediterranean/Southern European appearance - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.|$|E
25|$|Other breeds may be {{may not be}} {{acceptable}} by major kennel clubs {{for a variety of}} reasons, usually that they are too small in number in a particular area, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> numerous in their place of origin. These are sometimes called rare breeds, and breeders and dog owners may register their dogs with any of the very large number of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses in order to participate in the club's or business' activities. For breeds not yet recognised by one of the major kennel clubs, there are usually numerous competing breed clubs for each individual breed.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a genetic}} {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations. There is also such {{a difference between}} the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. The dog was the first domesticant and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed {{to have been}} essential at {{the early stages of}} domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{research}} and archaeology on Offa's Dyke has been undertaken {{for many years}} by the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Manchester. Interviews with Dr David Hill, broadcast in episode 1 of In Search of the Dark Ages (aired in 1979), show support for Noble's idea. Most recently Hill and Margaret Worthington have undertaken considerable research on the Dyke. Their work, though far from finished, has demonstrated {{that there is little}} evidence for the Dyke stretching from sea to sea. Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from Rushock Hill north of the Herefordshire Plain to Llanfynydd, near Mold, Flintshire, some 64 miles (103km). According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> connected with Offa's Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this. However, not all experts accept this view.|$|E
