5|$|Arjuna, {{one of the}} Pandavas, recollects a curse {{which could}} help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} for judicial review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> high number of torture victims in a just way. The sponsors of the bill tried to amend it in 2014 to expand its scope to all claims of torture by police in Chicago, but were unable to get support in the state house. They will try again.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E

25|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{should not}} be used to treat uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Oral antibiotics are not a sufficient response to bacteria that cause this condition and have significant side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection.

25|$|To date, the National Herbarium of New South Wales {{continues}} to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> taxon as having species rank, referring {{to it as}} B.cunninghamii.

25|$|Hypothermia can occur.

25|$|People whose limbs {{no longer}} {{adequately}} respond to compression therapy may be candidates for suction assisted lipectomy (SAL). This procedure {{has been called}} liposuction for lymphedema and is specifically adapted to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> advanced condition. SAL employs a different operative technique and requires significant therapy and compression garment care that must be administered by a therapist experienced in the technique.|$|E

25|$|Antibiotics by mouth {{should not}} be used to treat {{uncomplicated}} acute otitis externa. Antibiotics by mouth are not a sufficient response to bacteria which cause this condition and have significant side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection. In contrast, topical products can <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> condition. Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics can be used in case of severe soft tissue swelling extending into the face and neck and may hasten recovery.|$|E

25|$|Due to bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) in the European beef industry, the use of animal-derived products to feed cattle is now severely restricted. Large quantities of waste animal meat and bone meal (MBM), also known as animal flour, have to be safely disposed of or transformed. The production of cement kilns, together with the incineration, is to date {{one of the two}} main ways to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> solid effluent of the food industry.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2015, the FDA {{approved}} sirolimus {{to treat}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects {{women of childbearing}} age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.|$|E
25|$|As swine {{influenza}} is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required. Instead, veterinary efforts {{are focused on}} preventing {{the spread of the}} virus throughout the farm, or to other farms. Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to <b>treat</b> <b>this</b> disease, which although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections in influenza-weakened herds.|$|E
