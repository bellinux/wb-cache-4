5|$|His {{importance}} had dwindled {{with the}} victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, {{there was a new}} chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> generally accepted by scholars.|$|E
25|$|The killing {{has been}} dated to 1016, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> it falls under in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Chronicle of John of Worcester and the Historia Regum. Historian A. A. M. Duncan {{has argued that}} this date is unreliable. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, {{reflecting}} closely the source for the Historia Regum and the Worcester Chronicle on this entry, does not say that Uhtred died in this year, merely adding as an aside that Uhtred and Thurcytel were later killed despite having submitted to Cnut in this year. The location of this killing is given as Wiheal. This {{has been identified as}} Wighill, a place just north-west of the Roman road north of Tadcaster but south of York. This identity however is far from secure, an alleged weak point being that the early spellings of Wighill (e.g. Wichele) do not resemble De Obsessiones Wiheal very closely. Another possibility is Worrall near Sheffield, spelled Wihala and Wihale in the Domesday Book.|$|E

500|$|According to Souders, Jonathan Kent's {{death had}} been {{requested}} by executive producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar at the [...] "beginning of the season", {{and that the}} idea was specifically planned to be featured in the show's 100th episode.

500|$|Old Swedish (Swedish: fornsvenska) is {{the term}} used for the medieval Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that Västgötalagen ("the Västgöta Law") is {{believed}} to have been compiled for the first time. It is among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script and the oldest Swedish law codes. Old Swedish is divided into äldre fornsvenska (1225–1375) and yngre fornsvenska (1375–1526), [...] "older" [...] and [...] "younger" [...] Old Swedish Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Christian church and various monastic orders, introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords. With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century, Middle Low German became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of Low German-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from Danish (at the time much more similar than today's language).|$|E
