5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

It found that people living outside of Rockhampton, male, those with higher education levels, married, those with higher income level, or fully employed tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for work at home; people living in Rockhampton, those within the youngest group (18 - 24), or with secondary education level or higher tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for education; people living in Rockhampton, those within the youngest group, never married, or unemployed tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for entertainment; males, people within the youngest group, those with lower family income, or either semi-employed or unemployed tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for information search; females, people with no children, or lower family income tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for communication through email; married people tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet for financial management; and people within 25 - 39 year old group, with higher education levels tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Internet <b>more</b> for on- line purchases. It is suggested that further research should be conducted to monitor the youngest age group in home Internet use for entertainment and information search...|$|R

It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{builders}} {{began to}} lean towards specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops. They preferred <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> 8 and 16 stops in their specifications and wider pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound than was {{common in the}} 18th century. Organs began {{to be built in}} concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.|$|E

It also allowed students <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> scholarships and grants and made donors and students eligible for various tax benefits.

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E

It wants the police to be able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Hugh Hancock, {{the founder}} of Strange Company, {{launched}} a new website, machinima.com. The new name surprised the community; a misspelled contraction of machine cinema (machinema), the term machinima was intended to dissociate in-game filming from a specific engine. The misspelling stuck because it also referenced anime. The new site featured tutorials, interviews, articles, and the exclusive release of Tritin Films' Quad God. The first film made with Quake III Arena, Quad God {{was also the first}} to be distributed as recorded video frames, not game-specific instructions. This change was initially controversial among machinima producers who preferred the smaller size of demo files. However, demo files required a copy of the game to view. The more accessible traditional video format broadened Quad Gods viewership, and the work was distributed on CDs bundled with magazines. Thus, id's decision to protect Quake IIIs code inadvertently caused machinima creators <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> general solutions and thus widen their audience. Within a few years, machinima films were almost exclusively distributed in common video file formats.|$|E

5|$|Mason {{was named}} one of his state's delegates to the Constitutional Convention and {{traveled}} to Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the document bear his stamp, as he {{was active in the}} convention for months before deciding that he could not sign it. He cited the lack of a bill of rights most prominently in his Objections, but also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a supermajority for navigation acts, which might force exporters of tobacco <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> expensive American ships. He failed to attain those objectives there, and again at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce one during the First Congress in 1789, and it was ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, in the 20th and 21st centuries, Mason has come to be recognized for his contributions to the United States, and to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of the}} first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E

Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.|$|E

5|$|When Sol Cohen bought both Amazing and Fantastic {{in early}} 1965, {{he decided to}} {{maximize}} profits by filling the magazines almost entirely with reprints. Cohen had acquired second serial rights from Ziff-Davis to all stories that had been printed in both magazines, {{and also in the}} companion magazines such as Fantastic Adventures. Joseph Wrzos, the new editor, persuaded Cohen that at least one new story should appear in each issue; there was sufficient inventory left over from Goldsmith's tenure for this to be done without acquiring new material. Readers initially approved of the policy, since it made available some well-loved stories from earlier decades that had not been reprinted elsewhere. Both of Wrzos's successors, Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg, were unable to persuade Cohen <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>more</b> new fiction.|$|E
