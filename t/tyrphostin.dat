Background We investigate the effects of <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126, an inhibitor of {{tyrosine kinase}} activity, on the renal dysfunction and injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the kidney.

Biochemical markers of renal dysfunction and injury were measured and renal sections assessed for renal injury. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and formation of nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP) ribose (PAR) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Rat proximal tubular cells (PTCs) were incubated with interferon- (100 IU/mL), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (10 g/mL), and with increasing concentrations of <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126 (0. 0001 – 1 mmol/L) for 24 hours.

Methods: In cultured rat granulosa cells, the effect of <b>tyrphostin</b> on LH-, dibutyryl cyclic AMP ((Bu) 2 cAMP) - or forskolin-stimulated tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) activities was examined by using a fibrin autography technique. In an in vivo system, <b>tyrphostin</b> was injected into the bursal cavity of the ovary in pregnant mare serum gonadotropin-treated rats, just before human chorionic gonadotropin administration. After 24 h, the number of oocytes in the oviduct was counted and the tyrphostin-treated ovaries were examined histologically.

In this study, we have investigated the intracellular mechanism of PACAP-induced relaxation in this muscle. PACAP induced an apamin-sensitive relaxation of the longitudinal muscle. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein at 10 μm and <b>tyrphostin</b> 25 at 30 μm, but not the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp- 8 -bromoadenosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphorothioate at 30 μm significantly inhibited the PACAP-induced relaxation to 60 % and 25 % of control values, respectively. PACAP did not increase the cyclic AMP content of the muscle. <b>Tyrphostin</b> 25 at 10 μm significantly inhibited the relaxation of longitudinal muscle induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS), to 50 % of control values. Apamin at 1 μm, an antagonist of small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, also inhibited the relaxation, to 42 % of control values. The inhibitory effects of <b>tyrphostin</b> 25 and apamin were not additive (44 % of control values). PACAP induced an apamin-sensitive, slow hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of the muscle. <b>Tyrphostin</b> 25 at 3 μm inhibited this PACAP-induced hyperpolarization. <b>Tyrphostin</b> 25 at 10 μm and genistein at 10 μm inhibited the apamin-sensitive inhibitory junction potentials induced by a single pulse of EFS. The PACAP-induced relaxation of longitudinal muscle occurred with a concomitant decrease in intracellular Ca 2 + levels ([Ca 2 +]i). <b>Tyrphostin</b> 25 at 10 μm and apamin at 1 μm abolished these PACAP-induced responses. From these findings it is suggested that the activation of tyrosine kinase is involved in PACAP-induced relaxation of longitudinal muscle from rat distal colon, ‘upstream of’ the activation of apamin-sensitive K+ channels...|$|E
40|$|Using whole-cell and cell-attached {{recording}} configurations, {{the role}} of phosphorylation in leptin activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels was examined in the rat CRI-G 1 insulinoma cell line. Whole-cell current clamp recordings demonstrated that, following dialysis with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue 5 ′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP; 3 – 5 mM), the leptin-induced hyperpolarization and increase in K+ conductance were completely inhibited. Under current clamp conditions, application of the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor H- 7 (10 μM) {{had no effect on}} the resting membrane potential or slope conductance of CRI-G 1 insulinoma cells and did not occlude the actions of leptin. Application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (10 μM), <b>tyrphostin</b> B 42 (10 μM) and herbimycin A (500 nM) all resulted in activation of KATP channels. In cell-attached recordings, the presence of <b>tyrphostin</b> B 42 (10 μM) in the pipette solution activated tolbutamide-sensitive KATP channels in CRI-G 1 cells. In contrast, the inactive analogues of genistein and <b>tyrphostin</b> B 42 were without effect. The serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (50 nM) and cyclosporin A (1 μM) did not prevent or reverse leptin activation of KATP channels. In contrast, whole-cell dialysis with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (500 μM) prevented the actions of both leptin and <b>tyrphostin</b> B 42. In conclusion, leptin activation of KATP channels appears to require inhibition of tyrosine kinases and subsequent dephosphorylation. This process is likely to occur prior to activation of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) as wortmannin prevented activation of KATP channels by <b>tyrphostin</b> B 42...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} monolayers of parental 3 T 3 cells and 3 T 3 cells expressing {{one of three}} {{transfected}} cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (NCAM, N- cadherin, and L 1) as a culture substrate for rat cerebellar neurons. A number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been tested {{for their ability to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth over parental 3 T 3 monolayers which we show to be partly dependent on neuronal integrin receptor function, as compared with neurite outgrowth stimulated by the above three CAMs. Whereas genistein (100 microM), lavendustin A (20 microM), and <b>tyrphostins</b> 34 and 47 (both at 150 microM) had no effect on integrin dependent or CAM stimulated neurite outgrowth, the erbstatin analogue (10 - 15 micrograms/ml) and <b>tyrphostins</b> 23 and 25 (both at 150 microM) specifically inhibited the response stimulated by all three CAMs. CAM stimulated neurite outgrowth can be accounted for by a G-protein- dependent activation of neuronal calcium channels; experiments with agents that directly activate this pathway localized the erbstatin analogue site of action upstream of the G-protein and calcium channels, whereas <b>tyrphostins</b> have sites of action downstream from calcium channel activation. These data suggest that activation of an erbstatin sensitive tyrosine kinase is an important step upstream of calcium channel activation in the second messenger pathway underlying the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by a variety of CAMs, and that this kinase is not required for integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that autocrine growth of human prostate cancer cell line DU 145 is dependent on TGF (EGF) /EGFR loop. However, the participation of several other growth factors in proliferation of DU 145 cells has been also proposed. We employed two selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (<b>tyrphostins)</b> : AG 1024 (an IGFIR inhibitor) and SU 1498 (a VEGFR 2 inhibitor) for growth regulation of DU 145 cells, cultured in chemically defined DMEM/F 12 medium. Both the tested compounds inhibited autocrine growth of DU 145 cells at similar concentration values (IC 50 approximately 2. 5 microM). The <b>tyrphostins</b> arrested cell growth of DU 145 in G 1 phase, similarly as inhibitors of EGFR. However, in contrast to selective inhibitors of EGFR, neither AG 1024, nor SU 1498 (at concentration < or = 10 microM) decreased {{the viability of the}} investigated cells. These results strongly suggest that autocrine growth of DU 145 cells is stimulated by, at least, three autocrine loops: TGFalpha(EGF) /EGFR, IGFII/IGFIr and VEGF/VEGFR 2 (VEGFR 1). These data support the hypothesis of multi-loops growth regulation of metastatic prostate cancer cell lines...|$|R
40|$|Background: Formation of {{cholesterol}} oxidation products is a suggested mechanism of neurodegenerative disorders. Neuronal cell death is mediated by an increased release of excitotoxic glutamate from the presynaptic nerve endings. Tyrosine-specific protein kinases modulate neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminals. <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 126 has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. However, it remains uncertain whether <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126 has a preventive {{effect on the}} alteration of nerve terminal function induced by cholesterol oxidation products. Methods: The present study was performed to assess the effect {{of cholesterol}} oxidation products against nerve terminal function using synaptosomes isolated from rat cerebrum. We determined the preventive effect of <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126 against oxysterol toxicity by measuring the effects on the glutamate release, depolarization of the membrane potential, changes in Ca 2 + levels, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Results: Synaptosomes treated with 7 -ketocholesterol or 25 -hydroxycholesterol exhibited a sustained release of glutamate, depolarization of membrane potential, early rapid increase in cellular Ca 2 + levels and decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Those responses were concentration-dependent. Treatment of <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126 interfered with alteration of synaptosomal functions and decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity induced by 7 -ketocholesterol or 25 -hydroxycholesterol. Conclusions: The results show that 7 -ketocholesterol and 25 -hydroxycholesterol seem to cause the release o...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the splanchnic artery occlusion (SAO) shock mediated injury. SAO shock was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 45 min. After 1 h of reperfusion, SAO shocked rats developed a significant fall in mean arterial blood pressure. Ileum analysis revealed that SAO shock {{is characterized by a}} significant (P< 0. 01) induction in TNF-alpha and IL- 1 ileum levels, while immunohistochemistry examination of necrotic ileum demonstrated a marked increase in the immunoreactivity in intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM- 1) and nitrotyrosine formation. A significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity (P< 0. 01) was also observed in rats subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 126, given intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia at the dose of 5 mg/kg, significantly improved mean arterial blood pressure, markedly reduced TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta levels and the positive staining of ICAM- 1 into the reperfused ileum. <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 126 significantly improved the histological status of the reperfused tissue. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that <b>tyrphostin</b> AG 126 exerts multiple protective effects in splanchnic artery occlusion/reperfusion shock and suggests that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be a candidate for consideration as a therapeutic intervention for ischemia-reperfusion injury...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a potent inducer of {{apoptosis}} and activates protein tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Previous studies suggest that cytokine receptors are potential effectors for anti-apoptotic signals, {{but it has not}} previously been determined whether cytokine receptors regulate down-stream protein kinases. To investigate the role of EGFR on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and its downstream protein kinases, we blocked EGFR activation with <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 1478, a highly selective EGFR inhibitor. We determined that <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 1478 accelerated hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in A 431 cells, with activation of caspases 3 and 9, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Hydrogen peroxide induced-activation of EGFR, Akt/PKB, MAPK, and Bad (both Ser- 112 and Ser- 136 residues) were inhibited by <b>Tyrphostin</b> AG 1478. These results suggest that early upstream signaling events, such as EGFR activation, exert anti-apoptotic effects by regulating MAPK, Akt/PKB, and phosphorylation of Bad...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Stimulation {{of several}} human and murme hematopoietically derived cell lines with anti-Faa {{antibodies}} induced increased tyrosine phosphoryla-Lion of {{a panel of}} proteins observed in whole-cell lysates. In the human T cell line Jurkat, the activity of a 56 -kDa tyrosine kinase was likewise activated by anti-Fas antibodies. Immunoprecipitation studies of anti-Fag-stimulated human Jurkat and murine 2 B 4. 1 1 T cells revealed activation of the Src-family tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn. Fas receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pl 2 O c-cbl proto-onco-gene product was observed in Jurkat T cells. Phar-macological experiments demonstrated that pretreatment of Jurkat cells with <b>tyrphostins</b> inhib-ited Fag-induced apoptosis; likewise, Lck activity was inhibited by <b>tyrphostins</b> in a dose-dependent fashion. Finally, Lck derived from unstiinulated Jurkat T cells formed stable complexes with the intracellular do-main of the Fas receptor.

40|$|AbstractTyrosine kinase inhibitors {{have been}} widely used to probe the role of {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation in cellular signalling.

We propose, therefore, that results obtained using tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be interpreted with caution, particularly if used at concentrations sufficient to inhibit these non-protein kinase-dependent events...|$|R
