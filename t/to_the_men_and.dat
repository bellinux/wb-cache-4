5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a 'pilot's luff'. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E

5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Japanese attacks, the {{defensive}} line held but on 15 February, with supplies (food, water and ammunition) running low all commanders agreed that counter-attacks would be fruitless. To spare the civilian population of the city further hardship, {{the decision was made}} to surrender the Allied garrison. The order to surrender came as a surprise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> some fled, fearing the Japanese would not take prisoners, others had to be pressured into laying down their arms. Some elements of the division were able to escape; Harold Atcherley (an intelligence officer with the division) who was ordered off the island. On 15 February, the division ceased to exist and its men went into Japanese captivity; the division was never reformed. Over the next three years, over a third of the men of the division died in Japanese captivity. Most notably, on 11 November, Beckwith-Smith succumbed to diphtheria while in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women who were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E
25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were supposed to work and play in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war savings stamps and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. If you were a young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E

500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks.

500|$|Leaving port {{with a broad}} {{white flag}} bearing the motto [...] "Free Trade and Sailors' Rights", Chesapeake met with Shannon near 5pm that afternoon. During six minutes of firing, each ship managed two full {{broadside}}s. Chesapeakes first broadside was fired while the ship was heeling, causing most hits on Shannon to strike the water or waterline causing little damage to Shannon although carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. A second round of fire was more effective, landing hits on Shannon 's 12 pounder shot locker. Chesapeake 's 32 lb carronades punished Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannon 's nine pounder bow gun. However Chesapeake suffered far more heavily in the exchange as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews and crippling losses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> officers on Chesapeakes quarterdeck. A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel itself was destroyed. At the same time, her foretopsail halyard was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{wrote of}} the 52nd in his diary that [...] "it is evident that not only the officers, but that each {{individual}} soldier, knows perfectly {{what he has to}} do; the discipline is carried on without severity, the officers are attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> the men to the officers." [...] This {{had much to do with}} the method of training; unlike other regiments, light infantry officers drilled with the men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines, including weapons training. The ranks also received additional training, and were encouraged to develop initiative and self-direction; while skirmishing in the field they would need to react without direct orders. While most regiments of the time fought in tight formation, allowing easy administration of orders, light infantry worked in small groups, in advance of the main line, so complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders. Consequently, the bugle became the emblem of the light infantry regiments.|$|E
