5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> grade the turnpike traversed.

Two other stages had summit arrivals, stage 7 to Pescocostanzo and the demanding stage 16 climbing time trial to Plan de Corones, the summit of which the Giro had never before visited. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the race's last day, would keep the race hotly contested to the end.|$|E
5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E

5|$|When the Green Lantern Coaster was announced, {{few details}} were {{released}} about the ride's drop angle other {{than it would}} be the Southern Hemisphere's steepest. On 2 November, Warner Bros. Movie World announced via Facebook that the ride would have a drop angle of 120°. On 27 November, Warner Bros.

Later that day they confirmed the drop would be 122.4° instead of the originally announced 120°. Following the soft opening television commercials began advertising the ride. On 20 December, Warner Bros. Movie World revised the angle yet again to 120.5°; this was the final measurement given. Only Takabisha exceeded it with a drop of 121°.|$|E

5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

Also on 17 September 2011, the DC Super Heroes Store opened adjacent to , Batwing Spaceshot and Green Lantern Coaster. By early October, most of the support structure and the lift hill were complete. By the end of October, the ride's construction was complete and work had begun on the entrance pathway. In early November, six trains arrived on site. Another was showcased by S Worldwide at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. Kevin Rohwer, an S Worldwide spokesman, stated that the ride would be ready on 15 December 2011. On 28 November 2011, testing began. The ride entered a soft opening phase on 16 December 2011, before its official opening on 23 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Kilmersdon valley {{consists}} of alluvium deposits. Above these, {{on both sides of}} all of the valleys, is a band of shales and clays from the Penarth group from the Triassic period. Most of the upland in this area is Lias Limestone (white and blue) while the highest part, above 130m, south of Haydon, is an outcrop of Inferior Oolitic Limestone, both are from the Jurassic period. <b>The</b> <b>steepest</b> slopes of both the Kilmersdon and Snail’s Bottom valleys have frequently slipped. Below these rocks are the coal bearing Carboniferous strata. Haydon is an outlying settlement of Radstock built to house miners from the local pit. The disused railway line and inclined railway at Haydon are important elements in the Kilmersdon valley east of Haydon. The modern landscape has a less maintained and ‘rougher’ character and texture than neighbouring agricultural areas caused mainly by the remnants of the coal industry and its infrastructure and changes in agricultural management. Disturbance caused by coal mining and the railways and the subsequent end of mining and abandonment of the railways has created valuable habitats for nature conservation.|$|E

Internationally, The Last Stand topped the box office in 26 {{countries}} with a total gross of $76.1 million overall, but suffered competition from The Da Vinci Code, which retained the top spot in most markets, and beat The Last Stand in international gross that weekend with $91 million.

5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E
