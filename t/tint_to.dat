5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E

5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's {{youngest}} rock layer. It {{was formed}} after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded {{and as a}} result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} taxa can {{be divided}} into three main groups; the S. e. caesia group of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the S. e. europaea group of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan and northern China and the S. e. sinensis group of southern and eastern China and Taiwan. These may have been geographically isolated from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap. The descriptions below are of the male. The female is usually slightly duller with a brown <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the eyestripe and paler underparts, although the sexes are very similar in the S. e. sinensis group.|$|E
5|$|The plain {{appearance}} of the garden warbler means {{that it can be}} confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible. Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour. M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E

50|$|Primers {{can usually}} be <b>tinted</b> <b>to</b> a close match with {{the color of the}} {{finishing}} paint. If the finishing paint is a deep color, tinting the primer can reduce the number of layers of finishing paint that are necessary for good uniformity across the painted surface.|$|R
25|$|The shield is oblong, {{about one}} third of the total length of the animal. The shield is rounded in front, angular behind, and forming an angle of about 80 degrees when in motion, usually of a similar <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the body, but boldly marbled or maculate with black, {{somewhat}} concentrically and interruptedly ridged around a sub-posterior nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The Dark Crystal was {{the last}} film in which cinematographer Oswald Morris {{involved}} himself in before retiring. He shot all the footage with a 'light flex', a unit {{placed in front of}} the camera which gave a faint colour <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> each scene in order to give the film a more fairy tale atmosphere similar to Froud's original paintings.|$|E
25|$|Willett Enos Rotzell {{professor}} of Botany and Zoology at the Hahnemann Medical College said the Asian race has skin color {{ranging from a}} yellowish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> an olive shade, with black and coarse hair with a circular cross section, an absent or scanty beard, a brachycephalic skull, prominent cheek bones and a broad face. Rotzell said that the Asian race has its original home in Asia.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{general rules}} of thumb were {{developed}} for what color {{to use in}} certain scenes. Many of them were obvious, but a few artistic. Specific names were given <b>to</b> <b>tints</b> <b>to</b> specify certain colors. Striking effects could be achieved by both tinting and toning sequences.|$|R
50|$|With {{a running}} time of 35 minutes, In Nacht und Eis was three {{times longer than}} the average film of 1912. Shot in black and white, various scenes were <b>tinted</b> <b>to</b> heighten their impact, such as night scenes in dark blue and a shot of a stoker feeding a burner in red.|$|R
50|$|In 2006's Early Work of Raphael, Julia Cartwright {{suggests}} it may betray {{the influence of}} Timoteo Viti in the gold <b>tinting</b> <b>to</b> the green wings of Michael, while the sinners in the background suggest that Raphael may have consulted an illustrated volume of Dante's Inferno. The punishments depicted reflect Dante's treatment of hypocrites and thieves.|$|R
25|$|Manifestations {{may include}} {{enlarged}} spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders or bone lesions {{that may be}} painful, severe neurological complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the skin, anemia, low blood platelet count, and yellow fatty deposits on {{the white of the}} eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.|$|E

25|$|Tinamous have a pneumaticized {{skeleton}} with a sternal keel, 16–18 cervical vertebrae, and fused thoracic vertebrae. They have poor circulation, {{evidenced by}} a greenish <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the skin. They also have relatively the smallest hearts and lungs of all birds, comprising only 1.6–3.1% {{of their body}} weight, whereas the equivalent in a domestic chicken is 12%. Despite their poor flying ability, the percentage of their body mass that is muscle is 28.6–40%, {{which is similar to}} that of hummingbirds. The preen gland is small and tufted. The male has a corkscrew shaped penis, similar to those of the ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles. The female has a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season.|$|E

25|$|Throughout history other wood types, {{including}} chestnut, pine, redwood, and acacia, {{have been}} used in crafting winemaking vessels, particularly large fermentation vats. However none of these wood types possess the compatibility with wine that oak has demonstrated in combining its water tight, yet slightly porous, storage capabilities with the unique flavor and texture characteristic that it can impart to the wine that it is in contact with. Chestnut is very high in tannins and is too porous as a storage barrel and must be coated with paraffin to prevent excessive wine loss through evaporation. Redwood is too rigid to bend into the smaller barrel shapes and imparts an unpleasant flavor. Acacia imparts a yellow <b>tint</b> <b>to</b> the wine. Other hardwoods like apple and cherry wood have an off putting smell. Austrian winemakers have a history of using acacia barrels. Historically, chestnut was used by Beaujolais, Italian and Portuguese wine makers. Some Rhône winemakers still use paraffin coated chestnut barrels but the coating minimizes any effect from the wood making its function similar to a neutral concrete vessel. In Chile there are traditions for using barrels made of rauli wood but it is beginning to fall out of favor due to the musky scent it imparts on wine.|$|E
