25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E
6000|$|... "G'long, Smiler," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said,</b> and {{the horse}} went forward. The man leaned forward and raised his lamp to Jack's face.|$|E
60|$|And {{he put a}} twenty-dollar gold {{piece in}} the driver's hand. After a moment <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> he could not make change.|$|E
30|$|Our driving {{patients}} lived both {{in urban}} and rural areas and half of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they would have had no one else to help them with driving if they stopped.|$|R
2500|$|... 84% of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> severe low {{temperatures}} during both {{phases of the}} field trial affected the distance that could be driven between charges, but despite that, {{four out of five}} participants told the researchers they thought the Mini E was suitable for winter use.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> Duggan {{ran toward}} him with outstretched arms. The car, a BMW, clipped {{him with the}} wing mirror. He appears to have fallen, but got up and {{continued}} running toward the traffic that was heading into town. Both <b>drivers</b> reported <b>the</b> incidents to police.|$|R
6000|$|Seth's eyes glistened with delight, {{and when}} he had gone to his room <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> in a tone of {{satisfaction}} to his comrades: ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe Black {{was called}} upon {{immediately}} afterward, {{and when he}} had concluded and been given a round of cheers, {{as in the case of}} the other speakers, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> gravely: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are heartily welcome," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said,</b> {{mounting}} his box. [...] "I wish I {{could do}} as well every day; but these are bad times for us, and money is precious scarce, I can tell you." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> {{in focus}} groups that the {{security}} threat from a suspicious item on the train was conditional on its being an actual explosive device—the likelihood of which they rated as extremely low. At the same time, they felt that the perceived impact from carrying out certain security tasks, such as panic amongst passengers, was both more immediate and probable.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the bridge {{had begun to}} decay. In September 1989 debris from the bridge {{impacted}} cars, injuring three. By this point nets had been placed under the bridge. A city engineer said he suspected vandals may have thrown the concrete, but one of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they were watching the bridge after {{they were forced to}} stop and saw no one on the bridge.|$|R
25|$|Before <b>the</b> test, <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they {{expected}} range and charging time limitations to be a problem, however, during the actual trials these issues were only {{felt to be}} limitations in very few specific cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take care {{you don't}} stick your nose too near a fire some time, and get one point too many," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> {{with a smile}} as he ascended the stairs wearily, and Seth called after him: ...|$|E
6000|$|Forester was not willing, however, to have Marco ride outside any longer; {{and so they}} {{contrived}} to {{make room}} for him within. As Marco descended from his high seat, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> to him, as he passed him, in a low voice, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the sea," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and them lights down yonder is at Lea Claxton, {{where the}} fisher-folk live; and over there," [...] {{pointing}} with his whip {{to a long}} dark shadow on the waters, [...] "is the Oilywoite." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> sleigh <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> that if {{they made}} good time during the {{afternoon}} they would reach the village of Bojowak by five or six o'clock. Here he was certain they would hear further of the exploring party.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Driver</b> has <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> {{album was}} {{influenced}} by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of <b>the</b> 1980s. <b>Driver</b> <b>said</b> {{in an interview that}} the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking [...] "1980s retrofuture noir." ...|$|R
25|$|On 24 September 2008, Georgian police {{detained}} a Russian military truck {{near the}} village of Odzisi in the Mtskheta Municipality. The truck contained ammunitions and explosives. <b>The</b> Russian <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> he had lost his way. He was handed over to OSCE observers.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{like to go}} to Jane's, of course," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> to me with a {{friendly}} nod as he reached the High Street: and not liking to confess my forgetfulness of Jane, I responded with warmth that Jane's would, no doubt, exactly suit me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't {{the best}} way to do it, my boy," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> in a kindly tone. [...] "I've been {{thinking}} about your plan of getting into the Department, and come to the conclusion that, seeing's you're so set on it, we'd better lend a hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lish Davis {{would not}} be content until the boy gave an {{exhibition}} {{of what he had}} learned in the way of gymnastic exercises during the morning, and when this had been brought to a close amid the applause of all present, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> in a tone of satisfaction: ...|$|E
60|$|Seth obeyed {{without delay}} what was {{little less than}} a command, and, hastening to Mrs. Hanson's dwelling, {{repeated}} to his roommates and Teddy Bowser all <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> had <b>said</b> to him concerning the possibilities of aiding Jip Collins.|$|R
60|$|The stages that Mr. Wadsworth had {{mentioned}} were certainly old-fashioned and dilapidated, but each was drawn {{by a pair}} of sturdy horses, and <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> that they were perfectly safe and could make the journey to Mirror Lake without trouble. So, having transferred the baggage from the automobiles to these ancient vehicles, and having placed the touring-cars in the garage, with orders to have the damaged car repaired, our friends piled into the turnouts, and then, with various calls to the animals and loud crackings of the whips, the two stages started for Bear Camp.|$|R
3000|$|... “The {{relatively}} {{large number of}} passengers, time pressure, and reduced time to rest makes train driving during peak hours especially stressful. We do not get time to relax in the drivers’ room {{at the end of}} a round trip. There is just enough time to have a drink, and get back to the job. In contrast during off-peak hours we can have tea, chat with other drivers, watch some television and rest before going back to the next journey”. In the focus groups, <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> that owing to additional workload and fatigue, there was a greater likelihood that they made mistakes or took shortcuts in following a security SOP if a suspicious item was reported during peak hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "There ain't any Santa Claus," [...] whined the boy. [...] "You've got old false billy goat's {{whiskers}} on your face. I ain't no kid. What do I {{want with}} dolls and tin horses? <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> you'd have a rifle, and you haven't. I {{want to go}} home." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{we drove}} off, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> all the {{tourists}} had arrived and gone by {{while we were}} at dinner; [...] "but," [...] said he, impressively, [...] "be not disturbed by that--remain tranquil--give yourselves no uneasiness--their dust rises far before us--rest you tranquil, leave all to me--I am the king of drivers. Behold!" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and sped away, always through splendid scenery but {{occasionally}} through long ranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen--monuments {{of the huge}} emigration of other days--and here and there were up-ended boards or small piles of stones which <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> marked the resting-place of more precious remains.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> lorry <b>driver</b> {{was arrested}} pending further inquiries. Witnesses <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{made no effort}} to stop until it was too late. When {{questioned}} on this , <b>the</b> lorry <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> that he had tried to stop but the brakes would not work. Examination of the lorry showed that the brakes were not faulty, so the police checked the dash cam to see what had happened. It showed footage of <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> scrolling through music on his phone moments before the crash, he did not notice the tailback of traffic I front of him.|$|R
5000|$|According to Mr W he {{was present}} at Osman's house when he overheard a {{conversation}} between Osman & Adnan Darwiche, who told Osman {{that he would be}} <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> He <b>said</b> [...] "I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning. At three o'clock {{there are going to be}} fireworks." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{taken for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "A car {{carrying}} seven Western Heights School students Friday afternoon lunch break went out of control and overturned on a gravel road in southwest Oklahoma City, fatally injuring <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> police <b>said.</b> Steven Glenn Pope, 16, of 6674 NW 10, was dead on arrival at South Community Hospital of multiple injuries. ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{island is}} not large. Somewhere in the {{interior}} a man ahead of us had a very slow horse. I suggested that we had better go by him; but <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> the man had but a little way to go. I waited to see, wondering how he could know. Presently the man did turn down another road. I asked, [...] "How did you know he would?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{hackney-coach}} jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches usually do. The horses 'went better', <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said,</b> {{when they}} had anything before them (they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there was nothing), and so the vehicle kept behind a cart; when the cart stopped, it stopped; and when the cart went on again, it did the same. Mr. Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, don't {{distress}} {{yourself on}} the score of begging," [...] <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> with a hearty laugh. [...] "I've come to know how thin-skinned you are on that point, and ain't counting on giving either of you {{the value of a}} pin. But it so happens that a friend of mine lives in the next block, and he's got a room in his attic that he's just dying to let. I was telling him about you kids, and he'll make what I call a fair trade." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{relation}} {{to the first question}} we could see that, the AVC countermeasure that had largest influence on vehicle speed over longer distances was the radio warning message, with a speed reduction of about 8  km/h that lasted beyond 2  km. Directed warnings, as the radio message, have large impact on behaviour since its scope is limited in both space and time and hence more accurate and relevant to <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> These findings are in line with Stanley et al. [45], who found that a variable message sign had a significant speed-reducing effect of 7.4  km/h. As for the second question, the questionnaire results provided an additional explanation to the long-lasting effect of the speed reduction. Eighty-eight per cent of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> that they were made extra aware of AVC due to the radio message. Also, the radio message was associated with stress, insecurity and unsafety, probably since the radio message invoked feelings of a probable imminent and hazardous event.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1952 Le Mans race, {{when only}} 17 of the 58 {{starters}} finished, the entry driven by Leslie Johnson—a <b>driver</b> with <b>the</b> flair of Nuvolari, said Louis Chiron—and motoring journalist Tommy Wisdom took third overall behind two factory-entered Mercedes-Benz 300SLs; also first in class, ahead of Chinetti's Ferrari, and {{second in the}} Rudge-Whitworth Cup for the best performance over two consecutive years. In addition, they won the Motor Gold Challenge Cup. <b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> car was more nimble through the corners than its more exotic competitors. It delivered [...] and the engine needed no oil or water during the entire 24 hours. The car had been built from scratch in a fortnight, Menadue and his assistant Jock Reid fabricating the body {{in less than a}} week, by eye, without any drawings. Healey said: “That’s an ugly bugger, isn’t it, Roger?” ...|$|R
5000|$|April 28 05:30 {{after the}} {{accident}} - For understanding {{the cause of the}} accident, scheduler Pu Xiaojun asked Wangcun station's scheduler Zhang Fasheng, where he sent the control command to <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> and he <b>said</b> it had been sent.|$|R
