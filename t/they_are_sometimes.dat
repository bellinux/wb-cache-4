5|$|A {{number of}} artists spent {{time on the}} Quantocks in the 1860s, many of them lodging at Halsway Manor. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{referred}} to as the Idyllists. They include John William North, George John Pinwell and Frederick Walker.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{included}} {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> fortified, {{but this}} was {{frequently}} intended more for show than for defence. Manor houses existed in most European countries where feudalism existed, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> known as castles, palaces, and so on. Many buildings, such as schools, are named Manor; the reason behind {{this is because the}} building was or is close to a manor house.|$|R
5|$|Lem's works explore {{philosophical}} themes through {{speculation on}} technology, {{the nature of}} intelligence, the impossibility of communication with and understanding of alien intelligence, despair about human limitations, and humanity's place in the universe. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> presented as fiction, but others are {{in the form of}} essays or philosophical books.|$|E
5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|The quail-thrushes are {{medium-sized}} songbirds {{found in}} open forest and scrub. Adapted for ground living, they have strong legs and beaks. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{classified in the}} family Cinclosomatidae along with jewel-babblers, or united with the family Psophodidae, containing the wedgebills and whipbirds. One species reaches Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|Even when {{referring}} to a class of persons of known sex, <b>they</b> <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> used.|$|R

5|$|An animal epithet {{is a name}} used {{to label}} a person or group, by {{association}} with some perceived quality of an animal. Epithets may be formulated as similes, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as metaphors, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be pejorative, readily giving offence, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.|$|E
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. Highways) is an {{integrated}} network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and {{have always been}} maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926.|$|E

5|$|The monarch flycatchers are {{a diverse}} family of around 140 species of {{passerine}} birds found from Africa to Australia. Closely {{related to the}} drongo family Dicruridae, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> classified as a subfamily within it. Monarchs generally live in the canopy or understory in forest habitats, although one species is ground-dwelling. One species is found in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> used as runners in short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.|$|E
5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
50|$|In {{literature}} {{before the}} 1970s, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> translated as the Eight Genies. First {{described in the}} Yuan Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> probably named after the Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han.|$|R
5000|$|Albanians {{converted}} from Christianity to Islam {{not because of}} their religious feelings though instead for other opportunistic reasons or because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> forced to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Eleanor and Karla Gutchrlein (born 1910) are twin {{sisters who}} danced and acted {{together}} in several 1930s films. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> billed as [...] "The Sisters G".|$|R
5|$|There {{exists a}} large number of {{commercial}} clones of Riesling, with slightly different properties. In Germany, approximately 60 clones are allowed, and the most famous of these have been propagated from vines in the vineyards of Schloss Johannisberg. Most other countries have sourced their Riesling clones directly from Germany, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> propagated under different designations.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{cigarette}} tins in the United States of the 1920s-1930s stored 50 cigarettes. Because of this, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{referred to}} by the nickname [...] "flat fifties".|$|R
50|$|In Wales, oatcakes tend to {{resemble}} savoury pancakes. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> crumbled up {{and used as}} one of the ingredients of brewis, a staple breakfast at the time.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 and 1911 Cole made {{a series}} of films adapted from his shows. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{screened}} accompanied by lectures and songs. Cole toured Tasmania in 1911 and 1912.|$|R
5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E

2500|$|Chives {{have been}} {{cultivated}} in Europe since the Middle Ages (fifth until the 15th centuries), although their usage dates back 5000 years. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "rush leeks".|$|R
50|$|For {{the period}} 1906 to 1988 there were 29 {{documented}} water breaches. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> successfully sealed off, partly dry or sometimes with negligible inflows (less than 0.5 m³ per day).|$|R
