25|$|A {{majority}} of the General Assembly may pass articles of impeachment against a Justice, which <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>will</b> then try. Only a two-thirds majority will convict, and the Senate may punish a convicted Justice with only removal from office and prohibition on holding future office. After a Justice has been impeached by the General Assembly—but before the Senate renders a verdict on the charges—the Justice may not exercise any official function. By virtue of accepting {{a position in the}} Executive or Legislative branches of government or becoming a candidate for political office, a Justice is considered as resigned from the bench.|$|E

25|$|Not every Supreme Court nominee has {{received}} a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because {{it is clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>will</b> reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires {{at the end of the}} session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November, 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, as previously noted, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the powers}} {{granted to the}} Governor-General is the power to {{dissolve}} both houses of Parliament under Section 57 of the Constitution {{in the event that}} the House of Representatives twice passes a bill at least three months apart and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>will</b> not agree to pass the bill.

The procedure committee considers [...] "any matter relating to the procedures of the Senate referred to it by the Senate or by the President".

500|$|The Royal Assent {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>will</b> read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] doth assent to these bills." [...] If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." [...] The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.|$|E

6000|$|... "The senate proclaimed Galba emperor {{two days}} before the death of Nero; but as yet all is uncertain. There are other generals whose legions may dispute this point. Syria and Egypt may choose Vespasian; the Transalpine legions, who favoured Vindex, may {{pronounce}} for some other. The Praetorians themselves, with the sailors of the fleet, knowing that Galba has the reputation of being close fisted, may choose someone who may flatter and feast them as Nero did. As yet there is no saying what will be done, but at any rate your chief enemy is dead. Muro bids me say that some months may yet elapse before Galba comes to Rome; but that, as he has at present no imperial master, and <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>will</b> be far too busy wrangling and persecuting the adherents of the man whom but a short time since they declared to be a god, to trouble themselves about a handful of gladiators in Bruttium, he will at once collect his troops at Rhegium, and you will be entirely unmolested if you promise that your band will in no way ill treat the people. I know that they have not hitherto done so, and that they will not do so, but {{the fact that he has}} a formal engagement with you to that effect will justify him in withdrawing his troops. Indeed, he said that it would be better, perhaps, that a document should be drawn up and signed, in which you pledge yourself to peaceful courses, urging that it was but the tyranny of Nero that forced you to become fugitives, and craving that, as your band has never done any harm to the people, an amnesty may be granted you. This document will aid him when he meets Galba. He will not wait until the latter comes to Rome, but will shortly ask permission from the senate to quit his post for a time, all being quiet here, and will at once take ship to Massilia and see Galba. The new emperor is not, he says, a man bent on having his own way, but always leans on friends for advice, and he feels sure that his representations will suffice to obtain a free pardon for your band, and permission for them to leave the mountains and go wheresoever they will, so that in that case there will be nought to prevent you and your followers returning to Britain." ...|$|E
