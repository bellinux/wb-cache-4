5|$|Paleontology {{is one of}} the {{historical}} sciences, along with archaeology, geology, astronomy, cosmology, philology and history itself. This means that it aims to describe phenomena of the past and reconstruct their causes. Hence it has three main elements: description of the phenomena; developing a general <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the causes of various types of change; and applying those theories to specific facts.|$|E
5|$|Marlon Brando as Jor-El: Superman's {{biological}} father on Krypton. He has a <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the planet exploding, yet the Council refuses to listen. He dies as the planet explodes but successfully sends his infant son to Earth {{as a means}} to help the innocent. Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50million because he felt cheated out of his share of the box office profits. This stopped Brando's footage from being used in Richard Lester's version of Superman II.|$|E

5000|$|Put another way, these modal axioms {{describe}} {{in detail the}} 'accessibility relation,' [...] between two 'worlds.' That relation, [...] symbolizes that from any given 'possible world' some other 'possible worlds' may be accessible, and others may not be. [...] The accessibility relation has important uses in both the formal/theoretical aspects of modal logic (<b>theories</b> <b>about</b> 'modal logic'). It also has applications {{to a variety of}} disciplines including epistemology (<b>theories</b> <b>about</b> how people know something is true or false), metaphysics (<b>theories</b> <b>about</b> reality), value <b>theory</b> (<b>theories</b> <b>about</b> morality and ethics), and computer science (<b>theories</b> <b>about</b> programmatic manipulation of data).|$|R

5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times {{to the south and}} south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the rise of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E
5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> {{the origin of}} the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
