25|$|In addition, glacial sediments of the Port Askaig <b>Tillite</b> Formation in Scotland clearly show {{interbedded}} {{cycles of}} glacial and shallow marine sediments. The {{significance of these}} deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|About 290 {{million years}} ago, in the Carboniferous period, an ice age engulfed {{the area as}} glaciers {{advanced}} from the polar region eroding and transporting rocks. These rocks were deposited as extensive moraines and glacial till, or they sank in the sea while the glacier floated in a layer of ice. When the glacial sediments were turned into stone they formed the rocks that now make up the Fitzroy <b>Tillite</b> Formation in the Falklands. Identical rocks are found in southern Africa.|$|E
40|$|The 185 and 328 m cores {{recovered}} from DVDP 10 and 11 respectively in eastern Taylor Valley reflect the Miocene to Pleistocene tectonic and glacial {{history of the}} uplifted former fjord. At both drilling sites a Pleistocene regressive glacio-marine sequence disconformably overlies early Pliocene marine <b>tillites,</b> which in turn at DVDP 11 overlie late Miocene marine <b>tillites.</b> The 139 m of Miocene and Pliocene strata in DVDP 11 indicate both decreasing bathymetry and increasing ice cover in progressively younger horizons. The overlying regressive Pleistocene strata in DVDP 11 exceed 188 m, and in DVDP 10 137 m. The basal disconformity indicates major uplift, with grounding of ice in DVDP 10 and sublittoral reworking in DVDP 11. The Pleistocene marine <b>tillites</b> pass irregularly via younger strandline strata up to glaciofluvial sandstones. Intraformational detritus is abundant {{throughout much of the}} Pleistocene sequence and indicates periods of erosion contemporaneous with sedimentation. Similarly some of the Pliocene and Miocene <b>tillites</b> contain fragments of older <b>tillites.</b> Evidence of resedimentation occurs in DVDP 10. The petrography of the cores shows their derivation to have been largely from the early Palaeozoic basement complex of southern Victoria Land, and to a much less extent from the Jurassic Ferrar Dolerites. There is evidence to suggest the Pleistocene strata were deposited from ice extending eastwards up the valley, in contrast to the Pliocene and Miocene <b>tillites</b> which were derived from a western ice source flowing down the valley. Basaltic volcanic detritus is present throughout, but is abundant only in the youngest horizons...|$|R

2500|$|Long {{before the}} idea of a global {{glaciation}} was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material (<b>tillite)</b> in Islay, Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that {{came to be known as}} [...] "Reusch's Moraine" [...] was reported by Hans Reusch in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of continental drift.|$|E

5000|$|The Permian and Triassic {{deposits}} {{together are}} known as the Parmeener Super Group. The lowest levels are a discontinuous dark grey pebbly <b>tillite</b> up to several hundreds of meters thick. It has been found at Cygnet (Truro <b>Tillite),</b> Glenorchy, Margate, Woodbridge, Maydena, Shoemaker Point and Hastings. Mount Anne, Mount Mueller, and Mount Wedge are the most south west extension of the <b>tillite.</b> [...] In the north it occurs at Wynyard as the Wynyard <b>Tillite.</b> In the west is the Zeehan <b>Tillite.</b> The broken fragments of rocks are often faceted and scratched, and can be up to boulder sized. They are embedded in rock flour and silt. The ice that brought the till flowed from the west of Tasmania in an easterly direction.

2500|$|As of 2007, {{there was}} only one [...] "very reliable" [...] – still {{challenged}} – datum point identifying tropical <b>tillites,</b> which makes statements of equatorial ice cover somewhat presumptuous.

40|$|A Neoproterozoic {{succession}} of glaciomarine deposits of probably Sturtian age is preserved on the Yangtze Platform in South China. At that time, the South China block {{was located in}} intermediate to low paleolatitudes at ca. 40 °. The snowball Earth hypothesis offers {{one possible explanation for}} the occurrence of low latitude <b>tillites.</b> The hypothesis is largely based on geological and geochemical observation made in deposits underlying or overlying such <b>tillites</b> on several continents. In con-trast our study focuses on evidence offered by the <b>tillites</b> themselves. We use major, and trace rare element geochemistry to evaluate the environmental conditions prevailing during the glaciation. Of particular interest are the intensity of chemical weathering and the relative degree of oxygenation of Neoproterozoic (Nanhuan-Sinian) marine bottom waters. CIA values were obtained from preglacial sand- and siltstones, the matrix of the glacial deposits, fine-grained clastic sediments of a unit intercalated in the glacial succession, and postglacial siltstones and black shales. The data indicate relatively low degrees of chemical weathering for the glacial deposits. In contrast, pre-and postglacial deposits display comparatively elevated levels. This is also true for the intercalated unit, which we interpret as the product of a warmer and more humid interglacial period. Data for S/TOC, U/Th, Cd, Mo, and the Ceanom of the glacioma-rine samples indicate the presence of oxic bottom waters during the glaciation. The snowball Earth hypothesis predicts the shutdown of chemical weathering on the con-tinents and complete anoxia of the global ocean largely covered by sea ice for sev-eral million years. The geochemical record of the Neoproterozoic <b>tillites</b> on the Yangtze Platform is difficult to reconcile with the snowball Earth hypothesis. 1...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} {{demonstrates that}} substantial impact crater deposits {{should have been}} produced during the last 2 Gy of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s history. Textures of impact deposits are shown to resemble textures of <b>tillites</b> and diamictites of Precambrian and younger ages. The calculated thickness distribution for impact crater deposits produced during 2 Gy {{is similar to that}} of <b>tillites</b> and diamictites ≤ 2 Ga. We suggest, therefore, that some tillites/diamictites could be of impact origin. Extensive tillite/diamictite deposits predated continental flood basalts on the interior of Gondwa- naland. Significantly, other investigators have already associated impact cratering with flood basalt volcanism and continental rifting. Thus, it is proposed that the breakup of Gondwanaland could have been initiated by crustal fracturing from impacts...|$|R

40|$|Late Palaeozoic {{glaciation}} is {{the longest}} of the Phanerozoic era. It is recorded in numerous Gondwanian basins, some having a high petroleum potential like the Chaco Basin.

Palaeovalleys > 500 m deep and ~ 7 km wide have here been analysed. Focusing on the glaciogenic Carboniferous deposits, the seismic data with well-ties and their outcrop analogues provide new sedimentological insights. The palaeovalley infill is imaged as a chaotic seismic facies overlain by an aggrading-prograding prism, interpreted as <b>tillites</b> covered by a fluvio-deltaic system respectively. <b>Tillites</b> form both under the ice and during rapid ice recession whereas fluvio-deltaic systems can only originate from a stable ice margin and last until the ice sheets withdraw inland. These two depositional modes are repeated several times generating the progressive burial of the Carboniferous palaeovalleys. This succession of erosions and fills records major glacial stages containing a series of glacial and interglacial phases from the Late Devonian to the Early Permian.
