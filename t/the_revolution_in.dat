5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> France (1790) is a {{political}} pamphlet, written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, which attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> France (1790), a defense of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft lived {{together}} happily for brief periods {{before and after}} the birth of Fanny, he left Wollstonecraft in France in the midst of <b>the</b> <b>Revolution.</b> <b>In</b> an attempt to revive their relationship, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia on business for him, taking the one-year-old Fanny with her, but the affair never rekindled. After falling in love with and marrying Godwin, Wollstonecraft died soon after giving birth in 1797, leaving the three-year-old Fanny in the hands of Godwin, along with their newborn daughter Mary.|$|E
5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had {{to do more to}} assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> January 1959.|$|E

5|$|He {{spent the}} early years of <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> Corsica, {{fighting}} in a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists.

5|$|Native-born Puerto Rican (criollos) had {{petitioned the}} Spanish Crown {{to serve in}} the regular Spanish army, {{resulting}} in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico.

However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> Venezuela caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.|$|E

5|$|The University {{closed its}} doors during the Philippine Revolution of 1896 {{because of the}} ensuing disorder.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> November 1918 led in Württemberg, like {{everywhere}} in Germany, {{to the end}} of the monarchy. King William II left Stuttgart on 9November, shortly after a revolutionary crowd had stormed his residence, the Wilhelm Palais and flown a red flag above the building. On the very same day the demonstrators were also able to seize some of Stuttgart's barracks, where parts of the garrisons openly joined them. Rau took active part in the events in Stuttgart's streets on this and the following day.|$|E

5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} dominion leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York. When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to <b>the</b> <b>revolution.</b> <b>In</b> July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> Russia in 1917, the {{communist}} movement gradually gained footholds {{in many countries}} around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Part I of The Age of Reason was {{published}} in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. The Age of Reason belongs to this later, more radical stage of the British political reform movement, one that openly embraced republicanism and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as William Godwin's Political Justice (1793). By {{the middle of the}} decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke's Reflections on <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> France (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Hamilton's early {{participation}} in the American Revolution, his abolitionist sensibilities had become evident. Hamilton was active during <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> <b>in</b> trying to raise black troops for the army, {{with the promise of}} freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical to the values of the American Revolution. In 1785 he joined his close associate John Jay in founding the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been, or May be Liberated, the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end to slavery in the state on July 4, 1827.|$|E
5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Revolutions</b> of 1830 were {{a revolutionary}} wave in Europe {{which took place}} in 1830.

5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>in</b> 1775.|$|E
