5|$|In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed Laelaps trihedrodon Cope 1877 into Megalosaurus trihedrodon. In {{the same}} {{publication}} Nopcsa renamed Poekilopleuron valens Leidy 1870 into Megalosaurus valens; this probably represents fossil material of Allosaurus. In 1902, Nopcsa named Megalosaurus hungaricus {{based on two}} teeth found in Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The specimens, MAFI ob. 3106, were later lost. It represents an indeterminate theropod. In 1903, Louis Dollo named Megalosaurus lonzeensis based on a manual claw found near Lonzee in Belgium. He had first reported this claw in 1883, {{and as a result}} some sources by mistake indicate <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> the date of the naming. It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae, or an indeterminate member of the Coelurosauria. In 1907/1908, von Huene renamed Streptospondylus cuvieri Owen 1842, based on a presently lost partial vertebra, into Megalosaurus cuvieri. This is today seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1909, Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus woodwardi, based on a maxilla with tooth, specimen BMNH 41352. This is today seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace talks}} that begun in 1247 {{achieved}} little, {{but a new}} truce was arranged in September 1248 and peace was made on November 24, 1248. Swantopolk had to return lands seized from his brothers, allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains, stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula, and stop any aid to the Prussians. Prussians were compelled to sign the Treaty of Christburg on February 7, 1249. The treaty provided personal freedom and rights to newly converted Christians. It formally ended the uprising, but already in November 1249 the Natangians defeated the Knights at the Battle of Krücken. The skirmishes lasted until 1253 and some sources cite <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> {{the end of the}} uprising. At that point the treaty ceased its political power but remained an interesting historical document.|$|E
5|$|Year 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was {{a common}} year {{starting}} on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. It was {{a year in the}} 14th century, {{in the midst of a}} period known in European history as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the Black Plague came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} what {{happened}} with both MojmírII and SvatoplukII {{because they are not}} mentioned in written sources after 906. In three battles (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near Bratislava, the Magyars routed Bavarian armies. Some historians put <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).|$|E
25|$|In September, Taylor {{suffered}} {{defeat in}} the European Championship {{for the first time}} in a 10–6 quarter-final loss to Brendan Dolan. He averaged just 89.88 in a defeat which ended his run of four consecutive titles stretching back to the inaugural tournament in 2008. Taylor then lost to Thornton in a major event for the second time <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> he missed six match darts on the way to a three sets to two {{defeat in the}} second round of the World Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Nile Quay Text No.14 (dated to Year 29 of an Usimare Setepenamun) belongs to Osorkon II on palaeographical grounds. This finding suggests that Osorkon II likely did celebrate his first Heb Sed in his 30th Year as was traditionally the case with other Libyan era Pharaohs such as Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In addition, a Year 22 Stela from his reign preserves no mention of any Heb Sed celebrations in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> would be expected (see Von Beckerath, 'infra').|$|E

25|$|Some $246bn {{of private}} equity was {{invested}} globally in 2011, down 6% {{on the previous}} year and around two-thirds below the peak activity in 2006 and 2007. Following on from a strong start, deal activity slowed {{in the second half}} of 2011 due to concerns over the global economy and sovereign debt crisis in Europe. There was $93bn in investments during the first half of <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> the slowdown persisted into 2012. This was down a quarter on the same period in the previous year. Private-equity backed buyouts generated some 6.9% of global M volume in 2011 and 5.9% in the first half of 2012. This was down on 7.4% in 2010 and well below the all-time high of 21% in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Also in England in 1345, Princess Joan was betrothed to Pedro of Castile, son of Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal. She {{would never}} marry him, however, but would die of the Black Plague on her journey to Spain to meet him. Spain, meanwhile, {{continued}} its struggle to regain Muslim territory on the Iberian Peninsula. In {{that same year}} Alfonso XI attacked Gibraltar {{as a part of}} the Reconquista, but was unable to conquer it. In 1345 Muhammud V was made its ruler. The York Minster Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, was completed in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> well. It remains the largest in the region to this day. England was still recovering from French occupation. Until 1345, all school instruction had been in French, rather than English.|$|E
25|$|The Maritime Festivals {{were founded}} by Gerard Richardson MBE and {{organised}} by the Whitehaven Festival Company, {{made up of}} a board of volunteers, who organised 17 major events between 1999 and 2015. The Company was closed in 2016. They organised the Queen's visit to Whitehaven in June 2008, followed by the Status Quo gig in August of that year. The company staged two events in August 2009. The first was the redesigned festival (known for <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> the Whitehaven Food Festival, although it did still feature tall ships) which offered the usual wide variety of attractions, both around the southern half of the harbour and at St. Nicholas' Church, on 8–9 August. The second event, the following week, was the Here and Now Gig (a music concert with 1980s pop icons). For the June 2010 festival, which was similar in format to 2009, the music performances (Status Quo, N-Dubz and Katherine Jenkins) were moved to the harbour area.|$|E

25|$|On May 14, 2008, {{less than}} two weeks {{before the start of the}} 2008 French Open, {{defending}} champion and World No. 1 Justine Henin, announced in a press conference her immediate retirement from the sport. Four-time winner in Roland-Garros, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in 2003, Mary Pierce in 2005, Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2006 and Ana Ivanovic in 2007, Henin became the first player, at 25, to stop her career while holding the number one rank. Despite undergoing a poor run in the 2008 season, Henin was still considered to be a strong favourite for the French Open crown. Her retirement left Serena Williams, the 2002 champion and the tournament favourite <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>as</b> the only former French Open champion remaining in the women's draw, and allowed WTA World No. 2 Maria Sharapova to be installed as the new World No. 1, and become the top seed for the tournament. Henin's last match was against Dinara Safina, who went on to have a successful French Open, reaching the final, where she was beaten by Ana Ivanovic. Henin returned at the end of the women's tournament, and presented new champion Ana Ivanovic with the trophy.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1967, it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle, because the city planned to sell Christmas cards {{depicting}} the structure and hoped Easton would become known as [...] "the Peace Candle city". On October 18, the city's businesses issued a statement, [...] "Whether you choose {{to call it a}} Christmas Candle or a Peace Candle is not important. The important aspect is that the Candle is our clarion call, and this call will be issued <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> a reaffirmation of our desire for peace and harmony in all facts of our lives and throughout the world." [...] On November 27, 1967, about 1,500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting, which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle, which would be rebuilt in subsequent years. The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony, and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves. Also in 1967, a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader, a national children's newspaper circulated in the nation's schools. A columnist for the magazine named [...] "Aunt Em" [...] said it was featured because, [...] "I think the candle in Easton is especially lovely since it is a symbol for both Hanukkah and Christmas". Appeared on December 6, 1967.|$|E
