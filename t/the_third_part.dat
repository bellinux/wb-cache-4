5|$|The station {{building}} in Winschoten {{was completed in}} 1865. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of Staatslijn B between Groningen and Winschoten was opened on 1 May 1868. Trains were initially operated by the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (Company for the Exploitation of the State Railways). Services between Winschoten and Nieuweschans started in November 1868, and between Nieuweschans and Leer in Germany in December 1876, when the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway {{was connected to the}} Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway.|$|E
5|$|While {{composing}} {{the opera}} Siegfried, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of the Ring cycle, Wagner interrupted {{work on it}} and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story Tristan und Isolde and his only mature comedy Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), two works that {{are also part of}} the regular operatic canon.|$|E
5|$|Although loaned {{to friends}} and family, and {{therefore}} in slight public circulation, Coke's Reports were never formally used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing {{the most famous of}} his decisions and pleadings, while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>part,</b> published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E

5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles {{as he had done}} for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part,</b> ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E

40|$|The patient’s {{appearance}} can be dramatically enhanced as {{a result}} of orthognathic surgery. However, esthetic contouring of the mandibular body portion is often overlooked in the surgery. Restoring a more beautiful jaw line is important and directly affects surgical results. From December 2010 to February 2012, we performed mandibular body contouring for the slimming of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> lower <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> face in 37 patients who had undergone either 1 -jaw surgery or 2 -jaw surgery. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> lower <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> facial contour was improved in all the patients after at least 3 months follow-up. Mandibular body contouring is a simple method that can be additionally used for the slimming of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> lower <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> face in patients who require orthognathic surgeries.

The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode {{prior to its}} airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement {{and its potential}} for the greater democratization of society. This {{is followed by the}} text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of the book comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.|$|E

5|$|Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki {{expressed}} interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Part</b> I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined Telecom Animation Film in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1984, {{as well as the}} television series Sherlock Hound.|$|E

The episode features some of the well known characters from Stargate SG-1, a previous series in the Stargate franchise. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> are filmed on location in White Sands, New Mexico, which doubles as a desert planet.

5|$|Market Forces was {{science fiction}} author Richard K. Morgan's third novel. His first two novels, Altered Carbon (2002) and Broken Angels (2003), {{were the first}} two parts of a trilogy later {{completed}} with Woken Furies (2005). That Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, hardboiled detective fiction set in the 25th century, gave Morgan a reputation for writing excellent action sequences along with a Philip K. Dick Award. Before <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of the trilogy was published, Morgan worked on his idea for Market Forces, which he conceived of as a short story, then developed as a film script, then as a novel. At the time, Morgan was 38 years old living in Glasgow, Scotland. He has sold the filming rights to Altered Carbon to Warner Bros. (he would also sell the rights to Market Forces to Warner Bros.) allowing him to leave his job as an English teacher at the University of Strathclyde to focus on his writing career.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, and {{was hired}} at A-Pro, where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 23 episodes of Lupin <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Part</b> I. The two also began {{pre-production}} {{on a series}} based on Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books, designing extensive storyboards; the series was canceled after Miyazaki and Takahata met Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project. In 1972 and 1973, Miyazaki wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda! shorts, directed by Takahata. After moving to from A-Pro to Zuiyō Eizō in June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata worked on World Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animation series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's Heidi. Zuiyō Eizō continued as Nippon Animation in July 1975. Miyazaki also directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978), an adaptation of Alexander Key's The Incredible Tide.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz {{departed}} Rome, {{traveling to}} Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via Dresden and Leipzig arriving about 13 August in Poznań (German name: Posen), then {{part of the}} Kingdom of Prussia. It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian Carbonari to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce. Ultimately he never crossed into Russian Poland, where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in German Poland (historically known to Poles as Wielkopolska, or Greater Poland), where he was well received {{by members of the}} local Polish nobility. He had a brief liaison with Konstancja Łubieńska at her family estate. Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in Dresden, in Saxony, where he wrote <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of his poem Dziady.|$|E
