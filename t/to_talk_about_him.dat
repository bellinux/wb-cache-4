25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
2500|$|Sitting Bull was Flying Hawk’s uncle, Flying Hawk’s {{mother and}} Sitting Bull’s wife being sisters. [...] He knew him well and wished <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Flying Hawk {{observed}} that Sitting Bull {{was the key}} strategist before and again after the fight was over. The fighting was led by Crazy Horse, his young War Chief, and Sitting Bull {{was not in the}} Custer fight. [...] "He was a strong speaker just like any white senator. [...] He was a good politician. [...] White politicians are only ‘medicine men’ for their people are most time crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{struggled}} against New Zealand in 1980–81, making only 102 runs {{at an average}} of 27.25 in three Tests. Rumours about Hughes' selection prospects again began to circulate. While Hughes was batting in the traditional Australia Day Test in Adelaide, this time against India, later that summer, his nemesis Ian Chappell opined on the airwaves that [...] "Hughes really does need to build up a big score here. People are starting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> being dropped." [...] In seeming response to this criticism, Hughes scored a double-century; 213 runs including 21 boundaries. A [...] "magnificent innings" [...] Wisden declared, adding that Hughes' batting [...] "touched the heights" [...] and that [...] "ith brilliant footwork, he scored freely off the spinners." [...] Hughes dedicated his innings to his newborn twin sons, Sean and Simon.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Oh, I don't think I {{would care}} {{to catch a}} {{sensible}} man. I shouldn't know what <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|REDPENNY. Serve you right! It {{was like}} your cheek <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> science. [He {{returns to his}} table and resumes his writing].|$|R
60|$|Ralph never had, {{and as a}} man now came up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> hay, the dog and {{everything}} connected with it passed out of his mind.|$|R
2500|$|He was {{virtually}} {{retired from the}} entertainment world and was treated like he never existed. From here on, the media would refer {{to him as the}} [...] "former entertainer", and all the recordings and pictures taken when he was a Chanels/Rats & Star member were almost never broadcast anymore, and if they were, Tashiro's voice would be lowered to a hush or removed entirely, and no part of his body would show. Newspapers and magazines tacitly agreed not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> at all. In an episode of a comedic duo , host Hikari Ota accidentally said his full name. In , Sayaka Aoki, while displaying only part of his name, said [...] "I put a camera in the chest drawer", which caused a general laugh. On the other hand, the part of Ken Shimura's commemorative speech held for the release of his program on DVD where he said [...] "Have you disappeared like Takafumi Horie when you were knocked-out? I wanted to release this five years ago" [...] was not broadcast.|$|E
2500|$|Waldock {{was educated}} at Uppingham School and from 1918 was at Hertford College, Oxford. As a cricketer, {{he was a}} left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the MCC at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first-innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that [...] "Waldock did so well... that people began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as the coming left-hand bat".|$|E
2500|$|From that {{statement}} of March 1834, {{it does not}} appear that animosity still existed on the composer's part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: [...] "Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man" [...] and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he, Bellini, says [...] "whereas I do nothing but <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> to the entire universe". Then he ends with: [...] "Give him a kiss for me". This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states [...] "I have not ceased to love him , for I recognise that the blame is not all his".|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Ruth Stevenson's folks some time," [...] said Jack; [...] "but I'm afraid I'm {{going to}} have a hard time getting at it." ...|$|R
60|$|All this I {{knew to be}} very true. Had it {{not been}} for this {{peculiarity}} of Mr. Hinckman I might have been more willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his niece.|$|R
6000|$|Stephen, {{leaning back}} and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened <b>to</b> the <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> which Heron checked {{from time to}} time by saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Dombey--you and I used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> sometimes, you know,' said Rob to Mrs Brown. 'You {{used to get}} me to {{talk about}} him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} are not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> either! Unfortunate young man! I wonder whether he feels himself how {{thoroughly}} he is destroying the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't {{think about}} him any more,' I interrupted, perceiving his strongly- {{suppressed}} emotion. 'You didn't come here <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> I'm sure. Let us dismiss him.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{she wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Italy,--only {{she did not}} know how to begin,--when a {{customer}} appeared, an Italian woman who conversed with him in soft, liquid tones that moved her....|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Baring is an {{intelligent}} man," [...] she said, [...] "and he is a man, too, who understands his own particular subject. Of {{course it is}} a pleasure <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|Johnny {{bent his}} head, {{and the young}} physician, {{somewhat}} surprised at finding himself saying so much on such points, left that branch of the subject, and began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his uncle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, Lancey, I know; but I haven't time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> just now. We {{are going}} to the bit of waste ground in the hollow; follow us there." ...|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. I {{see nothing}} new about him, except your way of {{chaffing}} him. But I don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> just now. I {{want to speak to}} you about Ann.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! Well, {{there is}} another Englishman staying at the Lion d'Or. He {{appears to be a}} decent fellow, and a gentleman. I am not going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I imagine that he is harmless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is dissatisfied," [...] thought I, [...] "and is {{ashamed to}} show it, afraid doubtless of hurting my feelings. What had I <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> any thing save {{charters}} and sasines?--Stay, {{he is going}} to begin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I loved doing it!" [...] she replied, and paused, flushing. She {{might have}} known {{that it would be}} simply {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it! So she laid it down on the workbench, and, overcome by a sudden shyness, retreated toward the door.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transition}} {{scene from}} Peter's house to Quagmire's house when Peter decides <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> a revenge lay is {{a parody of}} the transition scenes from the original Transformers cartoon series, with the Autobot and Decepticon symbols being replaced with Peter and Quagmire's faces.|$|R
60|$|Poinsinet {{remained}} then silent, {{and listened}} to his neighbors, who agreed, at last, {{that he was a}} quiet, orderly personage, and had left the table early, being unwilling to drink too much. Presently they ceased <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and resumed their conversation upon other matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say--I say again--that it doesn't become you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Why {{he should}} be {{mentioned}} passes me quite!" [...] she exclaimed desperately. [...] "I know this, th-th-that he is a thoroughly conscientious man--blunt sometimes even to rudeness--but always speaking his mind about you plain to your face!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In those days, Bob was a besotted whisky-tank; {{but we are}} {{not going}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I'm afraid I was forgetful and went my own way like an obstinate fool. It was wrong, ridiculously wrong; I'm not going to excuse myself, but I want you to understand." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "The Limey", Beckett and Lanie <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Castle, leading Beckett {{to admit}} her {{feelings}} for him. Her attempt to tell <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this (encouraged by Lanie) fails, though, as he appears with {{a flight attendant}} at the crime scene. Beckett is disappointed, but still refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it was nonsense,--on such an occasion. If a man asks a girl {{to marry}} him, he doesn't want her <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> being his sister. I think it is nonsense. If she would only {{consider}} about it properly she would soon learn to love him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not sure; {{he gives}} me all I want; I know that much. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it when I go home. Anyhow, I shall set him a good example;" [...] and Tommy was so serious, that Nat did not dare to laugh, but said, respectfully, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. That's the man I mean," [...] {{he said in}} a contemptuous tone. [...] "I don't {{particularly}} like the name and I am sure I don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> more than I can help. If he hadn't been your husband I wouldn't have put up with his manners for an hour. Do you know what would have happened to him if he hadn't been your husband?" ...|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA. Yes, {{you would}} {{think he was a}} great deal better. But the {{microbes}} are at work, slowly but surely. In another year it will be all over. Poor old Dad! it's unfeeling <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> in this attitude: I must sit down properly. (She comes down from the settee and takes the chair near the bookstand.) I should like papa to live for ever just to take the conceit out of Paramore. I believe he's in love with Julia.|$|E
60|$|But Emmeline was a {{match for}} us all. She never let Prissy out of her sight. Everywhere she went she toted Prissy, too. When a month had gone by, I was almost in despair. Mr. Leonard had {{to leave for the}} Assembly in another week and Stephen's {{neighbours}} were beginning <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> They said that a man who spent all his time hanging around the yard with a spyglass, and trusting everything to a hired boy, couldn't be altogether right in his mind.|$|E
5000|$|Virgil doesn't help matters when {{he tells}} Rick that he [...] "Should've kept the secret to himself". Virgil and Rick's friend Frieda calls Virgil <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his {{homophobia}} {{and to try to}} help him understand. Eventually Frieda, her friend Daisy Watkins, and Rick go to a gay rights convention together.|$|R
5000|$|Moss No. What do you mean? Have I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this Pause ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} quiet, {{as if it}} were {{something}} not <b>to</b> be <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> by <b>him.</b> He seemed sad.|$|R
