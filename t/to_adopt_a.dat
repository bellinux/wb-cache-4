5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> low-cost aircraft {{to supplement the}} F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk in 1940, the British Armed Forces wanted <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> submachine gun similar to the MP 40. The Royal Air Force sent a request to the Ministry of Supply for 10,000 British-made copies of the MP 40, but eventually they settled on {{a copy of the}} MP 28, known as the Lanchester.|$|E
50|$|Like innovations, adopters {{have been}} {{determined}} to have traits that affect their likelihood <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> innovation. A bevy of individual personality traits have been explored for their impacts on adoption, but with little agreement. Ability and motivation, which vary on situation unlike personality traits, have a large impact on a potential adopter's likelihood <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> innovation. Unsurprisingly, potential adopters who are motivated <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> innovation are likely to make the adjustments needed <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> it. Motivation can be impacted by the meaning that an innovation holds; innovations can have symbolic value that encourage (or discourage) adoption. First proposed by Ryan and Gross (1943), the overall connectedness of a potential adopter to the broad community represented by a city. Potential adopters who frequent metropolitan areas are more likely <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> innovation. Finally, potential adopters who have the power or agency to create change, particularly in organizations, are more likely <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> innovation than someone with less power over his choices.|$|R
