5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. <b>The</b> <b>committee,</b> soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> for inquiry and report back to the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> may have made.|$|E
5|$|Despite its aims, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
50|$|BHS has {{a number}} of {{committees}} meant to consolidate work efforts and involve participants.

5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> without resistance. <b>The</b> <b>Committee</b> had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, it became clear that <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> would {{no longer be able to}} resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E

5|$|In May 1937, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> noted two {{attacks on}} the patrol's ships in the Balearic islands by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft, the first on the Italian cruiser Barletta and the second on German pocket {{battleship}} Deutschland. It iterated calls for the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain, condemned the bombing of open towns, and showed approval of humanitarian work. Germany and Italy said they would withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>Committee,</b> and from the patrols, unless it could be guaranteed {{there would be no}} further attacks. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> and patrols. Italian reticence of operations in Spain, however, was dropped. By contrast, it continued to be a crime in Germany to mention German operations. Following attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany, but denied) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols, but not from <b>the</b> <b>Committee.</b> This prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the SpainPortugal border.|$|E
