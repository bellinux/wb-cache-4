5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside <b>triphosphates,</b> predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside <b>triphosphates.</b> The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E

50|$|Deoxycytidine <b>triphosphate</b> (dCTP) is a {{nucleoside}} <b>triphosphate</b> {{that contains}} the pyrimidine base cytosine. The <b>triphosphate</b> group contains high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, which liberate energy when hydrolized.|$|R
25|$|DNA {{replication}} at the {{replication fork}} can be halted by {{a shortage of}} deoxynucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> (dNTPs) or by DNA damage, resulting in replication stress. This halting of replication {{is described as a}} stalled replication fork. A fork protection complex of proteins stabilizes the replication fork until DNA damage or other replication problems can be fixed. Prolonged replication fork stalling can lead to further DNA damage. Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the replication fork are resolved.|$|E
25|$|SulA/FtsZ {{mediated}} filamentation: This is {{a mechanism}} to halt cell division and repair DNA. In the presence of single-stranded DNA regions, due to the action of different external cues (that induce mutations), the major bacterial recombinase (RecA) binds to this DNA regions and is activated {{by the presence of}} free nucleotide <b>triphosphates.</b> This activated RecA stimulates the autoproteolysis of the SOS transcriptional repressor LexA. The LexA regulon includes a cell division inhibitor, SulA, that prevent the transmission of mutant DNA to the daughter cells. SulA is a dimer that binds FtsZ (a tubulin-like GTPase) in a 1:1 ratio and acts specifically on its polymerization which results in the formation of non-septated bacteria filaments. A similar mechanism may occur in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,which also elongates after being phagocytized.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic <b>triphosphates</b> that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
50|$|CMP can be {{phosphorylated}} to cytidine diphosphate by {{the enzyme}} CMP kinase, with adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> or guanosine <b>triphosphate</b> donating the phosphate group. Since cytidine <b>triphosphate</b> {{is generated by}} amination of uridine <b>triphosphate,</b> {{the main source of}} CMP is from RNA being decomposed by RNAse.|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of ribavirin to its mono-, di-, and <b>triphosphate</b> derivatives {{was examined}} in uninfected and respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells. The degree of phosphorylation was dose dependent upon extracellular ribavirin concentration. The major species formed was the <b>triphosphate,</b> with mono- and diphosphates being approximately 12 and 4 % of the <b>triphosphate,</b> respectively. Amounts of <b>triphosphate</b> formed in infected cells {{were up to}} 2. 6 -fold greater than those in uninfected cells. Upon drug removal, ribavirin <b>triphosphate</b> degradation was very rapid, with decay half-lives of 70 to 100 min. Actinomycin D inhibited <b>triphosphate</b> production and also neutralized the antiviral effect of ribavirin...|$|R
25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} hydrolyzes inosine <b>triphosphate</b> and deoxyinosine <b>triphosphate</b> to the monophosphate {{nucleotide}} and diphosphate. The enzyme possesses a multiple substrate-specificity and acts on other nucleotides including xanthosine <b>triphosphate</b> and deoxyxanthosine <b>triphosphate.</b> The encoded protein, {{which is a}} member of the HAM1 NTPase protein family, is found in the cytoplasm and acts as a homodimer.|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{convenient}} method for nucleoside <b>triphosphate</b> synthesis {{was applied to}} the preparation of potentially nonhydrolyzable xanthosine <b>triphosphate</b> derivatives. The N-methylimidazolide of xanthosine 52 ̆ 7 -monophosphate reacted rapidly with methylenediphosphonic acid and imidodiphosphonic acid to give xanthosine 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-methylene) <b>triphosphate</b> and xanthosine 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-imido) <b>triphosphate,</b> respectively, in good yields. Both compounds inhibited the xanthosine-diphosphate-dependent prenylation of a mutant of Rab 5, Rab 5 D 136 N, the nucleotide specificity of which had been converted from GTP to xanthosine <b>triphosphate.</b> The results indicate that xanthosine 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-methylene) <b>triphosphate</b> and xanthosine 52 ̆ 7 -(beta, gamma-imido) <b>triphosphate</b> bound to the mutant protein with similar affinities and were not hydrolyzed under the assay conditions. These novel derivatives may be useful tools {{for the study of the}} role of individual GTPases mutated to xanthosine <b>triphosphate</b> specificity in the background of other GTP-binding proteins...|$|R
2500|$|Fluorescein {{can also}} be {{conjugated}} to nucleoside <b>triphosphates</b> and incorporated into a probe enzymatically for in situ hybridisation. The use of fluorescein amidite shown above allows one to synthesize labeled oligonucleotides for the same purpose. Yet another technique termed molecular beacons makes use of synthetic fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. [...] Fluorescein-labelled probes can be imaged using FISH, or targeted by antibodies using immunohistochemistry. [...] The latter is a common alternative to digoxigenin, and the two are used together for labelling two genes in one sample.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{polymerase}} adds a new {{strand of}} DNA by extending the 3' {{end of an}} existing nucleotide chain, adding new nucleotides matched to the template strand {{one at a time}} via the creation of phosphodiester bonds. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated base. [...] Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called nucleotides; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called nucleoside <b>triphosphates.</b> When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a pyrophosphate. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replisome}} {{is responsible}} for copying the entire genomic DNA in each proliferative cell. The base pairing and chain formation reactions, which form the daughter helix, are catalyzed by DNA polymerases. These enzymes move along single-stranded DNA and allow for {{the extension of the}} nascent DNA strand by [...] "reading" [...] the template strand and allowing for incorporation of the proper purine nucleobases, adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine nucleobases, thymine and cytosine. Activated free deoxyribonucleotides exist in the cell as deoxyribonucleotide <b>triphosphates</b> (dNTPs). These free nucleotides are added to an exposed 3'-hydroxyl group on the last incorporated nucleotide. In this reaction, a pyrophosphate is released from the free dNTP, generating energy for the polymerization reaction and exposing the 5' monophosphate, which is then covalently bonded to the 3' oxygen. Additionally, incorrectly inserted nucleotides can be removed and replaced by the correct nucleotides in an energetically favorable reaction. This property is vital to proper proofreading and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleoside}} <b>triphosphate</b> (NTP) {{involved in}} the reaction varies from species to species. Phosphopantothenate—cysteine ligase from the bacterium Escherichia coli uses cytidine <b>triphosphate</b> (CTP) as an energy donor, whilst the human isoform uses adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP).|$|R
50|$|Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 7,8-Dihydroneopterin <b>triphosphate,</b> and two products, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin and <b>triphosphate.</b>|$|R
40|$|PurposeAdenosine <b>triphosphate</b> {{released}} from urothelium during stretch stimulates afferent nerves and conveys information on bladder fullness. We measured adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> released during cystometric bladder filling {{in women with}} idiopathic detrusor overactivity and stress incontinence (controls), and assessed whether the level of released adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> is related to cystometric parameters. Materials and MethodsRoutine cystometry was done in 51 controls and 48 women with detrusor overactivity who were 28 to 87 years old. Voided urodynamic fluid was collected and stored at ÃÂ¿ 30 C. Adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> was measured by a bioluminescence assay. ResultsAdenosine <b>triphosphate</b> levels were similar in voided urodynamic fluid of controls and patients with detrusor overactivity (p = 0. 79). A significant inverse correlation was seen between adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> and maximal cystometric capacity in controls (p = 0. 013), and between voided volume and adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> in controls (p = 0. 015) and detrusor overactivity cases (p = 0. 019). A significant correlation between first desire to void and adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> was also noted in detrusor overactivity cases (p = 0. 033) but not in controls (p = 0. 58). No correlation was seen between adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> and detrusor pressure during filling or voiding. ConclusionsAdenosine <b>triphosphate</b> measurement in voided urodynamic fluid is a novel approach to understanding signals that {{may contribute to the}} urgency sensation (a sudden compelling desire to pass urine). The inverse correlation between adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> in voided urodynamic fluid and first desire to void suggests that adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> has a role in modulating the early filling sensation in patients with detrusor overactivity...|$|R
