5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> A recording of Larkin reading <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> is the same as in the printed volume.|$|E
5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, writes that <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis}} on aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace Stevens' {{essential}} modernist poem, [...] "Of Modern Poetry"(1942) {{sounds as}} if the verbs are left out. The verb 'to be' is omitted from the first and final lines. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> itself opens and closes with the act of finding. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> and <b>the</b> mind become synonymous: a collapse between <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> <b>the</b> act, and the mind. During <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>the</b> dyad becomes further collapsed into one: a spatial and a temporal collapse between the subject and the object; form and content equal each other; form becomes not simply expressive of, but constitutive of. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> goes from being a static object to being an action. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> of <b>the</b> mind has to be alternative and listening; it is experimental. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> resists and refuses transcendentalism, but remains within the conceptual limits {{of the mind and}} <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic part}} of the Ptochoprodromic {{writings}} consists of five laments and begging poems, which are marked as ABCDE. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> A laments over the poet's garrulous wife and calls for help from emperor John II Komnenos (r. 1118-1143). <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> B is addressed to a sebastokrator and begs for charity to improve <b>the</b> menu. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> C, addressed to emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143-1180), relates a young monk's complaint over scandalous living circumstances in his monastery. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> D is only a parallel of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> C. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> E describes a Byzantine writer.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> uses an {{irregular}} {{form of the}} Pindaric ode in 11 stanzas. The lengths of the lines and of the stanzas vary throughout the text, and <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> begins with an iambic meter. The irregularities increase throughout <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and Stanza IX lacks a regular form before being replaced with a march-like meter {{in the final two}} stanzas. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> also contains multiple enjambments and there is a use of an ABAB rhyme scheme that gives <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> a singsong quality. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> <b>the</b> rhymes start to become as irregular in a similar way to the meter, and the irregular Stanza IX closes with an iambic couplet. The purpose of the change in rhythm, rhyme, and style is to match the emotions expressed in <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> as it develops from idea to idea. The narration of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is in <b>the</b> style of an interior monologue, and there are many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> that connects it to Coleridge's style of poetry called [...] "Conversation poems", especially <b>the</b> <b>poem's</b> reliance on a one sided discussion that expects a response that never comes. There is also a more traditional original of the discussion style of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> as many of the prophetic aspects of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> are related to the Old Testament of the Bible. Additionally, the reflective and questioning aspects are similar to the Psalms and the works of Saint Augustine, and the ode contains what is reminiscent of Hebrew prayer.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{analyses}} <b>the</b> fifteenth-century Scottish <b>poem</b> <b>The</b> Kingis Quair, {{exploring its}} avowed sources and the acknowledgement of literary tradition {{that takes place}} {{towards the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> By setting <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> in <b>the</b> context of the manuscript anthology in which it appears, the article explores the relation of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> with <b>the</b> concept of authority, focussing on the envoy of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and its explicit appeal to great English poets of the past...|$|R
25|$|The Preface to <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> {{was not supposed}} to be printed, that it was a fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with the first half of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is from <b>the</b> view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> to show how a reader is to interpret the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is a vocal individual, but both are poets who lose inspiration. Only the poet of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, The Picture, states that visions are unrecoverable.|$|R

5|$|A {{week later}} Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in {{connection}} with <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> {{could not have been}} produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet Herybert Menzel. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{at least}} some of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style.

5000|$|The {{editors of}} Exploring Poetry {{believe that the}} meaning of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and its form are intimately bound together. They state that [...] "since <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is {{composed}} of one sentence broken up at various intervals, it is truthful to say that 'so much depends upon' each line of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> This is so because the form of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is also its meaning." [...] This viewpoint is also argued by Henry M. Sayre who compared <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> to <b>the</b> readymade artwork of Marcel Duchamp.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E

5000|$|Due to its title, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is {{generally}} considered an incomplete piece of work. However, some literary critics believe that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is, in fact, complete due to the overall symbolism within <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Scholars argued that the fragment is a symbol for the eagle due to the eagle [...] "breaking away" [...] from the mountain. They say that the fragment is vital to understanding <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> in <b>the</b> way that the mountain depicted is in fact <b>the</b> whole <b>poem</b> and <b>the</b> eagle, {{being a part of}} the mountains identity, is a loss when the eagle falls. The uncertainty of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> being complete or incomplete reinforces the open ended question of what happens to the eagle at the end of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 1963 Ria Schulte {{published}} an article in Standpunte with the title "Die sindelinghaan". In this article she analysed a poem which appears in a prose text "Gerwe-ry en trap" by Boerneef. While Schutte's analysis opens up various perspectives on <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and suggests {{a number of ways}} in which <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> could be interpreted, she ignores the transtextual links between <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and <b>the</b> prose text in which it is embedded. This article is the report o f a re-reading of <b>the</b> same <b>poem.</b> <b>The</b> re-reading suggests that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> indeed has an important transtextual function in the text, that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> as sign system becomes duplicitous in its transtextual relationship(s) with the text at large and concludes that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> functions as an integrated component of the narrative structure as a whole...|$|R
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content.

5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5000|$|Paradox, however, is {{essential}} to the structure and being of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> In <b>The</b> Well Wrought Urn Brooks shows that paradox was so essential to poetic meaning that paradox was almost identical to poetry. According to literary theorist Leroy Searle, Brooks' use of paradox emphasized the indeterminate lines between form and content. [...] "The form of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> uniquely embodies its meaning" [...] and the language of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> [...] "affects <b>the</b> reconciliation of opposites or contraries". While irony functions within <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> paradox often refers to the meaning and structure of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and is thus inclusive of irony. This existence of opposites or contraries and the reconciliation thereof is poetry and the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|R
