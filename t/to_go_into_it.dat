500|$|Troutman, {{seeing the}} disarray that was {{surrounding}} Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of {{more money for}} the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton's departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's later work. In Clinton's biography George Clinton: For the Record, Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude, [...] "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money". In response, Clinton remarked, [...] "CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don't like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , {{and a lot of}} people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling". [...] The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton's and Funkadelic's musical careers. [...] The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in August 1981 on Warner Bros.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan for the song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. In an interview for MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go in. Go for the kill. I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into...</b> <b>It</b> was just like me telling her, you sure you wanna go here with me? I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|E

60|$|A {{quick change}} came over her. She mistrusted herself, she mistrusted the outer world. She {{did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, {{she did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> she wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> no further.|$|R

6000|$|Well, he had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> now. [...] "I don't {{think you}} can have it," [...] he said, and then as she {{remained}} silent, [...] "Marjorie, {{do you know how}} much money I've got?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{that would}} be {{perfectly}} glorious!" [...] cried Margaret, springing to her feet, an immense relief coming to her mind {{with the thought that}} to examine this actual shaft it would not be necessary for anybody <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>into</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5000|$|She {{created a}} series of artworks {{concerning}} erections, in defense of which she said, “If the erect penis is not wholesome enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> museums, <b>it</b> {{should not be considered}} wholesome enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> women.” [...] She also created a series in 1963 which she called [...] "mom art", in reaction to pop art.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{she lowered}} her voice, [...] "it does a little {{reconcile}} me that I don't think we ought <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further <b>into</b> <b>it</b> till we can understand. I did make that dreadful vow. I know I ought not now; but still I did, in so many words." ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, {{this fine}} castle of the ogre's, had a mind <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Puss, who heard {{the noise of}} his Majesty's coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the King: ...|$|E
60|$|I worked {{excessive}} hard {{these three}} or four months to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> not by a door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.|$|E

[...] "She keeps {{asking questions about}} why we are having the election {{and what it is}} all about, and why Harry is a candidate and all that.

5000|$|Bourgeois aligned {{herself with}} activists {{and became a}} member of the Fight Censorship Group, a feminist anti-censorship {{collective}} founded by fellow artist Anita Steckel. In the 1970s, the group defended the use of sexual imagery in artwork. Steckel argued, “If the erect penis is not wholesome enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> museums, <b>it</b> should not be considered wholesome enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> women.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Then, on {{the cusp}} of {{achieving}} so much, there was a downturn in the market. [...] "The compulsory move of the plant in 1891 caused a substantial strain on the company's capital and credit. The financial panic of 1892 caused the Company <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> receivership. <b>It</b> was taken over by the Bertram interests." ...|$|R

"Yes," [...] I {{remarked to}} him, {{in the course}} of a {{conversation}} about the late Mother Superior, [...] "what she is going to do is a very fine thing,--a noble enterprise, and she is just the sort of person <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> but after all I would rather see her married to the right sort of man. A woman like that owes it to society to be married." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} I walked forth to Charing Cross, and thence along the Strand and Fleet Street, where I made no new discoveries, unless {{it were the}} Mitre Tavern. I mean <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> some day. The streets were much thronged, and {{there seemed to be}} a good many young people,--lovers, it is to be hoped,--who had spent the day together, and were going innocently home.

60|$|It {{was about}} the latter end of June when the ears of this corn ripened, which I laid up very {{carefully}} together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap the fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired before I could allow myself to eat any barley-bread, and much longer time before I had any rice.

60|$|Dapplegrim {{told him}} what he was to do the second time, and he turned himself into a lump of earth, and stuck himself between the hoof and the shoe on Dapplegrim's left fore foot.

So this time he allowed her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and she peered about high and low, but she could not look under his hoofs, for he stood much too firmly on his legs for that, and she could not find the youth.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Van de Werff was {{answering}} in {{his slow}} voice.

At this point, as he had not the slightest intention of parting with his valuable charger, at any rate on such terms, Montalvo changed the subject.|$|E
