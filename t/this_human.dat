5|$|Tobe Hooper, then {{preparing}} both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood {{the concept}} of the character ("They thought it was like The Wolf Man", said director Joseph Zito) and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. <b>This</b> <b>human</b> tarantula refuses to join the scientist’s new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of <b>this</b> <b>human</b> misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before <b>this</b> <b>human</b> incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E

25|$|In May 2009, {{during the}} H1N1 outbreak, {{while working as}} scout for Pachuca, Meza was {{detained}} incommunicado in Ghana for over 27 hours under terrible hygienic conditions since he flew in from Mexico. His father, Enrique Meza, strongly protested <b>this</b> <b>human</b> rights violation and inhumane treatment of his son in a letter for the Government of Ghana through the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations. Meza Jr. was later sent to Nigeria from where he left for Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Ponce's {{economic}} strength {{was also the}} result of the city becoming the home base of a very influential immigration. Events like the Haitian Revolution (1789–1804), the Latin American Wars of Independence (1810–1824), and the Spanish government immigrants policies (like the 1815 Real Cedula de Gracia) promoted the arrival of numerous well-to-do foreign citizens that made out of Ponce's fertile flatlands their new production centers (specially sugarcane) and turned Ponce's urban center into their new homes. Don Salvador de Vives, founder of the Vives dynasty in the island and the well-known Hacienda Buena Vista, arrived in Ponce in 1821, from Venezuela, with his wife, his little son, Carlos Vives, future owner of Casa Vives, and two slaves, as part of <b>this</b> <b>human</b> exodus.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} The Plagues of Egypt: Archaeology, History, and Science Look at the Bible, Siro Igino Trevisanato explores {{the theory that}} the plagues were {{initially}} caused by the Santorini eruption in Greece. His hypothesis considers a two-stage eruption over a time of a bit less than two years. His studies place the first eruption in 1602 BC, when volcanic ash taints the Nile, causing the first plague and forming a catalyst for many of the subsequent plagues. In 1600 BC, the plume of a Santorini eruption caused the ninth plague, the days of darkness. Trevisanato hypothesizes that the Egyptians (at that time under the occupation of Hyksos), resorted to human sacrifice in an attempt to appease the gods, for they had viewed the ninth plague as a precursor to more. <b>This</b> <b>human</b> sacrifice became known as the tenth plague.|$|E

25|$|Still he {{maintained}} that virtue alone is valuable in itself, {{and that the}} value of every thing else is conditional. According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue, though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, that {{it is only in the}} enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong. In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without which external good things cannot be attained, and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people, and therefore seems to have regarded <b>this</b> <b>human</b> wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, defining, and applying. How decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, that it comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one's feet upon the property of others. His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of children should be guarded against the poison of immoral speeches.|$|E
500|$|The {{abilities}} of Ali fascinated {{the public and}} medical authorities. As reported in a 1928 Sheboygan Press article, at one of Ali's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance. They came away satisfied {{that he was actually}} imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed, but remained [...] "mystified over his extraordinary performance." [...] According to an article appearing in the Naugatuck Daily News, [...] "Physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of <b>this</b> <b>human</b> ostrich without success.

[...] Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to <b>this</b> <b>human</b> view {{in the midst of the}} poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain [...] "shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way." ...|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{creating}} Leonardo {{was to make}} a social robot. Its motors, sensors, and cameras allow it to mimic human expression, interact with limited objects, and track objects. <b>This</b> helps <b>humans</b> react to the robot in a more familiar way. Through <b>this</b> reaction, <b>humans</b> can engage the robot in more naturally social ways. Leonardo’s programming blends with psychological theory so that he learns more naturally, interacts more naturally, and collaborates more naturally with humans.|$|R
50|$|When an animal's eye is in motion, {{the image}} will suffer from motion blur, {{resulting}} in an inability to resolve details. To cope with <b>this,</b> <b>humans</b> generally alternate between saccades (quick eye movements) and fixation (focusing on a single point). Saccadic masking makes motion blur during a saccade invisible. Similarly, smooth pursuit allows the eye to track a target in rapid motion, eliminating motion blur of that target instead of the scene.|$|R

500|$|For {{the role}} of Reese, various other {{suggestions}} were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his [...] "feelings about the project changed". Hurd stated that [...] "almost everyone else who {{came in from the}} audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be <b>this</b> <b>human</b> connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off."

This physical contact between the Creator and Eve is repeated even more noticeably in the way Adam's toes touch the Lord's foot. Here is the stressing of a rapport: Adam seems indeed to be stretching to his full length {{in order to make}} contact with the Creator. And the billowing out of the cloak around the Creator's heart, from where the garment falls in marked folds and contours to Adam's feet, also seems to indicate that here a current of divine power flows down, so that this group of three actually forms a closed circuit, a complex of magical energy ...|$|E
500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What did {{you find}} in {{existence}} {{worth as much as}} <b>this</b> <b>human</b> nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E

500|$|The healing {{elements}} of the movement are difficult to classify given {{that a variety of}} terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things. However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the Human Potential Movement, which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and which accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life. Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the [...] "theoretical wing" [...] of <b>this</b> <b>Human</b> Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness. Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current, which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and which seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.|$|E
