5000|$|The TI-89 {{has been}} criticized for making some {{fundamental}} operations difficult for users to find. This design flaw, known as [...] "cryptic input", can be a drawback for students (particularly those who are used to the user-friendly interface of the previous TI-83 and TI-84 models). An example of this cryptic input is the base 10 logarithm function. Rather than having a key for the log function, users must navigate through a series of menus to find this operation. Alternatively, users can press the [...] "diamond" [...] shift key, followed by the number 7 on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>pad.</b> However, there is no indication on the actual calculator to suggest this short-cut.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{types of}} encryption, by their {{mathematical}} properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An {{example of this}} is one-time pad cryptography, where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer - but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the Venona project, generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation: <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>pads</b> not being truly random, intercepted keypads, operators making mistakes - or other errors.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} exchanging {{information}} is called Communication. The basic Communication system involvestransmitter, receiver and the channel. The data transmitted by the sender reaches receiver through thechannel. The unauthorized parties (cracker,hacker, eavesdropper, or attacker) {{should not be}} able to access the information at the channel. Therefore transmitting data securely from the sender to the receiver is a very important aspect. A cryptographic system is unconditionally secure if the cipher text produced by the system does not contain enough information to determine uniquely the corresponding plaintext, no matter how much cipher text is available. A cryptographic system is said to be computationally secure if the cost of breaking the cipher exceeds the value of the encrypted information and the time required to break the cipher exceeds the useful lifetime of the content. One time pad system can be called as unconditionally secure algorithm, if <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> (<b>pad)</b> usedare truly random in nature. In this paper, we are demonstrating that one-time pad can be used as an efficient encryption scheme by involving arithmetic and logical operations.

Among the 3 -Tier Security layers, Application layer security comes first as it is the topmost layer in OSI model. The visitors always assume about the security and safety of these transactions, and so they are steadily lose their trust on the bank due to increase of various online Internet attacks. Now, it is trying to design an approach to enhance the Application Layer Security in case of online security application. It helps to make a latest idea about online banking transactions as well as increases trust and security over the existing theory, by challenge-response mutual authentication process. This paper says about possible preventions of Password Guessing by padding a random string in the different position of the password depending upon UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time and Nearest Prime Number Concept.
