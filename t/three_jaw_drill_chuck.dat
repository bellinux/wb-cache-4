While convenient, this feature {{can cause the}} chuck to loosen if too much torque is applied. Bottom: the widely used keyed type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> with its key. The arbor is shown separately to the right. These chucks require a toothed key to provide the necessary torque to tighten and loosen the jaws. When the key is turned its teeth mate with teeth on the chuck, turning an internal screw which in turn moves the threaded jaws in or out along a tapered surface. The taper allows the <b>jaws</b> to clamp <b>drill</b> shanks {{of a range of}} diameters. The end view shows the <b>three</b> small <b>jaws</b> that slide within the body.|$|R
50|$|RÖHM {{was founded}} in 1909 in Zella-Mehlis, Thuringia by Heinrich Röhm. Its first product was a two-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> In 1910 the first patent - {{improved}} <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> - was filed. Export business started the same year. Due to the influences of World War I production came to a standstill and resumption {{turned out to be}} difficult {{after the end of the}} war. In 1926, RÖHM started the production of key-type <b>drill</b> <b>chucks.</b> It was the first company in Germany to do so. The following years the manufacturing plants were modernized and extended. Between 1939 and 1940, a 40m conveyor belt for the production of <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> was put into service. Therefore, for the first time, a company produced precision tools in mass production and RÖHM was said to be the most modern and efficient factory of its industry.|$|R
5000|$|Names {{known to}} {{figure in the}} history of chuck {{development}} include those of Simon Fairman (1792-1857) and his son-in-law Austin F. Cushman (1830-1914), and Arthur Irving Jacobs. Fairman invented the piece of tooling that we today would call a scroll chuck, and Cushman developed and sold this design under his business, Cushman Industries. Judging from a historical sketch given by the Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company(a well-known brand in the <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> field), Arthur I. (A.I.) Jacobs was apparently the person who further developed Cushmans self-centering scroll-gear idea into the type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> known today (for which his company would later become famous). A.I. Jacobss patent of 1902 (...) appears to be the principal patent. The term [...] "drill chuck" [...] clearly did not originate with him, but his new type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> evidently long ago displaced any earlier types that lacked the angled jaw movement and outer sleeve now found on all common <b>drill</b> <b>chucks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A pin chuck is a {{specialized}} chuck {{designed to hold}} small drills (less than 1 mm in diameter) {{that could not be}} held securely in a normal <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> The <b>drill</b> is inserted into the pin chuck and tightened; the pin chuck has a shaft which is then inserted into the larger <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> to hold the <b>drill</b> securely. Pin <b>chucks</b> are also used with high-speed rotary tools other than drills, such as die grinders and jig grinders.|$|R

50|$|The name {{is derived}} from the manufacturer, Jacobs (of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> fame), and was {{patented}} 1962-1965 by Clessie Cummins.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> {{may have}} a hollow body that threads {{directly}} onto a lathe's threaded spindle nose. (These are fairly rare, especially nowadays.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1962-65: A diesel {{compression}} braking system, {{eventually to}} be manufactured by Jacobs (of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> fame) and nicknamed the [...] "Jake Brake", was invented and patented by Clessie Cummins.|$|R
50|$|Run-out is {{dynamic and}} cannot be compensated. If a {{rotating}} component, {{such as a}} <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of tapers was to mount drill bits {{directly}} to machine tools, {{such as in the}} tailstock of a lathe, although later <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered drill bits.|$|R
50|$|The {{triangle}} shank {{is almost}} always made by machining three flats on round bar stock. It is intended as a minor modification of a straight shank, still allowing it {{to be held in}} a 3-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> but allowing higher torque transmission and limited slipping.|$|R
50|$|In a {{torque-controlled}} drill, for instance, {{one shaft}} {{is driven by}} a motor and the other drives a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> The clutch connects the two shafts so they may be locked together and spin {{at the same speed}} (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different speeds (disengaged).|$|R
50|$|Machine tool {{operators}} {{must be able}} {{to install}} or remove tool bits quickly and easily. A lathe, for example, has a rotating spindle in its headstock, to which one may want to mount a spur drive or work in a collet. Another example is a drill press, to which an operator may want to mount a bit directly, or using a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ruth: Ruth, with {{gardening}} gloves on, had accidentally mismeasured her boards, {{resulting in}} the third piece being shorter than the first two. When laminating the boards, she does not securely place her bits in the <b>drill's</b> <b>chuck,</b> causing her gloves to be trapped in the drill. Avoiding the gloves from then on, Ruth finishes in 20:07, but admits she needs rehabilitation.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} independent-jaw (non-self-centering) chucks with <b>three</b> <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Axial run-out is {{the result}} of a {{rotating}} component not being parallel with the axis, such as a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced less.|$|R
50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> is a {{specialised}} self-centering, three-jaw chuck, {{usually with}} capacity of 0.5 in or less and rarely greater than 1 in, {{used to hold}} drill bits or other rotary tools. This type of chuck is used on tools ranging from professional equipment to inexpensive hand and power drills for domestic use; it is the type a person who does not normally work with machine tools {{is most likely to}} be familiar with.|$|R
50|$|The flats of a hex shank {{can either}} be {{machined}} on a round shank, as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of hex bar stock. A hex shank can be grasped by a 3-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks. Quarter-inch hex shanks are common for machine screwdriver bits and have spread from that application {{to be used for}} drill bits that are compatible with screwdriver machinery.|$|R
50|$|The {{uppermost}} counterbore tools {{shown in}} the image are the same device. The smaller top item is an insert, the middle shows another three-fluted counterbore insert, assembled in the holder. The shank of this holder is a Morse taper, although there are other machine tapers {{that are used in}} the industry. The lower counterbore is designed to fit into a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.|$|R
50|$|The arbor of a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> {{is often}} a Morse taper and this allows the chuck {{assembly}} to be removed and directly replaced with the shank of a Morse taper drill bit. A range of sleeves {{may be used to}} bring the size of the smaller Morse tapers up {{to the size of the}} drive spindle's larger taper. Sockets are also available to extend the effective length of the drill as well as offering a variety of taper combinations.|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R
5000|$|RÖHM [...] is a German {{chucking}} tool manufacturer. It {{was founded in}} 1909 by Heinrich Röhm. Its headquarters is in Sontheim/Brenz Germany. RÖHM’s range of products includes <b>drill</b> <b>chucks,</b> live centers, face drivers, lathe chucks and independent chucks as well as vices, gripping technology, power chuck technology, mandrels and tool clamping systems. RÖHM currently counts approximately 1500 employees. The company’s products offer solutions especially for the automobile industry, engineering, the energy sector, rail vehicles and aerospace. From the 1950s until 2010, they also manufactured a line of inexpensive firearms under the Röhm Gesellschaft (RG) division. In 2010, RG was sold to Umarex.|$|R

50|$|The Jacobs Taper (abbreviated JT) is {{commonly}} used to secure <b>drill</b> press <b>chucks</b> to an arbor. The taper angles are not consistent varying from 1.41° per side for #0 (and the obscure #) to 2.33° per side for #2 (and #2 short).|$|R
5000|$|The {{straight}} shank {{is the most}} usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same diameter. It is held usually in a 3-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have {{straight shank}}s of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size colet or <b>chuck.</b> Large <b>drill</b> bits can have straight shanks narrower than the drill diameter {{so that they can}} be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a 1/2" [...] bit to be used in a pistol-grip <b>drill's</b> 3/8" [...] <b>chuck.</b> One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from 9/16" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] drill body diameter with a standard 1/2" [...] reduced shank for all. This allows drill presses with 1/2" [...] chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are 6" [...] long with a 3" [...] flute length.|$|R

2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in <b>drill</b> <b>chucks.</b> Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|R
50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} ″ to ″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as <b>drill</b> <b>chucks,</b> fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R-8 taper shank built into or added to the tool.|$|R

5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862.

50|$|Bridgeport manual milling {{machines}} {{have come in}} many types and sizes over the years, including (but not limited to) the C head (original), R head (heavy duty C head), M head, J head (and high speed, 5440 RPM version), 2J1 1/2 head (1.5 HP Vari-Speed), 2J2 (2HP Vari-speed), and Series II head (4HP Vari-speed). All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated variable-speed drive. Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|R
