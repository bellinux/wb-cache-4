5|$|It was {{probably}} Amenhotep I {{who founded the}} artisans village at Deir el-Medina, whose inhabitants were responsible {{for much of the}} art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles. The earliest name found <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Thutmose I, however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the city's workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E

To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel does not voice them.

500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Douglas Avery, and was filmed in Monte Carlo in July 2000. The plot was loosely based on Martin Scorsese's 1995 crime drama movie Casino, with Minogue herself portraying a character using aspects of Sharon Stone's bored trophy wife. Dutch actor Rutger Hauer served as Minogue's on-screen mob partner and husband. According to Hauer, {{no one from the}} set—including the singer, and apart from Avery—knew he was appearing as a cameo. Regarding the on-screen relationship, the singer stated; [...] "In my opinion, the Rutger Hauer character is kind of like a minder or he's in charge of her, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> kind of strong sexual tension." [...] The artist wore three outfits in the video—a multi-coloured dress {{at the start of the}} visual, a black dress during her appearance at a casino in Monte Carlo, and a final blue cocktail dress. She had sported an estimated $2 million worth of jewellery and diamonds during filming, with a few security guards having to accompany her on the set.|$|E

Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality [...] "added to his character ... without really tokenizing him". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the [...] "most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013", calling him [...] "deeply flawed but wholly unique".|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} Keats enjoyed the poem, {{and it was}} heavily quoted in their reviews. An {{anonymous}} review of Keats's poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 Scots Magazine stated: [...] "Amongst the minor poems we prefer the 'Ode to the Nightingale.' Indeed, we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book; but let the reader judge. The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should {{find it difficult to}} explain. We have read this ode over and over again, and every time with increased delight." [...] At the same time, Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats's poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 The Indicator: [...] "As a specimen of the Poems, which are all lyrical, we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the 'Ode to a Nightingale'. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief, which poetry alone presents us in her 'charmed cup,' and which some over-rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true. It does not follow that what is not true to them, is not true to others. If the relief is real, the mixture is good and sufficing." ...|$|E

In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: {{it can be}} said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".|$|E

[...] The major benefit of relocating <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the team is able to partner with the crews of Zed (which was also relocated from Japan) and Zaia at the Macau training facilities. Artists were also able to connect with artists from The House of Dancing Water, the water-based show at The City of Dreams by former Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone. Shows running from March 11 through April 9 were cancelled. The troupe returned and started performances again after facility management had conducted a thorough safety inspection.|$|E

2500|$|Even if it took {{a century}} and a half for many of the book's virtues to be realised, enough was {{recognised}} at the time to make the book one of Hazlitt's most successful. Unsurprisingly the Tory Blackwood's Magazine lamented that the pillory had fallen into disuse and wondered what [...] "adequate and appropriate punishment <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we can inflict on this rabid caitiff". But the majority of the reviewers were enthusiastic. For example, the Eclectic Review marvelled at his ability to [...] "hit off a likeness with a few artist-like touches" [...] and The Gentleman's Magazine, with a few reservations, found his style [...] "deeply impregnated with the spirit of the masters of our language, and strengthened by a rich infusion of golden ore...".|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{have also}} debated {{the issue of}} hearsay in the {{reference}} by Tacitus.

France states that the Tacitus passage is at best just Tacitus repeating what he had heard through Christians. However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that as Rome's preeminent historian, Tacitus was generally known for checking his sources and {{was not in the}} habit of reporting gossip. Tacitus {{was a member of the}} Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, a council of priests whose duty it was to supervise foreign religious cults in Rome, which as Van Voorst points out, makes it reasonable to suppose that he would have acquired knowledge of Christian origins through his work with that body.|$|E

2500|$|Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed {{first for}} Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give {{newspaper}} interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The {{whole question of}} Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last {{the true nature of}} Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [...] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.|$|E

It's almost as if they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us." [...] He said: [...] "I would divide the FBI into two agencies. I would have an anti-domestic crime FBI which was very cautious, very respectful of civil liberties, you are innocent until proven guilty. And I would have a small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. And my first advice to civil libertarians is simple.

He was reportedly horrified when he saw Cherie Blair breastfeeding in public. Tony Blair targeted the Mail titles directly, denouncing [...] "parts of the media that will take what <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> is true and then turn it round into something that is a total distortion of the real truth". Motivated by the Daily Express disallowing the Daily Mail to serialise a biography of Alastair Campbell by then Express employee Peter Oborne, the Mails spoiling exercise led to Campbell contacting Dacre because a Mail article had falsely declared Campbell's father to be dead when, in fact, he was still alive. Dacre had previously told Campbell, that he had not supervised that day's issue. A donation followed to the school of one of Campbell's children.|$|E
