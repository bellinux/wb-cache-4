5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of <b>the</b> <b>wig,</b> representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{initially}} {{as young}} convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following {{his success in}} Thelma & Louise (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) {{when he went to}} audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace at the top of <b>the</b> <b>wig.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Mrs. Goshe would initially—and incorrectly—describe the {{motorcycle}} as being possibly a Honda 350 model, when police questioned Carol Wieczerca, {{a clerk in}} the store adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> shop, Wieczerca was able to state that the model of {{the motorcycle}} upon which Beineman had rode away from <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> shop was actually a Triumph.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{knocking}} down {{a wall in}} order to make space for an extension or repair of the wall would be demolition for a constructive purpose. Combing a wig to set it correctly and pulling out hairs during the procedure with a metal toothed brush or comb would be constructive 'demolition', as each hair that's removed in the process of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> (a utensil) is progressing its state towards a completion which is desired. Each hair's removal is a partial demolition of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> (for these legal purposes) and is considered constructive when viewed in context of the desired goal.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the period, men wore {{their hair}} long with curls {{well past the}} shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the {{forehead}} a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due {{to the success of}} the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs.|$|E

50|$|Wigs {{have been}} used since antiquity as hairstyle and costume; ancient Egyptians wore wigs to shield their shaved heads from the sun. They also wore <b>the</b> <b>wigs</b> {{on top of their}} hair using beeswax and resin to keep <b>the</b> <b>wigs</b> in place. Other ancient cultures, {{including}} the Assyrians, Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans, also used wigs as an everyday fashion.

25|$|Early in the period, {{hair was}} worn collar-length and brushed {{back from the}} forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a lovelock over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, {{pointing}} toward the ascendance of <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> in the 1660s.|$|E

25|$|A {{finding of}} lesser {{importance}} {{is that the}} Younger Lady has a double-pierced ear. Pierced ears were rather common for women of the New Kingdom of Egypt, including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear can not help researchers determine her identity or social position.

Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to <b>the</b> <b>wig's</b> perceived similarities with <b>the</b> type of <b>wigs</b> used by Nefertiti.

Two places assert claims on the marriage and ascension: both Injeong Hall (인정전) at Changdeok Palace and Norak Hall (노락당) at Unhyeon Palace. <b>The</b> <b>wig</b> typically worn by brides at royal weddings was so heavy for the slight 16-year-old bride that a tall court lady was specially assigned to support it from the back.

25|$|Mirren says {{transforming}} {{herself into}} the Queen came almost naturally after <b>the</b> <b>wig</b> and glasses, since she shares a default facial expression—a slightly downturned mouth – with the monarch.

Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, {{by the end of}} production, crew members who had been accustomed to slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing straight up and respectfully folding their hands behind their backs. Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.|$|E
