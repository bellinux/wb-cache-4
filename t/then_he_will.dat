5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E

Finally he will have his inaugural ceremonial ring entry ceremony held at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, which is usually completed within a couple of weeks of the tournament end.|$|E

25|$|Majapahit people, men and women, favoured their head. If {{someone was}} touched on his head, {{or if there}} is a {{misunderstanding}} or argument when drunk, they will instantly draw their knives and stab each other. When the one being stabbed was wounded and dead, the murderer will flee and hide for three days, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not lose his life. But if he was caught during the fight, he will instantly stabbed to death (execution by stabbing). The country of Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men on his hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them, and then stabbed the offender in the back where there is a floating rib which resulted in instant death. Judicial executions of this kind were frequent.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{completed}} tackle, {{all but two}} of the defending team (the markers, see below) must retreat at least ten metres from {{the point at which the}} tackle is made. This distance is marked by the referee. Following the play-the-ball, defenders are permitted to advance to try to put pressure on the attackers and to reduce the distance they can make with the ball. If a defender who has failed to retreat 10 metres interferes with play, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be deemed to have been offside and this will result in a penalty to the attacking team. Equally, if a defender advances too quickly before the ball is played, then this will also result in a penalty to the attackers. When a player kicks the ball their teammates must be behind them or they will be called for offside if they interfere with the play.|$|E
25|$|In August and September 2008, Bangladesh toured Australia {{for three}} ODIs. Before the ODIs started, Mortaza was {{struggling}} with his persistent knee injury. Bangladesh lost all three matches, and although not missing a match, Mortaza failed to take a wicket. After the series, doctors examined the knee and identified a collection of fluid in Mortaza's left knee. He {{was told that he}} can continue bowling for up to a year, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> require minor surgery to drain the fluid. The operation would keep him from playing cricket for six to eight weeks. In September 2008, Mortaza was approached by the Indian Cricket League to join the newly formed Dhaka Warriors. The league was not legitimate according to the ICC, whose lead was followed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), and the 13players who chose to join were given 10-year bans by the BCB. Mortaza turned down the offer, asserting that his main priority was to play for Bangladesh.|$|E

25|$|If an {{individual}} possesses {{a good or}} service whose marginal utility to him is {{less than that of}} some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, {{an individual}} will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do so.|$|E
25|$|For example: As {{a result}} of heavy traffic, a {{recovering}} alcoholic may decide one afternoon to exit the highway and travel on side roads. This {{will result in the}} creation of a high-risk situation when he realizes he is inadvertently driving by his old favorite bar. If this individual is able to employ successful coping strategies, such as distracting himself from his cravings by turning on his favorite music, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> avoid the relapse risk (PATH 1) and heighten his efficacy for future abstinence. If, however, he lacks coping mechanisms—for instance, he may begin ruminating on his cravings (PATH 2)—then his efficacy for abstinence will decrease, his expectations of positive outcomes will increase, and he may experience a lapse—an isolated return to substance intoxication. So doing results in what Marlatt refers to as the Abstinence Violation Effect, characterized by guilt for having gotten intoxicated and low efficacy for future abstinence in similar tempting situations. This is a dangerous pathway, Marlatt proposes, to full-blown relapse.|$|E
25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial, which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son. If he chooses to complete them, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling through a maze composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E
