40|$|Platelet {{preparations}} are {{a source}} of various autologous growth factors and have numerous applications in <b>tissues</b> <b>engineering.</b> The aim of this work was to development electrospun nanofiber scaffolds with platelet preparations. Scaffolds based on the adhesion of platelets on nanofiber meshes were developed. The scaffolds were able to enhance chondrocyte proliferation in vitro. The main disadvantage of this system is the burst release of growth factors immediately after adhesion. To overcome this, we developed coaxially electrospun scaffolds with incorporated alpha granules. Alpha granules are novel platelet preparations with high amounts of growth factors. This system was able to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation and maintain TGF- 1 concentrations for 7 days. Additionally, a novel drug delivery system with coaxially incorporated liposomes was developed. Liposomes incorporated into nanofibers remain intact and can be used for the delivery of various molecules. The ability to maintain HRP activity was compared to systems based on coaxial electrospinning with liposomes, coaxial electrospinning without liposomes and blend electrospinning. When compared to other systems, coaxial electrospinning with liposomes preserves enzyme activity twice as long. These results clearly indicate the potential of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Decellularized {{xenograft}} {{heart valves}} {{might be the}} ideal scaffolds for tissue engineered heart valves as the alternative to the currently used biological and mechanical prostheses. However, removal of the alpha-Gal epitope is a prerequisite to avoid hyperacute rejection of untreated xenograft material. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an ELISA soft-tissue assay for alpha-Gal quantification in xenograft heart valves before and after a detergent-based (TriCol) or equivalent cell removal procedure. Leaflets from porcine valves were enzymatically digested to expose the epitope and reacted with the alpha-Gal monoclonal antibody M 86 for its recognition. Rabbit erythrocytes were used as a reference for the quantification of alpha-Gal. Native aortic and pulmonary leaflets exhibited different epitope concentration: 4. 33 Ã 10 (11) vs. 7. 12 Ã 10 (11) / 10 mg wet tissue (p< 0. 0001). Sampling of selected zones in native valves revealed a different alpha-Gal distribution within and among different leaflets. The pattern was consistent with immunofluorescence analysis and was unrelated to microvessel density distribution. After TriCol treatment alpha-Gal was no longer detectable in both pulmonary and aortic decellularized valves, confirming the ability of this method to remove both cells and alpha-Gal antigen. These results hold promise for a reliable quantitative evaluation of alpha-Gal in decellularized valves obtained from xenograft material for <b>tissues</b> <b>engineering</b> purposes. Additionally, this method is applicable to further evaluate currently used xenograft bioprostheses...|$|R

The term has also been applied to efforts to perform specific biochemical functions using cells within an artificially-created support system (e.g. an artificial pancreas, or a bio artificial liver).

40|$|The recent booming of multiphoton imaging of {{collagen}} fibrils {{by means}} of second harmonic generation microscopy generates {{the need for the}} development and automation of quantitative methods for image analysis. Standard approaches sequentially analyse two-dimensional (2 D) slices to gain knowledge on the spatial arrangement and dimension of the fibrils, whereas the reconstructed three-dimensional (3 D) image yields better information about these characteristics. In this work, a 3 D analysis method is proposed for second harmonic generation images of collagen fibrils, based on a recently developed 3 D fibre quantification method. This analysis uses operators from mathematical morphology. The fibril structure is scanned with a directional distance transform. Inertia moments of the directional distances yield the main fibre orientation, corresponding to the main inertia axis. The collaboration of directional distances and fibre orientation delivers a geometrical estimate of the fibre radius. The results include local maps as well as global distribution of orientation and radius of the fibrils over the 3 D image. They also bring a segmentation of the image into foreground and background, as well as a classification of the foreground pixels into the preferred orientations. This accurate determination of the spatial arrangement of the fibrils within a 3 D data set will be most relevant in biomedical applications. It brings the possibility to monitor remodelling of collagen tissues upon a variety of injuries and to guide <b>tissues</b> <b>engineering</b> because biomimetic 3 D organizations and density are requested for better integration of implants...|$|R
40|$|Stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI), as an isolated symptom, {{is not a}} life threatening condition. However, the fear of unexpected urine leakage contributes to a significant decline in quality of life parameters for afflicted patients. Compared {{to other forms of}} incontinence, SUI cannot be easily treated with pharmacotherapy since it is inherently an anatomic problem. Treatment options include the use of bio-injectable materials to enhance closing pressures, and the placement of slings to bolster fascial support to the urethra. However, histologic findings of degeneration in the incontinent urethral sphincter invite the use of <b>tissues</b> <b>engineering</b> strategies to regenerate structures that aid in promoting continence. In this review, we will assess the role of stem cells in restoring multiple anatomic and physiological aspects of the sphincter. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells and CD 34 + cells have shown great promise to differentiate into muscular and vascular components, respectively. Evidence supporting the use of cytokines and growth factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor further enhance the viability and direction of differentiation. Bridging the benefits of stem cells and growth factors involves the use of synthetic scaffolds like poly (1, 8 -octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) thin films. POC scaffolds are synthetic, elastomeric polymers that serve as substrates for cell growth, and upon degradation, release growth factors to the microenvironment in a controlled, predictable fashion.
