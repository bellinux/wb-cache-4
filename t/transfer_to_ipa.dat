40|$|Spent Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) {{that not}} {{recovered}} must be managed as schedule waste {{which is quite}} costly and give significant impact to the environmental issues. Thus,the main objective {{of this research is}} to suggest the reuse approach for spent IPA by using simple evaporation process because the <b>IPA</b> is easily <b>to</b> vaporize. The spent IPA recovery is studied by determine the effect of operating temperature and volume of spent <b>IPA</b> <b>to</b> the evaporation process. Besides,by analyzing the concentration of precious metals in the spent IPA,it will guide further research on precious metal recovery. The spent IPA taken from an electronic company will be recovered by using rotary evaporator that is easily to be handled. In the experiments,increasing in temperature will increased the evaporation rate because more heat is <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> the spent <b>IPA.</b> Therefore,the reusable IPA vapour can easily released since the kinetic energy of spent IPA molecule is also increasing. In varying the spent IPA volume, 98. 3 % of the spent IPA can be recovered <b>to</b> reusable <b>IPA</b> where another 1. 7 % will be in concentrated residual that consists of discarded solder paste in surface mount technology process. Besides,by using atomic adsorption spectrometer,metal concentration after leaching process is 5. 214 ppm of copper and 0. 8213 ppm of silver. In conclusion, high percentage of spent IPA can be recovered at the optimum temperature 80 oC,and concentration of metal in the spent IPA can be determined. Thus, it is recommended for the electronic company to optimize the usage of IPA...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Phlebotomists occupationally exposed <b>to</b> {{isopropanol}} (<b>IPA)</b> (2 -propanol) and naïve controls (n = 12 per group) {{were exposed}} to the time-weighted average threshold limit value of 400 p. p. m. IPA for 4 h in an environmental chamber to investigate: (i) acute effects of sensory irritation using subjective health symptom reports and objective, physiological end-points; and (ii) differences in measured effects in relation to exposure history. Methods. Before, during and after exposure subjects gave self-reports of health complaints. During exposure subjects rated the intensity of the odor, sensory irritation and annoyance. Objective end-points of ocular hyperemia, nasal congestion, nasal secretion and respiration were obtained at various times before, during and after exposure. Results were compared with exposure to phenylethyl alcohol (PEA), a negative control for irritation, and to clean air (CA), a negative control for odor and irritation, using a within-subjects design. Results. Significantly higher intensity ratings of odor, irritation and annoyance were reported during the exposure <b>to</b> <b>IPA,</b> when compared with exposure to CA or PEA. Nevertheless, the overall level of reported sensory irritation <b>to</b> <b>IPA</b> was low and perceived as ‘weak’ on average. Health symptom ratings were not significantly elevated for IPA as compared with PEA or CA exposure. The only physiological end-point that showed a change exclusively in the IPA condition was respiration frequency: relative to baseline, respiration frequency increased in response <b>to</b> <b>IPA</b> in both groups. No differences were encountered between the occupationally exposed and the control groups. Conclusions. The increase in respiration frequency in response <b>to</b> <b>IPA</b> may reflect either a reflexive change due to sensory irritation (an autonomic event) or a voluntary change in breathing in response to perception of an unpleasant, solvent-like odor (a physiological event caused by cognitive mediation). Our findings on objective end-points, including nasal and ocular sensory irritation, did not confirm subjective irritation reports. Irritation reports and odor intensity decreased, rather than increased, over time, lending credence to the cognitive argument and suggesting that the elevated subjective responses <b>to</b> <b>IPA</b> may be mediated by responses to its odor...|$|R

40|$|Shigellosis is a {{major cause}} of infant {{morbidity}} and mortality in developing countries. To find immunological correlates of specific protection against shigellosis, we examined chronological samples of sera, stool extracts, duodenal aspirates, and saliva samples from 39 adults and 22 children with shigellosis from Peru for the presence of specific antibody to invasion plasmid antigens (<b>Ipa)</b> common <b>to</b> all virulent Shigella strains, by using both a whole-organism enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Western blot (immunoblot) assay. Antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Shigella serotypes both homologous and heterologous to the infecting strain were also determined by ELISA. ELISAs showed that the highest serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers to Shigella whole organisms both with and without surface Ipa were found in adults and malnourished children, the two groups with the shortest and longest durations of disease, respectively. Mucosal IgA antibody titers to Shigella strains decreased over time to a much greater extent than serum IgG titers, and IgA <b>to</b> <b>Ipa</b> in mucosal secretions was found in adults and well-nourished children but not in malnourished children. The presence of mucosal antibody <b>to</b> <b>Ipa</b> may limit the spread and severity of the infection, as indicated by the prolonged illness observed in malnourished children who have no significant mucosal antibody <b>to</b> Shigella <b>Ipa.</b> Serum antibody titers <b>to</b> the <b>Ipa</b> antigens were high relative to anti-Shigella LPS antibody titers, especially in pediatric patients. In contrast to the anti-Ipa responses observed, no differences in antibody responses to LPS in children compared by nutritional status were found. High levels of serum and mucosal cross-reacting antibody to heterologous serotype LPS were found between Shigella flexneri serotypes 1 a and 2 a. Different patterns of immune response <b>to</b> <b>Ipa</b> proteins and LPS that may aid in the definition of Shigella antigens important in host protection were observed in adults, well-nourished children, and malnourished children...|$|R

40|$|The Mxi-Spa type III {{secretion}} {{system of}} Shigella flexneri directs the host cell contact-induced secretion {{of a set}} of invasins, referred <b>to</b> as <b>Ipas.</b> In this study, we examined the role of Spa 33 in Ipa secretion. A spa 33 -null mutant was both noninvasive and unable <b>to</b> translocate the <b>Ipas</b> from inner membrane to outer membrane (OM) positions of the Mxi-Spa transmembrane channel. Spa 33 was found to be a Mxi-Spa substrate that is translocated to the bacterial cell surface upon the induction of Ipa secretion. This mobility may serve <b>to</b> drive <b>Ipa</b> translocation within Mxi-Spa toward OM positions. Consistent with a second distinct role in regulating Ipa traffic, the overexpression of Spa 33 also blocked Ipa secretion and resulted in Ipa accumulation at the OM. Co-overexpression of Spa 33 and another OM-associated element, Spa 32, did not disrupt Ipa secretion, suggesting an interaction between the two proteins and an effect on the mechanism which serves <b>to</b> regulate <b>Ipa</b> release from the OM. These findings indicate that Spa 33 is a mobile element within Mxi-Spa, which is required <b>to</b> control <b>Ipa</b> translocation into and out of OM positions of the secretory structure...|$|R
