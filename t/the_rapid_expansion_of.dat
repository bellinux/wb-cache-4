5000|$|The smoothbore {{artillery}} {{was also}} categorized by the bore dimensions, {{based on the}} rough weight of the solid shot projectile fired from the weapon. For instance a 12-pounder field gun fired a 12-pound solid shot projectile from its 4.62 in diameter bore. It was practice, {{dating back to the}} 18th century, to mix gun and howitzers into batteries. Pre-war allocations called for 6-pounder field guns matched with 12-pounder howitzers, 9 and 12-pounder field guns matched with 24-pounder howitzers.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged {{as the focus of}} the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|E

5|$|Social {{life during}} the Song was vibrant. Citizens {{gathered}} to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread {{of literature and}} knowledge was enhanced by <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable-type printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished {{over the course of}} the Song. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although the institution of the civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the exams became a leading factor in the shift from a military-aristocratic elite to a bureaucratic elite.|$|E
5|$|The town grew rapidly {{during the}} {{industrial}} revolution as urbanisation took place and the town became an area of mercantile prosperity and overcrowded poverty. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deep water ports at Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth. Poole's first railway station opened in Hamworthy in 1847 and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872, effectively ending the port's busy coastal shipping trade. The beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south-west Hampshire began to attract tourists during the 19th century and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the seaside resort of Bournemouth emerged. Although Poole did not become a resort like many of its neighbours, it continued to prosper as <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Bournemouth created a large demand for goods manufactured in Poole.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer which leads to <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{made her}} first {{priority}} {{the raising of}} the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children. Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen and women were given grants to train as teachers on an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained {{by the end of}} 1946. <b>The</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts—some of which became long-term features of schools. Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947—the date set by the 1944 Act—and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track. Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the Vengeance force, by late 1942 the RAAF {{was aware}} that the type was {{obsolete}} and other Allied air forces' experiences had demonstrated that dive bombing was an inefficient tactic. Combat experience in Europe showed that dedicated dive bombers were highly vulnerable to attack from fighter aircraft, especially when preparing to dive on targets. Few USAAF officers regarded dive bombers as effective, though they were frequently used by the United States Navy. A USAAF squadron equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers was deployed to New Guinea in April 1942, but was withdrawn from combat {{at the end of}} May that year after flying only a few combat sorties. The USAAF regarded this type as unsuited to conditions in the theatre, though the US Navy operated it very successfully from its aircraft carriers as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF preferred to use fighter-bombers and light bombers to support ground troops in New Guinea, fighter-bombers especially as they could strafe and skip bomb Japanese positions as well as employ dive-bombing tactics. Similarly, by late 1942 the RAAF preferred to use the light bombers that it was now beginning to receive to provide tactical support for the Army. An order for 150 Curtis Shrike dive bombers was cancelled after the first ten of these aircraft were delivered to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the only dedicated dive bomber operated by the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|Philipp was {{transferred}} to the I. Gruppe of Kampfgeschwader 253 (I./KG253—1st group of the 253rd Bomber Wing) on 1 March 1938. This assignment did not suit Philipp, and on 1 May 1938 he managed to get himself transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule Werneuchen (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, then under the command of Oberst (Colonel) Theodor Osterkamp. The Anschluß, the 1938 occupation and annexation of Austria into the German Reich, spawned <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffe. Philipp's fighter pilot career benefited from this expansion and he {{was transferred}} to the I./Jagdgeschwader 138 (I./JG138—1st group of the 138th Fighter Wing) stationed in Wien-Schwechat on 1 July 1938. Here he underwent flight conversion training from the Heinkel He 51 biplane to the then modern Messerschmitt Bf 109. This posed challenges, and on 21 June and again 19 July 1939, he damaged his Bf109 during takeoff and landing. In 1939, Philipp bought a DKW Meisterklasse automobile. With this car he went on a tour through Italy where he met his future fiancée Katharina Egger from South Tyrol. On 1 May 1939, his unit I./JG138 was re-designated I./Jagdgeschwader 76 (I./JG76—1st group of the 76th Fighter Wing).|$|E
5|$|The {{maritime}} fur trade {{brought the}} Pacific Northwest coast into a vast, new international trade network, {{centered on the}} north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on capitalism, but not, for the most part, on colonialism. A triangular trade network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the Hawaiian Islands (only recently discovered by the Western world), Britain, and the United States (especially New England). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the Aleut, Sugpiaq, Tlingit, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Chinook peoples. A rapid increase of wealth occurred among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, potlatching, slaving, and depopulation due to epidemic disease. However, the indigenous culture was not overwhelmed by rapid change, but actually flourished. For instance, the importance of totems and traditional nobility crests increased, and the Chinook Jargon, which remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture, was developed during this era. Native Hawaiian society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal, but for New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to its transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially textile manufacturing. The New England textile industry in turn had a large effect on slavery in the United States, increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the cotton plantation system across the Deep South.|$|E
