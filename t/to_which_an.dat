5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} held {{a meeting}} on December 10 at 9am in the Saint George's School and Gërmenji held {{a speech to the}} gathered men and after the meeting led the commission to the prefecture. In the prefecture they met with Colonel Descoins and with the other French officers. Haki Shemshedini approached to Colonel Descoins on behalf of the commission. Colonel Descoins informed the commission that they should sign a protocol. On December 10, 1916 Colonel Descoins and the commission signed a protocol, according <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> autonomous province would be established on the territories of Korçë, Bilishti, Kolonja, Opar and Gora. It was also agreed that the 14 members of the commission would make up the administrative council, responsible for maintaining order.|$|E
25|$|Intermittency {{can mean}} the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable, but intermittency is {{frequently}} used as synonym of variability, which is the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> power source may exhibit changes in output.|$|R
30|$|The {{simplicity}} {{dimension of}} the technologies is referred as the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> technology is easy to understand, operate and use, whereas, complexity refers to the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> technology is difficult to use and understand.|$|R
50|$|In {{scientific}} research, {{internal validity}} {{is the extent}} <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> causal conclusion based on a study is warranted, which {{is determined by the}} degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> study minimizes systematic error (or 'bias'). It contrasts with external validity, the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> it is warranted to generalize results to other contexts.|$|R
5|$|The cover art was {{illustrated}} by sci-fi/fantasy artist Michael Whelan, following {{the style of}} Richard Corben's cover for Bat Out of Hell. It features the biker from the first cover flying on his motorcycle towards a giant bat perched on top of New York City's Chrysler Building, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> angel is bound. Echoing the gravestones of the first cover, partially destroyed skyscrapers inhabit the lava landscape. Also like the first album, it features a 'Songs by Jim Steinman' credit, although smaller and located {{at the bottom of}} the cover.|$|E

40|$|Overshadowing (Experiment 1) and {{blocking}} (Experiment 2) were investigated using a conditioned suppression paradigm in rats. Neither hippocampectomy nor cortical control lesions affected the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> salient stimulus overshadowed a less salient one. Nor did the lesions affect the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> stimulus that was {{highly correlated with}} shock overshadow a stimulus that was less well correlated with shock. Finally, the lesions did not alter the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> previously reinforced stimulus blocked conditioning to another stimulus when both were presented as a reinforced compound stimulus. It is thus possible for hippocampectomized rats to show apparently normal overshadowing {{and blocking}}, at least under some testing conditions...|$|R
25|$|Altruism versus Antagonism: Although shared {{between three}} HEXACO factors, Altruism versus Antagonism is {{moderately}} correlated with Agreeableness. This interstitial facet assesses the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual is sympathetic, soft-hearted, and helpful, with low-scoring individuals tending toward an antagonistic interpersonal style.|$|E
25|$|Group-serving dishonesty/deception: In a {{carefully}} controlled study exploring the biological roots of immoral behavior, oxytocin {{was shown to}} promote dishonesty when the outcome favored the group <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual belonged instead of just the individual.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a polymer such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole) {{is used as}} a host {{material}} <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> organometallic {{complex is}} added as a dopant. Iridium complexes such as Ir(mppy)3 are currently the focus of research, although complexes based on other heavy metals such as platinum have also been used.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan have {{conducted}} research that {{eventually led to}} the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT). This theory focuses on the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined. SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Most verbs {{are built}} {{up from a}} monosyllabic lexical root ending in a vowel or a single consonant, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> {{extension}} or stem consonant is very often added. The extensions correlate with transitivity: transitive stems have either -k- or -b- (unpredictably), while intransitive stems have -w-. There is also a valency-decreasing verb-prefix ai- which, added to transitive stems, produces unergative, reflexive, reciprocal or middle verbs. See the section on Derivation (below) for examples.|$|E
25|$|A {{representation}} {{is a type}} of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> artistic representation resembles the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the Mona Lisa and a child's crayon drawing of Lisa del Giocondo would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.|$|E

30|$|In this study, user {{satisfaction}} {{refers to the}} extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> student learning MIS is pleased {{with the use of}} weblogs in the course (Liao, Huang, & Wang, 2015). Perceived usefulness refers <b>to</b> extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> student learning MIS believes that using weblogs would enhance his or her learning performance in the course (Davis, 1989; Lin, 2012). Confirmation refers to the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> student’s initial expectations about the performance of using weblogs to learn MIS is being confirmed after having an experience with such tools (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Lee, 2010). Continuance usage intention refers to a student’s subjective likelihood of continuing to use weblogs to learn MIS (Bhattacherjee, 2001).|$|R
25|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) {{was developed}} by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses {{on the importance of}} intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.|$|E
25|$|As {{delineated}} {{in various}} writings, the meticulousness, articulation, and sophistication with which Socrates spoke supplies an outstanding problem solving technique – the Socratic Method. The Socratic method may {{be described as}} follows: it usually involves others with whom Socrates directly engages (not merely pontificating to an audience), it involves a deep philosophical or ethical question <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> answer was sought, and it usually involves Socrates asking questions either to affirm his understanding of others or to seek their understanding.|$|E
25|$|Within the Army, British {{officers}} who initially {{trained at the}} company's own academy at the Addiscombe Military Seminary, always outranked Indians, {{no matter how long}} their service. The highest rank <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Rissaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior subaltern equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.|$|E
