The brain processes <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

More sophisticated methods include z-ratio, loess and lowess regression and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, in situ synthesised short oligonucleotides).|$|E
25|$|Those {{observations}} that succeed in passing all these tests {{were taken to}} the second step of computer processing, with fitting of a second-degree polynomial curve to the raw range/time data in accordance with least squares criteria. In this method, a mathematical function was fit to best approximate a series of observations where the sum of squares of its residuals (deviations from <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data)</b> was least. If there was systematic irregularity in the reliability of the data, the residuals were weighted accordingly.|$|E

25|$|Raw CMBR {{data from}} the space vehicle (i.e. WMAP) contain {{foreground}} effects that completely obscure the fine-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background. The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but {{is too small to}} be seen at the scale of <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data.</b> The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun's motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth's annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background.|$|E
25|$|Processing of <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> – such as {{normalization}} to {{the median}} signal – was needed on MinION raw data, reducing real-time {{capability of the}} technology. Consistency of the electrical signals is still an issue, {{making it difficult to}} accurately call a nucleotide. MinION has low throughput; since multiple overlapping reads are hard to obtain, this further leads to accuracy problems of downstream DNA modification detection. Both the hidden Markov model and statistical methods used with MinION raw data require repeated observations of DNA modifications for detection, meaning that individual modified nucleotides need to be consistently present in multiple copies of the genome, e.g. in multiple cells or plasmids in the sample.|$|E
25|$|The {{pits and}} lands do not {{directly}} represent the zeros and ones of binary data. Instead, non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: {{a change from}} pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There {{must be at least}} two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding, finally revealing <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the Red Book) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM).|$|E

[9] recommended to aggregate <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> traffic <b>data</b> to 5 -min level. In this study, <b>the</b> extracted <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> were selected 5 – 10  min prior to crash occurrence {{time in order to}} avoid confusing pre- and post-crash conditions. The original 20 -s traffic data, flow (Q n), speed (V n), occupancy (C n) on each lane(L n) are aggregated into a 5 -min level.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. and ARVN units {{participating}} in Apache Snow knew, based on existing intelligence information and previous {{experience in the}} A Shau, that the operation was likely to encounter serious resistance from PAVN. Beyond that, however, they had little intelligence as to the actual strength and dispositions of PAVN units. The area was extremely remote and difficult to access. Aerial surveillance was difficult. U.S. battalion commanders had to generate their own tactical intelligence by combat patrols, capturing equipment, installations, documents, and occasionally prisoners of war to provide <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> from which to draw their assessment of the North Vietnamese order of battle and dispositions. It was this time-consuming and hit-or-miss task force which characterized the main efforts of Colonel Honeycutt's 3/187th Infantry during the first four days of the operation.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{statistical}} {{learning by}} itself cannot account {{even for those}} aspects of language acquisition for which {{it has been shown}} to play a large role. For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition. Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> of hearing a language, they are unable {{to take advantage of the}} statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.|$|E
25|$|A French {{scientist}} {{notable for}} his anti-GM perspective, Gilles-Eric Seralini, {{raised concerns about}} some of the differences between feeding trials using the genetically modified and unmodified brinjal, and criticized some of the testing protocols. The EC-II responded to the concerns raised by Seralini and other scientists in their report, New Zealand epidemiologist Lou Gallagher also criticised the feeding trials saying that <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> indicated toxic effects were associated with the rats fed Bt Brinjal. Concerns have also been raised about a possible conflict of interest, with some of the scientists appointed to the GEAC being involved in developing their own GM products, that the decision by the EC-II was not unanimous, and about the reliability of safety data originating from Mahcyo run trials. The imposed moratorium has been criticized by some scientists as not being based on any compelling scientific evidence and potentially setting Indian biotechnology back decades. Others feel the critical issue is not the safety of the GM technology, but its corporatization and there are claims that India’s crop protection industry was a major player in preventing the commercialization of the Bt brinjal. India's National Biodiversity Authority is probing the crop scientists involved in developing the Bt brinjal for allegedly violating India's Biological Diversity Act, 2002 by using local cultivars and foreign technology without their permission.|$|E

500|$|As {{soon as the}} map of Britain was {{published}} Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture {{for him in the}} sense that never before had he collected <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: [...] "The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement {{as a result of his}} terrifying experiences." [...] Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey.
