5|$|The ECSC {{was founded}} by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no {{decision}} on where to base <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the new community.

5|$|The {{report of}} the battle in the Annals of Ulster says {{that none of the}} kings or mormaers among the men of Alba were killed.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E
5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed a danger to her monarchical authority. Not without much hesitation and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E
5|$|In around 180, Clement reached Alexandria, {{where he}} met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Eusebius {{suggests}} that Pantaenus {{was the head of}} the school, but it is controversial whether <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the school were formalized in this way before the time of Origen. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's life in Alexandria. He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{into two}} kingdoms {{is most likely}} to date back to the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> kingship as a subkingdom. This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the ECSC {{were the}} High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was {{established}} alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing civil society. This {{was the first}} international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|E

5000|$|The Hazards Forum, {{founded in}} 1989, is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental, {{professional}} association promoting {{the study of}} disasters (and resulting learning), public understanding of risk and of risk reduction strategies.

He also maintained ties with the provincial government; in 1966, he formally became part of the Regional Representatives' Council, and in 1976, at the recommendation of Governor Arifin Achmad, he went on the hajj using state funds.|$|E
5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> central government, {{which had}} {{hitherto}} accompanied the royal English court {{as it moved}} around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came {{to rest in the}} Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. Disaster struck {{in the form of the}} Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population. London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.|$|E

5|$|Kings did {{not rule}} alone, but rather governed {{together}} with the leading churchmen and nobles. While Northumbria lacks the body of charters which shed light on <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of Northumbrian political life. The evidence for Northumbria survives largely in Latin documents, and these use the words dux and patricius to describe the leading noblemen of the kingdom. The word dux is usually translated by the Old English word ealdorman. The historian Alan Thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding the title of dux in late Northumbria. The title patricius is usually translated as patrician, which ultimately means noble, but in the latter days of the Roman Empire represented a high-ranking position, {{second only to the}} emperor. The meaning of the title in Northumbria is unclear, but it appears that there was only one patricius. While it may be simply an alternative to dux, it might represent a position approximating to that of the Mayor of the Palace in late Merovingian Francia.|$|E
5|$|On Malta, the French had rapidly {{dismantled}} <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> the Knights of St. John, {{including the}} Roman Catholic Church. Church property was looted and seized {{to pay for}} the expedition to Egypt, an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta. Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular Maltese soldiers led by Emmanuele Vitale and Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{widespread}} attempts to codify {{and comment on}} the Scottish legal system. The first substantive account of Scottish law was the Practicks of Bishop John Sinclair (d. 1566), senator of the College of Justice. This was followed by James Balfour's (c. 1525–83) Practicks, who with Sir John Skene of Curriehill (c. 1543–1617), was a major figure in the move to codification. Skene produced an edition of the Acts of Parliament and a legal dictionary, De Verborum Significatione and edited Regiam Maisestatem, {{a history of the}} Scottish law, which attributed much of its creation to David I. Thomas Craig of Riccarton (c. 1538–1608) produced two large works, Jus Feudale, which examined feudal law, and De Unione Regnorum Britanniae, which explored the possibilities of unifying the English and Scottish legal systems. Often seen as the beginning of modern Scottish legal study is James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair's (1619–95) <b>The</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> the Law of Scotland (1681).|$|E
