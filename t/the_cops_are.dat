5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a {{performance}} of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, {{the head of the}} CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by antagonists after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> killed.|$|E
500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music.

40|$|AbstractIn off-spin bowling (finger-spin {{delivery}} with a sidespin, right-handed bowler), {{the ball}} rolls {{over the middle}} finger and rotates counterclockwise, as seen by the batsman. It is therefore expected that the torque imparted onto the ball is generated by the middle finger and the centre of pressure (<b>COP)</b> <b>is</b> also located close to the middle finger. The off-spin bowling action was recorded in five bowlers with a smart cricket ball and <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> determined. In two bowlers, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> located at <b>the</b> middle finger and moved clockwise, i. e. against {{the sense of the}} ball, inherent to rolling motion. In one bowler, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> shifted slightly to the index finger, indicating a small contribution by the index to torque generation. Another bowler initiated the torque generation with the index finger, and then <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> moved from index to middle finger. The fifth bowler produced a rare case of braking i. e. deceleration of the ball at release, with the tip of the index finger, as seen in the location of <b>the</b> <b>COP.</b> In this case, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> moved from <b>the</b> middle finger to the index. This preliminary study of off-spin bowling contributes to the understanding of torque generation, confirming that the primary torque generation is by the middle finger, a mechanism that could be more effective when combined with the torque generation by the index finger...|$|R
