5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the UN Security Council has embraced mainstream feminist ideas {{in a manner}} that may ultimately be detrimental to women's lives. The paper asks why some elements of feminist debates (victim feminism, formal equality, quotas) have been develop under the 1325 framework while the spectrum of feminist thinking on women's diversity, on self-determination and on structural bias within legal systems has been so difficult to develop into concrete reforms. Ultimately the process of pursuing feminist ideas in the mainstream and into institutional settings is a rejection of specific feminist approaches that are consequently shifted to <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> feminist methods and remain beyond <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> international legal discussions...|$|R
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> Hindu society.|$|E
5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> <b>of</b> the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm.

Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm. It became an extratropical cyclone, occluding near the time of landfall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} asymmetries of pulsar {{distributions}} {{relative to the}} Galactic plane in various Galactic longitudes. It is shown that the observed asymmetric distribution {{may be explained by}} the warped and flaring (i. e. increase <b>of</b> scale-height at <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galaxy) structure of the Galaxy. At <b>the</b> <b>peripheries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galaxy, the amplitude of the warp, derived from these data, may be as high as ∼ 1 kpc. The scale-height of the pulsar distribution increases exponentially from ∼ 0. 5 kpc to ∼ 1 kpc while increasing the galactocentric distance from 5 kpc to 15 kpc. The warp and flare parameters derived from the pulsar data are compared with the stellar and gaseous warp and flare parameters of the Galaxy. ...|$|R
