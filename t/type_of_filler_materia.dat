40|$|Modulus of {{elasticity}} {{is one of}} {{the mechanical}} properties of composite resins affects the resistance to deformation, the strength of bonding with tooth structure and wear resistance. Modulus of elasticity is determined by the volume fraction <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particles as the inorganic phase composite resin. This literature study aims to evaluate the size, shape and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particles that affect the modulus of elasticity for composite resin. In a constant volume fraction, the larger size <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> material tends to make more rigid while irregular shape of particles produces higher modulus of elasticity than spherical form of particles. In addition, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particles also determines the modulus of elasticity for resin composite, such as silica as the main <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particles will enhance the modulus of elasticity whereas zirconium can result in a higher stiffness.

In this paper we investigate the synchronization between an utterance <b>of</b> a <b>filler</b> and the speaker's gaze.

Multiple regression analysis was performed for dependent variables studied and to evaluate contribution of factors with their levels two way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey test. Polynomial equations and response surface plots were generated for all dependent variables. It was observed that both the factors had significant influence on all dependent variable studied (p&# 60; 0. 05). It was observed that as viscosity of polymer increases the release rate constant was decreased. Release rate obtained was highest when microcrystalline cellulose was employed as filler followed by dicalcium phosphate and lactose. Mechanism of drug release was anomalous types and depends upon viscosity <b>of</b> polymer and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> used. Microcrystalline cellulose gave release mechanism nearer to diffusion mechanism while dicalcium phosphate and lactose gave anomalous release. It was observed that both the factors had significant contribution on all dependent variables studied.
