5|$|In the end, Johnson {{received}} only forty-eight electoral votes. One elector from Virginia and all eleven from South Carolina voted for Van Buren for president but selected {{someone other than}} Johnson for vice-president. Johnson lost {{his home state of}} Kentucky again and added to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> by losing his home district as well.|$|E
5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of losing one of his Coburg properties.|$|E
5|$|Gunn made six full {{international}} appearances for Scotland, conceding 10 goals. He was {{a member}} of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament, as he was third-choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram. He made his Scotland debut in a pre-tournament friendly match against Egypt, but was at fault for two Egyptian goals, resulting in a 3–1 defeat for Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>embarrassment</b> was made worse by the fact that his parents were watching. Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. His last cap was as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in May 1994.|$|E
60|$|Sterne, meditating on <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of that stupidity, forgot himself completely. His stony, unwinking stare {{was fixed}} on the planks of the deck.|$|R
6000|$|Georgina got up, holding rather {{higher than}} before that {{beautiful}} head which, {{in spite of}} <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of this interview, had not yet perceptibly abated of its elevation. [...] "Would you have liked me to--to not marry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anna {{leaned back}} in the chair and laughed softly. Even this man had {{accepted}} her for [...] "Alcide" [...] without a moment's question. Then all <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of <b>the</b> matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly grave.|$|R
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the French. According to unofficial accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned and at least 300wounded, in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko {{was elected}} Deputy to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E
5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and new elections to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.|$|E

25|$|Claire’s {{relationship}} with Julia is closer than her {{relationship with}} anyone else. She and Julia identify {{with one another in}} their roles as the “other”—people on the periphery of Tobias’s and Agnes’s lives. Claire and Julia are the rebels, <b>the</b> failures, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> that must be tolerated. When Julia arrives home, Claire greets her more honestly, more warmly than do Julia’s parents.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the Yankees and Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike.|$|E

25|$|The Beijing Guo’an {{football}} club {{was scheduled to}} play at the stadium, but later backed out of their agreement, citing <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of using an 80,000+ seat venue for games that routinely draw only slightly more than 10,000.|$|E
50|$|Deaths of Bangladeshi {{citizens}} in the Indo-Bangladesh border became one of <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> between <b>the</b> two nation’s bilateral relations in recent years. The so-called ‘shoot-to-kill’ policy by India’s Border Security Forces (BSF) that according to Human Rights Watch killed nearly 1,000 Bangladeshis between 2001 and 2011 has remained {{at the core of}} the talks between Bangladeshi and Indian officials visiting each other.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{suddenly}} was Mrs Durby {{bereft of}} her treasure and thrown into abject despair.

25|$|The Iranian {{reaction}} to 6 April press conference was {{to dismiss the}} entire thing as propaganda and {{to claim that the}} former captives had been dictated to by the British authorities into defaming Iran to hide <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of having violated Iranian waters.|$|E
25|$|As if <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of high {{involvement}} of the commoner in the agitations were not enough for the Congress, Baktavatsalam further added fuel to fire by claiming that he possessed documents proving the {{involvement of}} DMK in instigating violence, the documents which he could never publish.|$|E
25|$|At this time, {{it appears}} that Wiborada was charged with some type of serious infraction or wrongdoing, and was {{subjected}} to the medieval practice of ordeal by fire to prove her innocence. Although she was exonerated, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> probably influenced her next decision: withdrawing from the world and becoming an ascetic.|$|E

6000|$|I had {{gradually}} {{formed the}} habit of talking with Walkirk on other subjects than my travels, and one evening I mentioned to him some of <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> and annoyances to which I had been subjected during the day, {{on account of the}} varied character of my affairs. Walkirk sat for a minute or two, his chin in his hand, gazing steadfastly upon the carpet; then he spoke:-- ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the incident his unit was posted to North Africa without him while he remained on a charge. He was subsequently invalided out of the RAF on medical grounds.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1935, {{numerous}} factors combined {{which resulted}} in the termination of the highway camps. The federal government of R. B. Bennett used Section 98 of the Criminal Code in 1931 to arrest several leaders of the Communist Party of Canada. However, the lack of evidence and protests would eventually lead to the early release of the men, much to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of the government.|$|E
25|$|Brandy Station was {{the largest}} {{predominantly}} cavalry fight of the war, and the largest to take place on American soil. It was a tactical draw, although Pleasonton withdrew before finding the location of Lee's infantry nearby and Stuart claimed a victory, attempting to disguise <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of a cavalry force being surprised as it was by Pleasonton. The battle established the emerging reputation of the Union cavalry as a peer of the Confederate mounted arm.|$|E
5000|$|For Bloom, “the Covering Cherub then is a demon of continuity...cultural history, {{the dead}} poets, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of a {{tradition}} grown too wealthy to need anything more”. [...] Bloom considered the artistic struggle in Freudian terms, as a filial contest with a father figure carrying cultural authority - an Oedipal conflict with a superego either originally modelled on a culture hero, or influenced subsequently by such an ideal model.|$|R

25|$|On {{her next}} voyage, {{which was also}} her first transpacific crossing, the {{problems}} recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of having his celebrated new vessel declared unseaworthy by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships. Even with the problems however, City of Peking had still managed to set a new speed record of 22 days on her first San Francisco to Hong Kong crossing.|$|E
25|$|Pardew {{moved to}} Charlton Athletic in November 1991, and was Charlton's top scorer in the 1992–93 season with ten goals. In 1995, Pardew {{appeared}} four times on loan at Tottenham Hotspur in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He {{played in the}} team who suffered <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> {{of being involved in}} Spurs' record defeat {{in the history of the}} club, when they lost 8–0 away to German side 1. FC Köln. Spurs had fielded a team made up of reserves and loanees, including Pardew, for their final group game in Cologne.|$|E
25|$|Visiting {{politicians}} and senior bureaucrats from South Asian countries {{are known to}} lack basic sense of social decorum and diplomatic finesse while on official representation. Lack of preparation in diplomatic protocol, cultural norms, culinary skills and restroom etiquette makes them prone to committing faux-pas to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of their hosts, muted helplessness of embassy staff and amusement of the press-corps. Chinese officials are known {{to pay attention to}} their outward appearance and practice their roles/actions which are carefully choreographed before-hand to the minutest detail. In June 2015, an Indian Parliamentary delegation invited to the European Parliament in Brussels included a delegate who wore sports shoes to a meeting with the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.|$|E
