5|$|The report {{calculated}} the costs at 8.7 million kronor which corresponds in today's money to around $70 million (as of 2011), spent over a total construction schedule of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably {{lower than that}} of many of the recently built or modernised fortifications on the continent; Belgium had spent the equivalent of 62 million kronor on the fortified positions of Liège and Namur along the Meuse while Romania had spent 63 million kronor to strengthen the defence of Bucharest and 16 million kronor on fortifications along the Siret River. In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Riksdagin line with the plans of the Fortification Committeethat construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> Boden would be postponed to the next year. The plan gained support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, but when put to a joint vote of both chambers, the proposition passed. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, it was considered a great success for that question as well. During the last years of the century, the Riksdag's general attitude towards the army became more positive, most likely due to the increased Russification of Finland, increased tension in the Union between Sweden and Norway, and rumors that the Russian sawfilers that worked in Sweden also worked for the Okhrana, the secret Russian police.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in Australia traces the history of Australian Jews from the British {{settlement}} of Australia commencing in 1788. The first Jews came to Australia as convicts transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet that established the first European settlement on the continent, {{on the site of}} present-day Sydney. There were 97,335 Australians who identified themselves as Jewish in the 2011 census, but the actual number is estimated to be 112,000. (An answer to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> the census was optional.) The majority are Ashkenazi Jews, many of them refugees and Holocaust survivors who arrived during and after World War II, and their descendants.

25|$|The quorum for a Parliamentary sitting is {{one quarter}} {{of the total number of}} MPs, not {{including}} the Speaker. An MP begins a debate by moving a motion and delivering an opening speech explaining the reasons for the motion.

After that, the mover may exercise a right of reply. When the debate is closed, the Speaker puts <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> the motion to the House and calls for a vote. Voting is generally done verbally, and whether the motion is carried depends on the Speaker's personal assessment of whether more MPs have voted for than against the motion.

25|$|The Hatlestad Slide was a {{slide of}} mud and rock which {{occurred}} {{in the early morning}} of September 14, 2005 in a rural area in Bergen, Norway, as a result of heavy rainfall. The slide killed three people, wounded seven, and displaced many more, as it hit a row of residential houses in its path while the houses' occupants were asleep. The event is notable not only for the loss of life it caused, but also for how it altered Norwegian policies on environmentalism and housing construction, as well as emergency management. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> whether or not to end the treatment of fatally wounded Kristina Hjartåker, who was put on a ventilator until her death in February, sparked national debate, both on the case itself and on the ending of life-prolonging treatment in general.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> the {{replacement}} of Tessin as {{the governor of the}} crown prince placed the queen in conflict with the Riksdag. Tessin was replaced as governor of the crown prince with Carl Fredrik Scheffer, a candidate selected by the Riksdag, an appointment which was enforced even after the candidate had been refused by the queen. In 1755, the Riksdag presented their decision to rectify the loop holes in the constitution which Louisa Ulrika had used to claim that the King had greater constitutional power than the Riksdag had allowed him to practice. They stated that the loop holes in the constitution allowing for royal power would be removed, and that the monarch would no longer be allowed to refuse his signature: if he did so, a stamp with his name would be used. At the same time, a commission of the state begun to investigate political crimes. This resulted in a persecution of the followers of Louisa Ulrika within the Hovpartiet, one of whom, Eric Wrangel, fled to Norway to avoid arrest. Reportedly, this provocations triggered the queens plan of a coup d'état, known in history as Coup of 1756.|$|E

500|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk, people believed that the threatened invasion could come at almost any time. Churchill was at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory, telling Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time". German preparations would require {{at least a few}} weeks, but all defensive precautions were made with an extreme sense of urgency. In mid-1940, an invasion attempt could have occurred at any time, but some times were more likely than others: the phase of the moon, the tides and, most of all, the weather were considerations. The weather usually deteriorates significantly after September, but an October landing was not out of <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>On</b> 3 October, General Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "Still no invasion! I am beginning to think that the Germans may after all not attempt it. And yet! I have the horrid thought that he may still bring off some surprise on us." ...|$|E
500|$|The SFPA {{deferred}} to the Magnuson–Stevens Act for its {{definition of a}} fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or [...] "aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea {{in the performance of}} any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing." [...] Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. [...] "Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [...] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted {{at the time of the}} seizure," [...] he wrote. Since there was nothing in the record about that, he declined to decide <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> that grounds.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, the British Parliament {{authorized}} {{an additional}} four capital ships, holding out hope Germany {{would be willing}} to negotiate a treaty about battleship numbers. If no such solution could be found, an additional four ships would be laid down in 1910. Even this compromise solution meant (when taken together with some social reforms) raising taxes enough to prompt a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four [...] super-dreadnoughts, and augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period, Germany laid down only three ships, giving the United Kingdom a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve demonstrated by their construction programme led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. The Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, but talks foundered on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> whether British Commonwealth battlecruisers {{should be included in the}} count, as well as non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of ownership of Alsace-Lorraine.|$|E

500|$|Similar actions {{continued}} throughout 1941. The ZNDH flew many {{missions in}} support of Army troops in limited scale operations against the Partisans mostly over eastern and western Bosnia, as well as over {{other parts of the}} NDH. By September, the ZNDH introduced larger aircraft for bombing Partisan forces and territory. Two bombers, an Avia Fokker F.IX derived F.39 and a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 were available for operations and had the added advantage of being able to carry [...] bombs. They were extensively used for bombing villages and road communications. However it was soon established that the vintage biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft were ideally suited for missions against Partisan troop concentrations. Although they were outdated and certainly their use would be out of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>on</b> any other front, their performance and armament made them very dangerous for an ill-armed enemy. The Partisans were scattered in villages, forests and mountains and their positions could only be detected by a slow moving aircraft. Visual reconnaissance missions using hand-held cameras were also flown. Aerial reconnaissance supplied the army with vital data about Partisan movements and positions and about the situation in Partisan territory in general. This was all the more important because the army desperately lacked radio equipment of all kinds. Light aircraft were frequently used for liaison duties, particularly connecting the surrounding army garrisons and higher command. Often the Army requested one or two aircraft to be temporarily attached to particular army units to closely co-operate with ground troops.|$|E
