5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related {{the story of}} Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, {{even if he had}} to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia concurred {{with the}} majority, but wrote {{separately}} {{to note that}} Ideal's alleged 1962(c) injury was not within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action and so Ideal did not have standing <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
25|$|A complainant's right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> {{under the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not {{confined}} to charges as to which the EEOC has made a reasonable-cause finding, and the District Court's error in holding to the contrary was not harmless since the issues raised with respect to 703 (a) (1) were not identical to those with respect to 704 (a) and the dismissal of the former charge may have prejudiced respondent's efforts at trial.|$|E
5|$|The Seneca Nation {{could not}} have brought the lawsuit until 1845, when the New York {{legislature}} granted the nation the right <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> in courts of law and equity. The Seneca filed a petition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs on January 5, 1881, requesting restoration and possession of certain lands related to the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. This petition was ignored by the BIA.|$|R
50|$|Rockwell {{appealed the}} judgment, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed in {{relevant}} part, but remanded for {{a determination of}} whether the relator had satisfied a statutory requirement of disclosing information underlying his claims to the government prior <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>suit.</b> On remand, the district court found that the relator had not made an adequate disclosure, and appeal was taken. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the relator was an original source.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} {{dismissed}} on November 6, 2006 by federal judge Nancy Garlock Edmunds in Detroit, who cited the representatives' lack of standing <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> this <b>suit.</b>|$|R
25|$|Further, Arar filed a claim {{under the}} Torture Victims Protection Act, {{adopted by the}} United States Congress in 1992, which allows a victim of torture by an {{individual}} of a foreign government <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against that actor in a US court. Arar's claim under the act against Ashcroft and the INS directors is based upon their complicity in bringing about the torture he suffered. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.|$|E
25|$|In 1824 the City of New York {{attempted}} to assert a jurisdictional monopoly over the growing steam ferry service in New York Harbor in Gibbons v. Ogden. It was deemed {{by the court}} that interstate transport would be regulated by the federal government. This did not resolve the border issue. In 1830, New Jersey planned <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit,</b> but the matter was resolved with a compact between the states ratified by US Congress in 1834 which set the boundary line between them as {{the midpoint of the}} shared waterways. This was later confirmed by the US Supreme Court in a 1908 case which also expounded on the compact.|$|E
25|$|For {{his playing}} company, Farrant {{combined}} his Windsor {{children with the}} Children of the Chapel Royal, then directed by William Hunnis. On Farrant's death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant's widow, putting up a ₤100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sometime after Michaelmas Term (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly.|$|E
25|$|Oneida I and Oneida II {{opened the}} doors of the federal courts to dozens of {{high-profile}} land claims, especially in the former Thirteen Colonies, where tribal land continued to be purchased by the states without federal approval after the passage of the Constitution and the Nonintercourse Act. Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton (1975) held that (even unrecognized) tribes could sue the federal government to compel it <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> against the state governments to vindicate Indian land claims.|$|R

50|$|In {{the wake}} of similar decisions, in 1973 Congress passed {{specific}} legislation granting the FTC authority <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> in district courts to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent consummation of mergers pending action before the FTC, under a legal standard requiring likelihoods of success on the merits rather than a defeat of the agency proceeding. In addition, Congress passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which also created administrative clearance procedures having the effect of delaying consummation of mergers while agency evaluation of the competitive impact took place.|$|R

500|$|On April 10, 1906, the New York {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute enabling the Montauk tribe <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit,</b> [...] The act contained the following proviso: [...] "the {{question as to}} the existence of the Montauk Tribe of Indians shall be a question of law and fact to be determined by the court." [...] Judge Blackmar interpreted the act as [...] "providing that the act should not be construed as conferring tribal rights on any individuals, but that the question of the existence of the Montauk Tribe should be determined by the court." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the second}} hearing, on June 23, the Secretary took the {{position}} that the Nonintercourse Act did apply to the Maine (and the original states), but that it only applied to federally recognized tribes. The Secretary also argued that filing a lawsuit would damage relations between {{the federal government and the}} state of Maine. When Judge Gignoux pointed out that Maine's governor and entire Congressional delegation had called on the Secretary <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit,</b> U.S. Attorney for Maine Peter Mills (who was with Wittman at the counsel's table) declared that [...] "he, too, wanted the government to bring suit"causing laughter in the courtroom. After a recess, Judge Gignoux issued a preliminary order requiring the Secretary to file the lawsuit.|$|E

40|$|Irony {{is defined}} as “the use of words to express {{something}} other than and especially {{the opposite of the}} literal meaning. ” Though many other definitions of the word exist, in light of the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, this definition comes to mind. Read broadly, the decision strikes a blow to the ability of consumers <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> against companies, both inside and outside of arbitration. But that was not the intent behind the federal act that the Court relied upon to justify its decision...|$|R
50|$|In this case, Congress {{passed a}} statute {{permitting}} certain Native Americans <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suits</b> against the United States {{to determine the}} constitutionality of a law allocating tribal lands, and providing that Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the United States Treasury. Several cases were brought pursuant to this statute, including suits brought by David Muskrat and J. Henry Dick opposing the partition of Indian lands, and by another pair, William Brown and Levi B. Gritts, opposing a prohibition against the sale of certain Indian lands.|$|R
500|$|The Sherman Antitrust Act {{was enacted}} in 1890 {{to oppose the}} use of combinations, {{monopolies}} or cartels that harmed free and open trade. [...] It prohibited the restraint of trade. [...] The Clayton Antitrust Act was enacted in 1914 to address shortcomings discovered in the Sherman Act. [...] It specified the prohibited conduct, an enforcement scheme, and remedial measures. [...] The Clayton Act allows for private parties <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> for treble damages and for injunctive relief. [...] From 1922 (when Federal Baseball Club v. National League ruled that baseball was not considered interstate commerce) until the late 1950s, sporting events {{were considered to be}} exempt from both acts, until the Supreme Court decision in International Boxing Club v. United States.|$|E
500|$|On October 17, 2008, in Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 07A332, the United States Supreme Court {{overturned}} the 6th Circuit Decision requiring Brunner to provide lists of improperly registered voters to each county election board. [...] The ruling means that Brunner can instruct the 88 county boards of elections to ignore public record requests by the Ohio Republican Party made to challenge registrants with information mismatched between their registration and their driver's license or social security number. [...] The Republican Party {{claimed that the}} ruling {{was based on a}} technicality rather than the merits of the arguments. [...] Bennett said that [...] "The justices did not disagree with our argument that Jennifer Brunner has failed to comply with federal election law. [...] They merely said we don't have a right to bring a private challenge against her under this particular provision." [...] The McCain-Palin campaign said [...] "...the United States Supreme Court does not address violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Rather, the Court ruled that Congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> under the section of HAVA requiring voter registration verification through data-matching." [...] Since the ruling did not directly address the issues that the Republicans wanted determined, they filed a similar case in the Ohio Supreme Court. [...] However, they withdrew the case.|$|E
500|$|Their {{relationship}} {{began to}} break down over the question of railroad regulation. [...] The President in 1905 sought legislation to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set freight rates; Foraker considered the proposed law unconstitutional, and introduced a bill by which the railroad would set the rates, and if the ICC found they were excessive, it could ask the Attorney General <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit.</b> [...] Foraker spoke repeatedly against the administration-favored bill as it moved through the Senate, {{and was one of}} only three senators (and the only Republican) to oppose the resulting Hepburn Act on final Senate passage. [...] As the Ohio legislature had passed a resolution urging Foraker and Dick to vote for the bill, he faced anger at home; one newspaper wrote that Foraker had extinguished his chances of becoming president with his vote. [...] The following year, Foraker also broke with the administration on the question of statehood for Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory, feeling that the two territories should not be combined into one state unless a merger was approved in referenda. [...] Foraker's position prevailed in Congress; despite his stance, Roosevelt signed the resulting bill. [...] The two men also differed on issues of patronage, and on a series of treaties requiring Senate ratification that allowed for international agreements without the need for Senate approval. [...] Roosevelt wrote to a friend that Foraker seemed determine to fight him on every point, good or bad.|$|E
50|$|In its July 6, 2007 decision, the Circuit Court {{overturned}} Judge Taylor's {{ruling in}} a 2-1 vote. The majority declined {{to rule on}} {{the legality of the}} program, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the <b>suit.</b>|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{will address}} the {{inadequacy}} and injustice of the PLRA, specifically the “proper exhaustion” rule as expressed in Woodford v. Ngo. “Proper exhaustion” means that “a prisoner must complete the administrative review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>suit</b> in federal court. ” Failure to adhere to even the slightest procedural requirement is sufficient to warrant procedural default, i. e., a dismissal regardless of {{the merits of the}} underlying claim.

2500|$|Brandeis {{primarily}} {{objected to}} plaintiffs' standing. [...] His concurrence {{disagreed with the}} plurality's conclusion that the preferred stockholders could bring the action because they had already voiced their complaints to the corporation without success. Brandeis concluded that plaintiffs had no [...] "right to interfere" [...] in corporate governance under the substantive law, and because the stockholders could allege no injury which the substantive law recognized, they lacked standing <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the suit, {{parents of}} black public school {{children}} {{alleged that the}} Internal Revenue Service was not enforcing standards and procedures that would deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools.

40|$|When it {{enacted the}} Federal Tort Claims Act Congress waived the United States’ {{sovereign}} immunity for certain torts {{of the federal}} government. That waiver is subject to exclusions, exceptions, and limitations that may seem puzzling or counterintuitive. This essay explains the structure and operation of the Federal Tort Claims Act by comparing it to “a traversable bridge across the moat of sovereign immunity” (a metaphor used by Judge Max Rosenn {{in a slightly different}} context). The essay examines why Congress enacted the FTCA, the jurisdictional grant that allows some tort claims but not others, the pre-requisites <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>suit,</b> the exceptions Congress wrote into the FTCA, and other statutes that limit tort suits against the United States...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of the Government's {{inability}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> in a court after having unsuccessfully made a complaint with the ICC, the Court determined that forbidding judicial review in this manner was [...] "out of harmony with the general legislative pattern of administrative and judicial relationships." [...] The Court stated that the defendant's position on this matter was unacceptable. The opinion remarked that, by this argument, [...] "the order [...] is final and not reviewable by any court, even though entered arbitrarily, without substantial evidence, and in defiance of law." [...] Such a position was deemed inappropriate, and this argument was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Riverside County {{responded to}} this lawsuit by saying that McLaughlin had no legal {{standing}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> against the County because, based on City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), he failed {{to show that he}} was going to be subject to unconstitutional actions by the County, such as detention without probable cause. The County requested that the suit be dismissed. During this time, a second amended complaint was accepted (as individuals and class representatives), which added three more plaintiffs –Johnny E. James, Diana Ray Simon, and Michael Scott Hyde – who alleged that law enforcement officials arrested them without a warrant and were held without probable cause.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Gray {{extensively}} {{reviewed the}} facts of the case. Then Gray asserted the critical principle in the case: [...] "The sovereign is not liable to be sued in any judicial tribunal without its consent. The sovereign cannot hold property except by agents." [...] Like the majority, the dissenters also provided a lengthy history of the right of sovereign immunity, but underscoring the uniform inviolability of the right. Citing United States v. Clarke, 33 U.S. 436 (1834), the dissent reasserted that a lawsuit against the United States must be brought under the explicit authority of an act of Congress or the courts have no jurisdiction over it. Gray also reviewed the authority of private citizens <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>suit</b> in the United States Court of Claims.|$|E
