5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of paracetamol <b>tablets</b> has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500mg <b>tablets</b> in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg <b>tablets</b> in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 <b>tablets</b> for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 <b>tablets,</b> respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.|$|E

5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 <b>tablets</b> was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham Sewage Works in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham Sewage Works in 1885. The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton <b>tablets</b> were in such a different style to DeMorgan's, the replacement tablet was installed in the second row next to the three new <b>tablets</b> to police officers, rather than in the space left by the original.|$|E

Watts's wife, Mary Watts, took over the management of the project after Watts's death in 1904 and oversaw the installation of a further 35 memorial <b>tablets</b> in the following four years along with a small monument to Watts. Later she became disillusioned with the new tile manufacturer and, with her time and money increasingly occupied by the running of the Watts Gallery, she lost interest in the project, and only five further <b>tablets</b> were added during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost <b>tablets</b> from major brands, and the failures of other high-end <b>tablets</b> helped reduce the cost of parts, making <b>tablets</b> like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both <b>tablets</b> were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tablets</b> are {{arranged}} on the second, {{third and fourth}} of the five rows, with 24 <b>tablets</b> to William De Morgan's original design in the third, central, row, the 24 <b>tablets</b> added in 1908 directly below in the fourth row, and more recent additions above the original tiles in the second row. The first and fifth of the five rows remain empty. The first four <b>tablets,</b> designed and manufactured by DeMorgan and installed in 1900, were each made from two large custom-made tiles. Nine further De Morgan <b>tablets,</b> installed in 1902, were made using standard tiles to reduce costs, and were the last tiles whose installation was overseen by Watts. Eleven further DeMorgan <b>tablets,</b> along with T. H. Wren's memorial to Watts, were added in 1905, completing the central row of <b>tablets.</b> All 24 <b>tablets</b> of the 4th row, designed and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton tablet to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton <b>tablets</b> to three further police officers, and a replacement tablet with the correct details of the East Ham Sewage Works incident of 1895. A single tablet made by Fred Passenger in the original DeMorgan style, honouring schoolboy Herbert Maconoghu, was added in April 1931 {{to fill the gap}} in the centre row left by the removal of the original, incorrect tablet to the victims of the East Ham Sewage Works incident.
