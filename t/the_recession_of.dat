5|$|Thatcher's job {{approval}} rating fell to 23% by December 1980, lower than recorded for any previous Prime Minister. As <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1980s deepened, she increased taxes, despite concerns {{expressed in a}} March 1981 statement signed by 364leading economists.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this period}} brought {{economic}} expansion {{to the country}} as a whole, it was not <b>recession</b> proof. <b>The</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, and 1960 saw a drastic decline in GDP.|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} other parts of the Midlands, West Bromwich was hit badly by <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s and early 1980s, {{resulting}} in mass unemployment across the town, exceeding 20% in some districts.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s, both <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and {{adjustments}} in local economies {{to become more}} efficient in petroleum usage, controlled demand sufficiently for petroleum prices worldwide to return to more sustainable levels.|$|R
5|$|The Ontario government's normal {{process for}} highway {{construction}} {{was not possible}} given the financial constraints of <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1990s. The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology. Two firms bid on the project, with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{gradually}} opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign {{trade and investment}} and the privatisation of publicly owned industries, and the liberalisation of many sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate. The public debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 75.9 percent during <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> 2001, falling to an estimated 26.9 percent by 2013.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> {{the mid-1990s}} {{resulted}} in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised {{plans for the}} links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} environmental assessment (EA) for the extension, but had been announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|However, {{coal mining}} had {{disappeared}} from Tipton by the mid-20th century, {{and the town}} lost {{a large percentage of}} its factories during <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s, which contributed to a rise in unemployment and poverty in the Tipton, although living conditions continued to improve.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> 1921. Truman {{did not pay}} off {{the last of the}} debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so {{with the aid of a}} political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the 1930s {{was only}} halted by the {{increasing}} tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield {{were set to}} work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, {{but it was the}} heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E

5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s, {{downtown}} Albany {{was home}} to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. <b>The</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E
30|$|Before {{starting}} 13 {{the analysis}} of the different models that are considered in the methodology, it is convenient to estimate a base model, UC- 0, that does not include any mixture of normals, and follows the specification of Clark (1987). The obtained cycles capture <b>the</b> big <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> 1988 – 1989 and 1990 well, but henceforward the cycle presents a positive bias; for example during <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> 1998 and 2009 output is above its potential or trend level. On the other hand, the cycles are long and have a large amplitude 14, reaching a maximum deviation of 10  % in the mid- 1990 s.|$|R
25|$|The Bretton Woods {{system was}} {{challenged}} by several crises. As the economic post-war upswing proceeded, {{international trade and}} foreign exchange reserves rose, while the gold supply increased only marginally. In <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, the US had to convert vast amounts of gold, and the Bretton Woods system suffered increasing break downs due to US payment imbalances.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>recession</b> <b>of</b> 1969-1970 greatly {{affected}} Boeing. For {{the year}} and a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies (and later the 767 and A300/A310 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines, although it intends to retire them from service by 2018.|$|E

50|$|Wednesbury and Tipton are {{economic}} centres {{and historic}} towns with considerable suburbs although overshadowed {{in the service}} sector by nearby Birmingham. Since <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and early 1980s, West Bromwich West has suffered from an acute, stubbornly great minority of unemployment, and as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>recession</b> which began in 2008 unemployment peaked at 14.3%.
