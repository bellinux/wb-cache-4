5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E

The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> {{at a speed}} of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E

5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure.

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> {{out of which}} it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The blown-off {{outer layers}} of dying stars include heavy elements, {{which may be}} {{recycled}} during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets.

In particular the pickup ion focusing cone, which is an enhancement of interstellar pickup ions that is co-aligned with the velocity vector of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> neutral atoms (He+ and Ne+), forms due to the Sun's gravitational attraction and can be used to infer the inflow direction of <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> Opposite to <b>the</b> focusing cone, on the so-called upwind side of the Sun, an enhanced pickup ion flux {{in the form of a}} crescent is produced for atoms with low first ionization potentials (H+, O+, N+).|$|R
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{and planetary}} magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> {{and the strength}} of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium)</b> required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long.

Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
40|$|The {{observational}} {{constraints on}} the composition of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> dust are analyzed.

Stardust seems to dominate in <b>the</b> local diffuse <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium.</b> Inside molecular clouds, however, icy grain mantles are also important. The structural differences between crystalline and amorphous materials, which lead to differences in the optical properties, are discussed. The astrophysical consequences are briefly examined. The physical principles of grain surface chemistry are discussed and applied {{to the formation of}} molecular hydrogen and icy grain mantles inside dense molecular clouds. Transformation of these icy grain mantles into the organic refractory dust component observed in <b>the</b> diffuse <b>interstellar</b> <b>medium</b> requires ultraviolet sources inside molecular clouds as well as radical diffusion promoted by transient heating of the mantle. The latter process also returns a considerable fraction of the molecules in the grain mantle to the gas phase...|$|R

5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause.
