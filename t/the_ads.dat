5|$|In the lead-up to his {{official}} announcement, Huntsman gained attention for his campaign's unconventional TV ads, produced by veteran GOP strategist Fred Davis III, featuring a lone motocross rider traveling through rugged terrain as music {{plays in the}} background, while facts about Huntsman appear on the screen. <b>The</b> <b>ads</b> were widely parodied, including by the Utah Democratic Party and Rick Santorum's campaign.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ads</b> {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>ADS</b> or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, {{at the cost of}} mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>AD</b> 871 is a {{monolithic}} 12 -bit, 5 MSPS analog-to-digital converter with an on-chip, high performance track-and-hold amplifier and voltage reference. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> 871 uses a multistage differential pipelined architecture with error correction logic to provide 12 -bit accuracy at 5 MSPS data rates and guarantees no missing codes over the full operating temperature range. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> 871 is a redesigned variation of <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 872 12 -bit, 10 MSPS ADC, optimized for lower noise in applications requiring sampling rates of 5 MSPS or less. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> 871 is pin compatible with <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 872, allowing <b>the</b> parts {{to be used}} interchangeably as system requirements change. The low-noise input track-and-hold (T/H) of <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 871 is ideally suited for high-end imaging applications. In addition, the T/H’s high input impedance and fast settling characteristics allow <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> 871 to easily interface with multiplexed system...|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} what effects a five second countdown warning {{will have on}} consumer’s attitudes towards the advertisement depending on the main program content. This study builds upon several theoretical models concerning program-induced moods in relation to viewer’s judgment to commercial advertisements. Findings from two studies suggest that program-induced mood systematically influences attitude toward <b>the</b> inserted <b>ad</b> with (vs. without) a five-second countdown: for the negative-affect program, attitude toward <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was more positive when <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was preceded by the countdown than when <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was not preceded by the countdown. However, for the positive-affect program, attitude toward <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was more negative when <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was preceded by the countdown than when <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was not preceded by the countdown. A similar interaction was found with purchase intent...|$|R
50|$|On Friday June 5, 2009, “The Cure for iPhone Envy” {{billboard}} ad {{was put up}} on the BART exit {{outside the}} flagship San Francisco Apple Store. DoubleTwist's contract with BART’s ad agency specified that <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> would go up on Monday morning, the day of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote. However, <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> agency put <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> up early, on the Friday before. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> was put up, it was taken down by a BART employee. BART cited several advertising criteria violations as reasons for <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> being removed, including the original being too dark, and the subsequent redesign inappropriately having a white background. With Apple being a multimillion-dollar client of BART, it is widely suggested that Apple pressured BART into removing <b>the</b> <b>ad.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing <b>the</b> <b>ads,</b> and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

50|$|The Keynesian cross {{produces}} an equilibrium under several assumptions. First, <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> (blue) curve is positive. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> curve {{is assumed to}} be positive because an increase in national output should lead to an increase in disposable income and, thus, an increase in consumption, which makes up a portion of aggregate demand. Second, <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> curve is assumed to have a positive, vertical intercept. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> curve must have a positive, vertical intercept to cross the AD=Y curve. If the curves do not cross, there is no equilibrium and no equilibrium output can be determined. <b>The</b> <b>AD</b> curve will have a positive, vertical intercept {{as long as there is}} some aggregated demand—from consumer spending, investment, net exports, or government spending—even if there is no national output. The slope of <b>the</b> <b>AD</b> curve is steeper given a high multiplier value.|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} use of the landing page content in {{sponsored}} search ad selection. Specifically, we compare {{the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>ad’s</b> intrinsic content to augmenting <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> with <b>the</b> whole, or parts, of the landing page. We explore two types of extractive summarization techniques to select useful regions from the landing pages: out-of-context and in-context methods. Out-of-context methods select salient regions from the landing page by analyzing the content alone, without taking into account <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> associated with <b>the</b> landing page. In-context methods use <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> context (including its title, creative, and bid phrases) to help identify regions of the landing page that should be used by <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> selection engine. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective unsupervised algorithm to enrich <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> context to further improve <b>the</b> <b>ad</b> selection. Experimental evaluation confirms that the use of landing pages can significantly improve <b>the</b> quality of <b>ad</b> selection. We also find that our extractive summarization techniques reduce the size of landing pages substantially, while retaining or even improving <b>the</b> performance of <b>ad</b> retrieval over <b>the</b> method that utilize the entire landing page...|$|R
