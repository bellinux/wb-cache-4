40|$|Laser cutting {{technology}} is a non-conventional machining which being used widely in many industries. However, the application of this technology in textile industry is still new and yet to be explored. Indeed, nowadays many textile industries are preferred to cut the textile by using conventional way such as discs, band blade and reciprocating knives. As compared to traditional cutting methods the laser cutting offers several advantages such as fast cutting speed, reduced the time consumption, a non-contact cutting and no tool wear. Thus, using this technology would be more efficient and productive if the right method of laser cutting process is used to replace the conventional cutting methods. This research conducted, in conjunction to recognize the best machining condition {{and the effectiveness of}} CO 2 laser interaction with various types of <b>textiles</b> in <b>cutting</b> process. Through this study, two main experiments have been conducted using CO 2 laser to perform cutting process on a single and multiple layers of textiles. The textiles used in this study are plain cotton, chiffon, habutae silk, plain jessy and plain dull satin. Two main variable machining parameters have been chosen, the laser power (100 W – 500 W) and the cutting speed (60 mm/s – 600 mm/s). Variation of laser power and cutting speed in laser cutting process are very important parameters for best quality and efficiency of laser cutting method. The effect of varying the variable parameters have been investigated through the findings of the kerf width, side line length (SLL), circular diameter, percentage of overcut, depth of cut and the material removal rate (MRR). From the findings it is shown that, the usage of laser power and cutting speed influence the accuracy of the cutting process. For single layer the use of low power (100 W) and high cutting speed (600 mm/s) is the best choice. Moreover, cutting multiple layers of textile would require higher laser power and moderate cutting speed to avoid non full-through cutting. As a conclusion, the textile industries may manipulate this new technology in order to improve the productivity and increase quality of their products. Thus this CO 2 laser fabric cutting technique can produce high quality of production with a minimum of waste and total ease of use. Subject to a correct parameter selection and suitable intermediate material used in multiple layer of <b>textile</b> <b>cutting</b> process, may increase the productivity. In conclusion in order to achieve the overall improvements, the best machining condition of laser cutting need to be well determined to prevent any burn textile while conducting the cutting process...|$|R
40|$|<b>Textile</b> <b>cutting</b> is a {{standard}} pre-production stage in the apparel manufacturing process that has developed from a manual to a fully automated procedure in recent decades. Laser cutting technology has improved the efficiency and sustainability of cutting pattern markers on a large cutting scale, {{as well as the}} ability to cut intricate internal patterns and shapes on a smaller cutting scale. CO 2 laser technology has been adopted by industry and academia professionals at an exponential rate, but standard material testing for cutting and etching different textiles has been minimally documented. There were three primary objectives that comprise the purpose of this research which were to: (a) perform material testing to document and create a user manual that explains the parameters needed to laser cut and etch various textiles; (b) use Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory to examine “perceived attributes of an innovation” (2003, pp. 15 - 16), which are characteristics that help determine the rate of adoption, to survey apparel design students {{in order to determine the}} possible diffusion of laser cutting and the user manual in apparel design educational settings; and (c) apply knowledge from material testing to create a fashion ensemble that portrays the capabilities of laser <b>cutting</b> and etching <b>textiles</b> in apparel design. To meet the objectives, the researcher first tested how 127 textiles from the Basic Swatch Kit provided by Textile Fabric Consultants, Inc. responded to the laser cutter to develop a user manual for students, educators and industry professionals. Second, the researcher used Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation theory to analyze laser cutting and etching in the apparel industry. A sample of 26 undergraduate apparel design students participated in a survey in which the results demonstrated that laser cutting is viewed as a means to enhance their design projects and increase efficiency and precision. Third, the researcher created an experimental garment that incorporated both laser cutting and etching. Although the material testing of the various textiles had been completed, the creation of the experimental garment allowed the researcher to reveal a significant finding related to the impact of overall percentage of area that the raster textile design covers on the job time or efficiency in etching. Also, as a result of this research, a formula is proposed that will allow students, educators, and industry professionals the ability to use the information from the user manual and adjust the parametric percentages to that of their machine specifications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaser {{cutting of}} carbon fiber {{textiles}} has various advantages over conventional processes like ultrasonic knife cutting: It is wear free, no fibers are left uncut in the kerf, it {{is able to}} cut complex contours, and the cut edge is clearly defined. To ensure a complete cut under variable conditions, e. g. the thickness of the material, line energy has to be applied at a higher level than theoretically necessary to account for those variations. This energy is transilluminated through the kerf. In addition, not all laser energy is absorbed by the fibers but reflected and transmitted within the space between the fibers. Experiments were carried out to measure the percentage of laser power transilluminated through multi-layered carbon fiber <b>textiles</b> during laser <b>cutting</b> with maximum speed. To do so, blocks of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were placed underneath the samples and the mass of the sublimed material was measured. Depending on the angle of the fiber, between 9 % and 40 % of the laser power was transilluminated...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{utilisation}} of {{textile waste}} requires an accurate prediction {{of the quality}} of waste generated. Textile waste in Macedonia mainly consists of apparel cuttings. The aim of this research was to characterize the apparel cuttings waste, define the current state of apparel waste management and the potential barriers against introducing efficient waste management systems. Data was obtained via a structured questionnaire distributed to top managers in apparel manufacturing companies. The results indicated that almost all apparel manufacturers use landfills to dispose of their waste. The analysis showed that the waste stream consisted principally of woven fabrics, predominately cotton and cotton blends, with the presence of lycra. Bearing in mind the waste composition, the most appropriate end use for the pre-consumer waste produced is insulation materials. Considering that the industry consists of small and medium companies with limited resources, there is a low likelihood of individual investments in recycling equipment.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research details an investigation into processes employing laser technology to create design-led three-dimensional textiles. An analysis of historical and contemporary methods for making three-dimensional textiles categorises these as processes that construct a three-dimensional textile, processes that apply or remove material from an existing textile to generate three-dimensionality or processes that form an existing textile into a three-dimensional shape. Techniques used in these processes are a combination of joining, cutting, forming or embellishment. Laser processing is embedded in <b>textile</b> manufacturing for <b>cutting</b> and marking. This research develops three novel processes: 	laser-assisted template pleating which offers full design freedom and may be applied to both textile and non-textile materials. The language of origami is used to describe designs and inspire new design. 	laser pre-processing of cashmere cloth which facilitates surface patterning through laser interventions in the manufacturing cycle. 	laser sintering on textile substrates which applies additive manufacturing techniques to textiles for the generation of three-dimensional surface patterning and structures. A method is developed for determining optimum parameters for laser processing materials. It may be used by designers for parameter selection for processing new materials or parameter modification when working across systems...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{pathogenic}} {{basis of}} respiratory disorders associated with isocyanates are still obscure. One {{reason for this}} is the lack of good estimates of human exposure. In this study exposure was estimated by measurement of isocyanate metabolites in biological samples. METHODS: In a factory using isocyanate based polyurethane (PUR) glue, isocyanate concentrations in air were measured by liquid chromatography. Samples from 174 employees were analysed for metabolites of 4, 4 '-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in plasma (P-MDX) and urine (U-MDX). After hydrolysis, 4, 4 '-methylenedianiline was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The employees were screened for work related respiratory symptoms and tested for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies directed against isocyanate conjugated to human serum albumin. RESULTS: The time weighted isocyanate concentrations in air were low (MDI < 0. 2 - 7; hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) < 0. 1 - 0. 7; 2, 6 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) < 0. 1 microgram/m 3). All subjects had detectable P-MDX and U-MDX. There were significant associations between the estimates of exposure to thermal degradation products of an MDI based glue and P-MDX (range < or = 0. 10 - 5. 5 micrograms/l); and U-MDX (< or = 0. 04 - 5. 0 micrograms/g creatinine); in cases of heavy exposure. P-MDX and U-MDX were associated with each other (r = 0. 64; P = 0. 0001), work related symptoms (P-MDX: P = 0. 03; Mann-Whitney U test), and serum concentrations of MDI specific IgG antibodies (r = 0. 26; P = 0. 0007). Unexpectedly, high P-MDX and U-MDX concentrations were also encountered in workers <b>cutting</b> <b>textile</b> (P-MDX 2. 4 - 4. 5 micrograms/l; U-MDX 0. 81 - 3. 8 micrograms/g creatinine); the reason is still unknown. Equally unexpected, there were significant negative associations between P-MDX and liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly show the value of biomarkers for isocyanate exposure; in particular, P-MDX is useful. Further, these results show the risk connected with thermal degradation of PUR...|$|R
