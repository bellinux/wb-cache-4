He joined battle with Hadım Suleiman Pasha at Podul Înalt (or the High Bridge) near Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Before the battle, he had sent his buglers to hide behind the enemy fronts. When they suddenly sounded their horns, they caused such a panic among <b>the</b> <b>invaders</b> that they fled from the battlefield. Over the next three days, hundreds of Ottoman soldiers were massacred and the survivors retreated from Moldavia.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the extent to}} which an invader, Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda), has replaced a native, Gammarus duebeni celticus, over a 13 -year period in a European river system and some of the abiotic and biotic factors that could account for this. Between 1988 and 2001, 56 % of mixed-species sites had become invader-only sites, whereas no mixed sites had become native only again. The native dominated areas of higher dissolved oxygen and water quality, with the reciprocal true for <b>the</b> <b>invader.</b> Field transplant experiments revealed that native survivorship was lower in areas where it had been replaced than in areas where <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> does not yet occur. In invader-only areas, native survivorship was lower than that of <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> when kept separately and lowest when both species were kept together. We also observed predation of the native by <b>the</b> <b>invader.</b> Laboratory oxygen manipulation experiments revealed that at 30 % saturation, the native's survivorship was two thirds that of <b>the</b> <b>invader.</b> We conclude that decreasing water quality favours replacement of the native by <b>the</b> <b>invader.</b> 9 page(s...|$|R

5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to <b>the</b> <b>invaders</b> of their country, and <b>the</b> <b>invaders</b> saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E

40|$|Community {{diversity}} {{affects the}} survival of newly introduced species via resource competition. Competitive interactions can be modulated by resource availability and we hypothesized that this may alter biodiversity-invasion relationships. To study this, we assessed {{the growth of a}} bacterial invader, Ralstonia solanacearum, when introduced into communities comprised of one to five closely related resident species under different resource concentrations. <b>The</b> <b>invader</b> growth was then examined as a function of resident community richness, species composition and resource availability. We found that the relative density of <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> was reduced by increasing resident community richness and resource availability. Mechanistically, this could be explained by changes in the competitive interactions between the resident species and <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> along <b>the</b> resource availability gradient. At low resource availability, resident species with a high catabolic similarity with <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> efficiently reduced <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> relative density, while at high resource availability, fast-growing resident species became more important for <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> suppression. These results indicate that the relative importance of different resident community species can change dynamically along to resource availability gradient. Diverse communities could be thus more robust to invasions by providing a set of significant species that can take suppressive roles across different environments...|$|R

50|$|We {{can measure}} {{the effect that}} {{relative}} nonlinearity has on coexistence using an invasion analysis.

If <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> has a positive growth rate, then it cannot be excluded from the system.

We describe the use of <b>the</b> <b>Invader</b> assay {{in conjunction with the}} BACTEC MGIT 960 system that together provide an efficient procedure for clinical use. This assay discriminates single-base differences (e. g., genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms) under homogeneous and isothermal conditions and can measure directly on genomic DNA without prior target DNA amplification. To identify a wide variety of mycobacterial species, 20 Invader probes were designed to target the 16 S rRNA gene and the 16 S- 23 S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS- 1) region. To validate <b>the</b> <b>Invader</b> probes, we used 78 ATCC strains, and 607 clinical mycobacterial strains, which were identified by DNA sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and ITS- 1. <b>The</b> <b>Invader</b> assay could accurately identify and differentiate these strains according to target sequences. Moreover, it could detect and identify 116 (95. 1 %) of 122 positive liquid cultures from the BACTEC MGIT 960 system and did not react to 83 contaminated MGIT cultures.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model was developed which describes growth and competition of {{bacteria in the}} soil environment. In the model, soil was assumed to contain millions of pores of a few different size classes. An introduced bacterial strain, e. g. a genetically modified micro-organism (GEMMO), was assumed to distribute among the pores of the different size classes. This strain (<b>the</b> <b>invader)</b> was assumed {{to compete with the}} indigenous soil biota. Key aspect in this competition was the available pore space. The model predicted that generally <b>the</b> GEMMO <b>invader</b> bacteria ultimately did not become established in soil. Extinction of <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> was, however, often slow, and could take in the order of years. Very harsh conditions in soil were seen to enhance the pore space available for colonization and hence the probability that <b>the</b> <b>invader</b> was able to expel the indigenous microflora and become established.

He sent a detachment of ships deep into Lennox, through Loch Longdifferent versions of the saga number the force at forty and sixty shipsled by Magnús, Dubhghall, (Dubhghall's brother) Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí, Aonghus Mór, and Murchad. The saga states that the ships were dragged across land to Loch Lomondwhich {{indicates that}} <b>the</b> <b>invaders</b> would have beached their ships and made portage across the isthmus between the two lochs (between what are today the settlements of Arrochar and Tarbet). The saga vividly describes how <b>the</b> <b>invaders</b> wasted the well-inhabited islands of the loch and the dwellings surrounding the loch. The fact that Hákon tasked his Norse-Gaelic magnates with leading this foray likely indicates that their boats were lighter {{than those of the}} Norwegians, and thus easier to portage from one loch to another; it could also indicate that the undertaking was meant to test their faithfulness to the Norwegian cause.|$|E
