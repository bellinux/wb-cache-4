5|$|After 100 years, an {{estimated}} 500,000 students have taken {{courses at the}} Extension School. Fees were kept {{as low as possible}} to allow as many as possible to enroll, only 0.18% have ever earned a degree. Including certificate earners, 2.5% have graduated. Today more degrees are awarded each year than were awarded in the first 50 years combined. While <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> formal entrance exam such as the SAT, non-native English speakers must provide designated proof of English proficiency or receive a minimum score on the TOEFL, IELTS, or PTEA. Additionally, the preadmission Expository Writing E-25 course requires students to complete E-15 with a grade of B or higher in EXPO 15 or successfully complete the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} carving is unclear.

An elephant also appears in the arms of the Corbett family, local landowners before 1626.

25|$|In the United States <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party.

Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.|$|E

25|$|Young was {{instrumental}} in officially legalizing slavery in Utah Territory, teaching that the doctrine of slavery {{was connected to the}} priesthood ban. Slavery in Utah ended in 1862 when Congress abolished it. Blacks gained the right to vote in 1867, also through an act of Congress. Young and other church leaders were against interracial marriage. Utah's anti-miscegenation law was repealed in 1963. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> written church policy against interracial marriage. Church publications from 2003 still recommended that young people marry those with similar racial backgrounds. Black people in the LDS Church suffered exclusion and discrimination even after the 1978 revelation, and still feel the effects of racist attitudes.|$|E
25|$|The city of Liverpool is {{statistically}} {{the most successful}} football city in England with Everton and Liverpool winning a combined 27 league titles, and <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> season without one of either Everton or Liverpool competing in the top flight.

To date, Everton have won nine League Championships, five FA Cups and one European Cup Winners Cup. Thus, they have the only UEFA trophy that Liverpool never won.|$|E
