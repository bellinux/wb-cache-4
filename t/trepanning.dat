5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{treatments}} for malaria (and other diseases) included blood-letting, inducing vomiting, limb amputations and <b>trepanning.</b> Physicians and surgeons {{in the period}} used herbal medicines like Belladonna to bring about pain relief in afflicted patients.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had <b>trepanning</b> (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of <b>trepanning.</b> Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} neural networks {{is that the}} representations they learn are usually incomprehensible to humans. We have developed an algorithm, called <b>Trepan,</b> for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks. Given a trained network, <b>Trepan</b> produces a decision tree that approximates the concept represented by the network. In this article, we discuss the application of <b>Trepan</b> to a neural network trained on a noisy time series task: predicting the Dollar-Mark exchange rate. We present experiments that show that <b>Trepan</b> is able to extract a decision tree from this network that equals the network in terms of predictive accuracy, yet provides a comprehensible concept representation. Moreover, our experiments indicate that decision trees induced directly from the training data using conventional algorithms do not match the accuracy nor the comprehensibility of the tree extracted by <b>Trepan.</b> 1 Introduction Neural networks {{are perhaps the most}} wi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>TREPAN</b> is {{decision}} tree algorithm that utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs) {{in order to}} improve partitioning conditions when sample data is sparse. When sample sizes are limited during the tree-induction process, <b>TREPAN</b> relies on an ANN oracle in order to create artificial sample instances. The original <b>TREPAN</b> implementation was limited to ANNs that were designed to be classification models. In other words, <b>TREPAN</b> was incapable of building {{decision tree}}s from ANN models that were continuous in nature. Thus, the objective of this research was to modify the original implementation of <b>TREPAN</b> in order to develop and test decision trees derived from continuous-based ANN models. Though the modification were minor, they are significant because it provides researchers and practitioners an additional strategy to extract knowledge from a trained ANN regardless of its design. This research also explores how TEPAN's adjustable settings influence predictive performances based on a dataset's complexity and size. multi-class classification; decision trees; artificial neural networks; ANNs; TREPAN; C 4. 5; multilayer perceptron; MLP; generalised feed-forward; GFF; modular networks; genetic algorithms; techniques; strategies; continuous oracle; data analysis. ...|$|R

25|$|The oldest {{operation}} for which evidence exists is trepanation (also known as <b>trepanning,</b> trephination, trephining or burr hole from Greek τρύπανον and τρυπανισμός), {{in which a}} hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing {{the nature of the}} wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process. Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto-Neolithic and Neolithic times, in cave paintings, and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history (being described by ancient Greek writers such as Hippocrates). Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 had trepanation holes. Folke Henschen, a Swedish doctor and historian, asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the Dnieper River in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in Mesolithic times dated to approximately 12000 BCE. The remains suggest a belief that <b>trepanning</b> could cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and certain mental disorders.|$|E

He served against the First French Republic in the Flanders Campaign and on the Rhine. Severely wounded in 1799, he survived a <b>trepanning</b> {{operation}} and briefly retired from military service.

500|$|After {{the end of}} his {{seagoing}} naval career Rupert {{continued to}} be actively involved in both government and science, although he was increasingly removed from current politics. To the younger members of the court the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. Count Grammont described Rupert as [...] "brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when he ought to have been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern look, even when he wished to please; but, when he was out of humour, he was the true picture of reproof". Rupert's health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful <b>trepanning</b> treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.|$|E
500|$|Many of Rupert's inventions were military. After {{designing}} the Rupertinoe naval gun, Rupert erected a water-mill on Hackney Marshes for a revolutionary method of boring guns, however his secret died with him, and the enterprise failed. Rupert enjoyed other military problems, and took to manufacturing gun locks; he devised both a gun that fired multiple rounds at high speed, and a [...] "handgun with rotating barrels". He {{is credited with}} the invention of a form of gunpowder, which when demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1663 had a force of over ten times that of regular powder; a better method for using gunpowder in mining; and a torpedo. He also developed a form of grapeshot for use by artillery. Rupert also focussed on naval inventions: he devised a balancing mechanism to allow improved quadrant measurements at sea, and produced a diving engine for retrieving objects on the ocean floor. While recovering from his <b>trepanning</b> treatment Rupert set about inventing new surgical equipment to improve future operations.|$|E

The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having strong granite walls and a water clock mounted with a golden statue of man. Henry Yule noted that {{the name of the}} Byzantine negotiator [...] "Yenyo" [...] (the patrician John Pitzigaudes) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines. The New Book of Tang and Wenxian Tongkao described the land of Nubia (either the Kingdom of Kush or Aksum) as a desert south-west of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives had black skin and consumed Persian dates. In discussing the three main religions of Nubia (the Sudan), the Wenxian Tongkao mentions the Daqin religion there and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the Da shi (the Muslim Arabs). It also repeats the claim in the New Book of Tang about the Eastern Roman surgical practice of <b>trepanning</b> to remove parasites from the brain. The descriptions of Nubia and Horn of Africa in the Wenxian Tongkao were ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century AD), a Chinese travel writer whose text, preserved in the Tongdian of Du You, is perhaps the first Chinese source to describe Ethiopia (Laobosa), in addition to offering descriptions of Eritrea (Molin).|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of <b>trepanning</b> continues today due to belief in various pseudoscientific medical benefits.
