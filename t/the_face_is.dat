5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> exquisitely painful, {{is thought to be}} {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E

50|$|Corneille, Monin & Pleyers (2004) {{showed that}} {{familiarity}} of human <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> based on attractiveness. In this study the researchers showed their subjects pictures of <b>faces.</b> <b>The</b> subjects <b>were</b> {{asked to rate}} how familiar <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> or was not using visual cues. The visual cues were choosing {{a picture of a}} butterfly (attractive) when the subject thought <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> familiar, and choosing a picture of a rat (unattractive) when the subject did not find <b>the</b> <b>face</b> familiar. <b>The</b> result of this study was that the subjects were more familiar when <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> attractive regardless of prior exposure to the picture (or person) itself. This has been referred to as the warm glow effect (Monin 2003). The warm glow effect states that positive stimuli seem more familiar because of the positive emotions they evoke in us.|$|R

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch {{at the edge of the}} ear, and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
50|$|A {{dihedral}} angle (also called <b>the</b> <b>face</b> angle) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> internal angle at which two adjacent faces meet.

30|$|Changes in {{lighting}} conditions mainly lead {{to changes}} in the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image. After <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image <b>is</b> transformed, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image <b>are</b> obtained. In order to more accurately analyze the influence of illumination on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image <b>are</b> processed separately. The high-frequency component of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image represents detailed information such as texture and edge, and the high-frequency information of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image <b>is</b> mainly reflected in the position of the eyes, the nose, the lips, the mouth, the wrinkles of <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> skin color changes. When the brightness and contrast of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>are</b> changed, <b>the</b> low-frequency components of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> change and <b>the</b> high-frequency components change a little.
