5000|$|In {{the late}} 60s and early 70s, she {{along with her}} husband Jack Butler, served as a special {{projects}} officer for the Northwest Territories where they engaged and supported Inuit artists. <b>The</b> <b>Butlers</b> initiated a printmaking project, sewing projects and a shop. When <b>the</b> <b>Butlers</b> first arrived, they faced staunch skepticism about their programs. The local clothing factory had recently closed and many of the established printmakers had left. The community had already seen a series of unsuccessful government programs and arts and crafts officers. In Richard Crandall's book, Inuit Art: A History, he noted that the Inuit community, prior to <b>the</b> <b>Butler's</b> arrival, [...] "had spent thousands of hours on printmaking projects only to see them fail". Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>Butler's</b> printmaking project began in the craft centre and offered a wage of $1.25 to $2.00 per hour for those willing to study printmaking. By 1970, the Canadian Eskimo Arts Council approved the sale of a collection of 31 prints and requested a special exhibition for the spring and the program expanded adding two more positions. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>Butlers</b> founded <b>the</b> Sanavik Co-operative who mission was to [...] "foster and coordinate the art activities in the settlement, {{and to be able to}} contract for other community services." ...|$|R

5|$|City {{status in}} Ireland is decided by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island.
