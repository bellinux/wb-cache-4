50|$|There {{are more}} than 20 {{different}} Fragaria species worldwide. Numbers of other species have been proposed, {{some of which are}} now recognized as subspecies. Key to the classification of strawberry species is recognizing that they vary in the number of chromosomes. There are seven basic types of chromosomes that they all have in common. However, they exhibit different polyploidy. Some species are diploid, having two sets of the seven chromosomes (14 chromosomes <b>total).</b> <b>Others</b> are tetraploid (four sets, 28 chromosomes total), hexaploid (six sets, 42 chromosomes total), octoploid (eight sets, 56 chromosomes total), or decaploid (ten sets, 70 chromosomes total).|$|E

40|$|The four {{so-called}} ‘BRIC’ countries - Brazil (191 million), Russia (142 million), India (1, 136 million) and China (1, 331 million) – together {{account for}} 59. 7 % {{of the world}} population. Yet they account for only 5. 9 % of industry sponsored clinical trial sites globally – and only 22. 2 % of among emerging countries. However, a recent 4. 3 % drift has been noted from North America and Europe to emerging countries, with {{about a third of}} those 6, 500 sites located to BRIC. This study compares industry sponsored clinical trial activities among the four countries. Russia has more phase II-IV trials (n= 620) {{than any of the other}} three BRIC countries. Brazil and India both account for about 75 % of Russia’s total. China has fewer than 50 % (n= 268). The proportion of locally conducted trials – i. e. those conducted in one single country – is highest for China (49. 3 %), followed by Brazil (17. 6 %), India (9. 3 %) and Russia (5. 3 %). The number of active sites for multi-national industry sponsored trials is highest for Russia (n= 3, 364), followed by India (n= 2, 149), Brazil (n= 1, 988) and China (1, 044). The number of sites per active multi-national trial is highest for China (9. 4 sites per trial), followed by Russia (8. 4), India (7. 3 and Brazil (6. 9). The vast majority of multi-national trials are phase III – about 85 % for China and 75 % for the other three BRIC countries. Oncology (27. 2 %) and cardiovascular (24. 4 %) account for more than 50 % of multi-national trials in the four BRIC countries. Some sponsors are highly active in those countries, with over 700 active sites in <b>total.</b> <b>Others</b> are less active, with fewer than 400 active sites. Sites in Russia and China are both mostly located (56 - 57 %) in two major cities – namely Moscow (31. 2 %) and St. Petersburg (24. 9 %) in Russia, and Beijing (34. 3 %) and Shanghai (22. 4 %) in China. On the other hand, India has a more diversified geographic distribution of sites, with only 20. 5 % in the two most active cites of Bangalore and Mumbai. Clearly, the four BRIC countries hold enormous potential to become major players in international clinical research. A continuing drift of study sites from North America and Europe to emerging countries is anticipated, especially to the BRIC countries. A clear exception is China, due to its strict and conservative regulatory framework and shortage of experienced, accredited investigators/sites undermining its opportunity to significantly expand in the international clinical research playing field. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{purchase}} of non-audit services from incumbent auditors has generated considerable attention. Surprisingly, limited empirical evidence {{exists on the}} association of non-audit services with firm value. Focusing on services related to financial information system (FIS), {{we find that the}} market value of equity is greater for firms that purchase FIS-related services from their incumbent auditors relative to firms that do not. The levels of FIS fees are also positively related to firm value after controlling for <b>total</b> <b>other</b> fees, or <b>total</b> <b>other</b> non-audit fees. Hence, despite the negative perception associated with non-audit services, investors regard FIS-related services as value-adding activities. Copyright (c) The Authors.
