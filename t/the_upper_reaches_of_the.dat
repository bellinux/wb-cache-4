5|$|In the 1800s, {{settlement}} of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kettle Creek watershed centered on Germania, while the {{settlement of}} the lower reaches centered on the community of Leidy.

During this time, the Scootac Railway ran alongside <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek.|$|E
5|$|Steep and {{strewn with}} rapids, the Kootenay, despite being {{unsuitable}} for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, {{is considered an}} outstanding whitewater river.

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E

5|$|There is {{significant}} agricultural activity {{done in the}} lower reaches of the watershed of West Creek {{and there are also}} some residential areas.

Some of the most downstream parts of the watershed are urban.|$|E
5|$|Communities in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek include Central and Elk Grove. Lumbering was an industry in {{the watershed}} in the late 1800s. Fish species living in West Branch Fishing Creek include brown trout, brook trout, and sculpin. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek are designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There is significant benthic algae coverage in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Flash floods {{resulting}} from glacial lake outburst flooding in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, {{are a common}} occurrence in the Mo Chu and Pho Chu rivers, {{and in the past}} caused flooding and damage to the dzong, especially in 1957, 1960 and 1994. Fires and earthquakes have also further added to the problem. In 1996, flash floods in the Pho Chu river damaged the large stupa and caused several deaths.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the {{population}} density of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed of Little Catawissa Creek was 30 people per square kilometer. The population density {{in the middle}} reaches of the creek's watershed was 40 people per square kilometer and the density in the lower reaches of the watershed was 31 people per square kilometer. The creek is completely closed to public access between T435 and its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E
5|$|Maribojoc {{had five}} {{intricately}} carved Neo-Gothic retablos {{in the sanctuary}} and transepts. Striking features of the retablo were the presence of arches, crockets, Mudéjar stars and the profusion of carving. The whole retablo was probably completed in January 7, 1934 as a project of the Comité de Obras during the term of Father Quiterio Sarigumba (P.Q.S.) as seen on the inscription in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central retablo. An older retablo, built from 1616 to 1692, predated the church.|$|E

5|$|Nanticoke Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired, meaning that it fails to attain water quality standards. The causes of impairment are metals and pH and the probable source is abandoned mine drainage. The creek is also impacted by abandoned mine lands in its watershed. However, a total maximum daily load is not planned. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek do not experience any major pollution.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic Native Americans {{arrived in}} the lower reaches of Fishing Creek around 8000 BCE, and some were {{spending}} winters in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley by 3000 to 2000 BCE. In the past few centuries, the Fishing Creek area has been home to many industries, mills, and dams. It drains parts of five Pennsylvania counties: Columbia, Montour, Sullivan, Luzerne, and Lycoming. The creek's main tributaries include Hemlock Creek, Little Fishing Creek, Green Creek, Huntington Creek, West Branch Fishing Creek, and East Branch Fishing Creek.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created by}} plate {{tectonics}} about 35million {{years ago and}} subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods {{at the end of}} the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basin as well.|$|E

5|$|The artist Thomas Addison Richards {{created a}} graphite-on-wove-paper drawing of Big Wapwallopen Creek in 1852. The Crystal Spring Water Company was {{chartered}} on April 11, 1861.
