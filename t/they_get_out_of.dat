2500|$|Brigham Young, Smith's {{successor}} in the LDS Church, initially held {{views on}} capital punishment {{similar to those}} of Smith. On January 27, 1845, he spoke approvingly of Smith's toleration of [...] "corrupt men" [...] in Nauvoo who were guilty of murder and robbery, on the chance that they might repent and be baptized. On the other hand, on February 25, 1846, after the Saints had left Nauvoo, Young threatened adherents who had stolen wagon cover strings and rail timber with having their throats cut [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the settlements where his orders could be executed." [...] Later that year, Young gave orders that [...] "when a man is found to be a thief,...cut his throat & thro' him in the River." [...] Young also stated that decapitation of repeated sinners [...] "is the law of God and it shall be executed." [...] There are no documented instances, however, of such a sentence being carried out on the Mormon Trail.|$|E

60|$|December 10.--I {{corrected}} proofs and forwarded copy. Went {{out for an}} hour to Lady J.S. Home and dozed a little, half stupefied with a cold in my head--made up this Journal, however. Settled I {{would go}} to Abbotsford on the 24th from Arniston. Before that time I trust {{the business of the}} copyrights will be finally settled. If they can be had on anything like fair terms, they will give the greatest chance I can see of extricating my affairs. Cadell seems to be quite confident in the advantage of making the purchase upon almost any terms, and truly I am of his opinion.

60|$|Another mistake {{which really}} pious and good people commit, is, {{that they think}} the Holy Spirit of God to be merely, or little beside, certain {{pleasant}} frames, and feelings, and comfortable assurances, in their own minds. They {{do not know that}} these pleasant frames and feelings really depend principally on their own health: and, then, when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> health, or when their brain is overworked, and the pleasant feelings go, they are terrified and disheartened, and complain of spiritual dryness, and cry out that God's Spirit has deserted them, and are afraid that God is angry with them, or even that they have committed the unpardonable sin: not knowing that God is not a man that He should lie, nor a son of man that He should repent; that God is as near them in the darkness as in the light; that whatever their own health, or their own feelings may be, yet still in God they live, and move, and have their being; that to God's Spirit they owe all which raises them above the dumb animals; that nothing can separate them from the love of Him who promised that He would not leave us comfortless, but send to us His Holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us to the same place whither He has gone before.|$|E
60|$|I {{was once}} very much {{surprised}} at the behaviour {{of a couple of}} chakars during a thunderstorm. On a still sultry day in summer I was standing watching masses of black cloud coming rapidly over the sky, while a hundred yards from me stood the two birds also apparently watching the approaching storm with interest. Presently the edge of the cloud touched the sun, and a twilight gloom fell on the earth. The very moment the sun disappeared the birds rose up and soon began singing their long' resounding notes, though it was loudly thundering at the time, while vivid flashes of lightning lit the black cloud overhead at short intervals. I watched their flight and listened to their notes, till suddenly as they made a wide sweep upwards they disappeared in the cloud, and at the same moment their voices became muffled, and seemed to come from an immense distance. The cloud continued emitting sharp flashes of lightning, but the birds never reappeared, and after six or seven minutes once more their notes sounded loud and clear above the muttering thunder. I suppose they had passed through the cloud into the clear atmosphere above it, but I was extremely {{surprised at the}}ir fearlessness; for as a rule when soaring birds see a storm coming <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its way, flying before it or stooping to the earth to seek shelter of some kind, for most living things appear to have a wholesome dread of thunder and lightning.|$|E
60|$|Afternoon. Crossed the equator. In the {{distance}} {{it looked like}} a blue ribbon stretched across the ocean. Several passengers kodak'd it. We had no fool ceremonies, no fantastics, no horse play. All that sort of thing has gone out. In old times a sailor, dressed as Neptune, used to come in over the bows, with his suite, and lather up and shave everybody who was crossing the equator for the first time, and then cleanse these unfortunates by swinging them from the yard-arm and ducking them three times in the sea. This was considered funny. Nobody knows why. No, that is not true. We do know why. Such a thing could never be funny on land; no part of the old-time grotesque performances gotten up on shipboard to celebrate the passage of the line could ever be funny on shore--they would seem dreary and witless to shore people. But the shore people would change their minds about it at sea, on a long voyage. On such a voyage, with its eternal monotonies, people's intellects deteriorate; the owners of the intellects soon reach a point where they almost seem to prefer childish things to things of a maturer degree. One is often surprised at the juvenilities which grown people indulge in at sea, and the interest they take in them, and the consuming enjoyment <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. This is on long voyages only. The mind gradually becomes inert, dull, blunted; it loses its accustomed interest in intellectual things; nothing but horse-play can rouse it, nothing but wild and foolish grotesqueries can entertain it. On short voyages it makes no such exposure of itself; it hasn't time to slump down to this sorrowful level.|$|E
