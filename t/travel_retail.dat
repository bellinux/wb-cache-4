40|$|<b>Retail</b> <b>travel</b> {{comprises}} about {{a quarter}} of all trips made in Australian cities, however these trips gain far less attention in transport planning than do journeys to work/ school. Accessibility is a major factor affecting travel behaviour, but socio-demographic characteristics are also important given research on factors influencing mode-choice. This paper explores <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour in Brisbane, Australia, to identify differences in the influence of socioeconomic characteristics. The study uses the 2009 South East Queensland Travel Survey (SEQTS) 7 -day household travel survey conducted in Brisbane to illustrate the quantity and characteristics of <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> for different socioeconomic groups. The sample data has been divided into groups using cluster analysis techniques, which help inductively identifying meaningful subgroups (Hair et al., 1995). The data is analysed to show the major travel characteristics including: trip frequency; trip complexity; destination choice; and the mode share for each subgroup, allowing for comparative analysis. The results show that <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> is the most unsustainable travel in terms of the proportion of car trips involved. Walking and public transport accounts for very few trips, but the number of these trips are subject to variations based on accessibility, type of trip, day of the week and socio-demographic characteristics. Shopping centres and supermarkets capture almost 50 percent of all shopping trips suggesting special attention on them is needed in terms of their function and location in the city. Low socioeconomic groups travel more frequently by walking and public transport to retail destinations. Young adults and families make significant numbers of trips to major shopping malls. This research underlines the role that retail form, urban form and socioeconomic characteristics play in determining <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour. The results highlight notable differences in <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> by subgroup. The implications are that interventions seeking to encourage sustainable <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour, including spatial interventions and social marketing programs, should be carefully crafted to respond to these behaviours.

40|$|In {{the travel}} industry, sales {{executives}} {{are often used}} as {{the main source of}} disseminating information and assisting the <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> agent. The suppliers or principals within the travel industry, have, in recent years, become very particular as to which agencies they allow their sales executives to call. Significantly, some suppliers are now taking the view that if they are not supported through sales, they will not support firms through sales calls. To this end, some suppliers are choosing to simply refuse to distribute brochures to retail agencies that do not sell their products. The impact of these changes in the modus operandi of major suppliers for sales executives has, in more recent times, been further exacerbated by the advent of new technologies, evolving modes of packaging of travel products and changing information distribution channels. As such, the career prospects of sales executives in the travel industry has become highly unstable. The aim of the research, then, was to investigate the viability of the sales executive 'on the road' when there are, today, alternative means available of disseminating information and assisting <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> agents. Specific research objectives were to identify the areas where electronic communication may be used or is preferred by the <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> agents, identify the area/agencies which prefer sales executives to call on them as opposed to receiving information via electronic means, and to identify the required role of the sales executive within the <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> field. Whilst the presentation will focus on the specific findings of the research proper it will, importantly, also seek to identify the importance of the research to the travel industry. As such, some discussion of how the travel suppliers might relate more effectively to the <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> industry needs is paramount. The presentationwill also offer insight into how travel suppliers might build a better working relationship with <b>retail</b> <b>travel</b> agents...|$|R
