5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the ball on the nine-yard line.

But as the Hokies had done before them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech downed Texas' {{subsequent}} kickoff in its {{end zone}} for a touchback, and the Hokies attempted {{to answer the}} Texas score starting at the Tech 20-yard line. During the first play after the kickoff, Texas and Tech both committed penalties. After the penalties, Tech had a first down at its 27-yard line. After the penalties, running back Ken Oxendine attempted to run up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> but had the ball knocked loose by defender Tony Brackens.

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 41-yard line and used the good field position to its advantage. After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball with 41seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones rushed up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for another 12yards.

5|$|Following {{the kick}} {{and a short}} return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, {{seemingly}} in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss.

After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down with an option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown.

5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of a yard. Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after a gain of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> On the next play, Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense.

5|$|One of Mickal's {{most notable}} games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two {{touchdown}} passes, {{the first one}} a 32-yarder {{to tie the game}} at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass down <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Clemson in {{possession}} of the ball and starting a drive at its 20-yard line following a touchback. On the first play of the drive, Simmons threw an interception to Virginia Tech defender Willie Pile at the 50-yard line. Following the turnover, the Hokies continued running out the clock with rushing plays up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> A short gain by Suggs {{was followed by a}} five-yard offsides penalty against Clemson, which advanced the Hokies to the Clemson 45-yard line. Ferguson then gained a first down on a run to the 32-yard line. On first down, Vick was slightly injured after attempting to pitch the ball forward. He left the game and was replaced by backup quarterback Dave Meyer. Tech advanced the ball on short runs, setting up fourth down and seven. Tech coach Frank Beamer called a time out, allowing Vick to re-enter the game. The fourth-down play was an incomplete pass, and Tech turned the ball over on downs with 11:49 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|The team {{representing}} Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics was Mitchell Allan (halfpipe), Torah Bright (halfpipe), Andrew Burton (halfpipe), Holly Crawford (halfpipe), Damon Hayler (snowboard cross), Ben Mates (halfpipe), Emanuel Oppliger (parallel giant slalom), Johanna Shaw (parallel giant slalom) and Emily Thomas (snowboard cross). Bright came fifth, and Hayler came seventh, and {{the pair}} {{were the only}} Australians—apart from Oppliger (15th)—to finish in {{the top half of}} their respective events. In 2010, Bright returned and won gold. After falling in her first run in the final—only the highest of the two runs is counted—she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase, and produced the top-score, which the others could not match. Crawford came eighth in the final. Australia's two male competitors Mates and Scott James finished in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and missed the finals. In the snowboard cross, Hayler came tenth, while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial, but crashed {{in the first round of}} racing, while the sole female racer Stephanie Hickey finished near bottom. Shaw was again Australia's sole slalom racer, and ended in the bottom half.|$|E
5|$|Vandoorne {{remained}} with his intended strategy {{and led the}} field back up to speed at the lap-nine restart, ahead of Haryanto and Leal. He fended off an attempted overtake by Haryanto heading into the first corner, while Leal fell to fifth after he was passed by Matsushita and Visoiu. While in traffic, Lynn attempted to pass Rossi heading into the first turn, but made contact with the rear-end {{of his car and}} sustained front wing damage. Rossi pushed hard and moved ahead of Amberg by the twelfth lap. He caught up to Stanaway and quickly overtook him, and passed Berthon with the use of DRS two laps later. Rossi made further use of the system to get ahead of de Jong and Markelov. It allowed him to build a large gap to Lynn who was struggling. Rossi overtook Leal to move into fifth on lap 15, and the drivers who were running in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> made their mandatory tyre pit stops. Evans overtook Lynn driving into turn one on the 18th lap. Lynn reported that his car had tyre degradation problems and dropped down the running order, while cars who conserved their tyres took advantage.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line. Tennessee resumed running out the clock via short runs up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> that kept the game clock ticking down. After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the 23-yard line, and Clemson went three and out after Simmons threw three incomplete passes.

Vick was again replaced by Meyer at the quarterback position, and running back Dwayne Ward ran up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for a short gain. Third-string running back Keith Burnell gained more yardage with a run up the middle, then Ward picked up a first down with a run up {{the left side of}} the field. During the play, Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, but the resulting yardage was still enough for a first down. Tech proceeded to run out the remaining seconds on the clock, and the Virginia Tech Hokies earned a 4120 victory.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E

In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E

5|$|The kickoff was fielded {{near the}} Florida State six-yard line and {{returned}} 16 {{yards to the}} State 22-yard line. The first {{play of the game}} was a long pass by quarterback Chris Rix, but the throw was not caught. On the second play, Rix was sacked for a loss of nine yards. A third-down pass was incomplete, and Florida State punted. Virginia Tech returned the kick into Florida State territory, and the Hokies' offense began Tech's first possession of the game at the State 48-yard line. The Hokies' first play was an 18-yard pass from quarterback Grant Noel to tight end Bob Slowikowski, long enough for a first down at the Florida State 29-yard line. From there, running back Kevin Jones gained 12 yards and a first down on a run up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Jones gained three yards on the next play, then Noel was sacked by the Seminoles for a loss of nine yards. On third down, Jones regained some of the lost yardage but was unable to pick up a first down. Facing fourth down, Tech sent in kicker Carter Warley to attempt a 36-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 10:56 remaining in the first quarter, Virginia Tech took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, the Cleveland Browns and the New York Yankees faced off in the AAFC {{championship}} game, this time on a cold December day at Yankee Stadium. The crowd of 61,879 was the largest ever to watch a professional football championship game. The Browns and Yankees had played to a 28–28 tie the previous month, but the championship game did not feature much scoring because of an icy field. The Browns scored a touchdown in the first quarter on a short run by Graham set up by a 51-yard run up <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> by Motley. New York scored a field goal in the second quarter, but Jones ran for another touchdown in the third, and the Browns won 14–3. The slippery field made longer passes dangerous, and Graham instead relied on shorter routes, ending the game with 14 completions and 112 passing yards. Motley was a key performer for the Browns, running for 109 yards on 13 carries, including his touchdown. The Browns' defense, meanwhile, kept Spec Sanders and New York's offense in check. New York had just 13 first downs in the game and 212 total yards. A stop by the defense in the second quarter as the Yankees reached the Browns' five-yard line forced New York to kick its lone field goal. Tommy Colella added an interception in the third quarter to stop another New York drive. Sanders had just 40 yards of rushing on 12 attempts and 89 yards of passing. Gillom's booming punts – his five kicks averaged 45 yards – also helped the Browns stop New York's dangerous return game. The Yankees had a 4.7-yard punt return average.|$|E
