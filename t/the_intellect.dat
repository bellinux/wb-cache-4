The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines.

5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and <b>the</b> <b>intellect.</b> They use consensus under special conditions and rely on <b>the</b> <b>intellect</b> to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
5000|$|The Tayyibi {{system of}} ten Intellects is adopted from <b>the</b> ten <b>Intellects</b> of <b>the</b> Fatimid da’i Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani, in a {{departure}} from Fatimid cosmological Neoplatonism. However, in Kirmani’s system, <b>the</b> First <b>Intellect</b> emanates two beings: <b>the</b> Second <b>Intellect</b> and <b>the</b> Potential <b>Intellect,</b> which is primordial Matter and Form. <b>The</b> Second <b>Intellect</b> emanates eight other Intellects in successive emanation, while the nine spheres of the Aristotelian cosmos proceed from the activities of each of <b>the</b> <b>Intellects</b> upon <b>the</b> Potential <b>Intellect.</b> <b>The</b> Potential Intellect—an emanation of <b>the</b> First <b>Intellect</b> subordinate in rank to the Second Intellect—is responsible for the physical world.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> material <b>intellect</b> and <b>the</b> active <b>intellect</b> from Averroes’ perspective {{is an important}} and yet complicated part of his philosophy. His views on these issues are ambiguous since they are derived from the Aristotle’s theories which seem obscure in this regard. The aim {{of the present study}} is to discover Averroes’ final theory on the {{relationship between}} <b>the</b> material <b>intellect</b> and <b>the</b> active <b>intellect</b> and their connection to human soul. Reviewing various theories of Averroes on this issue, this study shows that despite ambiguity in his explanations, his final theory is that he believes these two intellects exist apart from human soul. Considering the relationship between <b>the</b> material <b>intellect</b> and <b>the</b> active <b>intellect,</b> he believes that in some aspects both of them are the same, yet they are different in some other aspects that is, regarding their acts, they are different because <b>the</b> active <b>intellect</b> acts as a creator of forms while <b>the</b> material <b>intellect</b> is just a receiver of the forms. Nevertheless, they are the same, since <b>the</b> material <b>intellect</b> achieves perfection through <b>the</b> active <b>intellect...</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{rests on}} the distinction between <b>the</b> passive <b>intellect</b> and <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect.</b> According to this interpretation, <b>the</b> passive <b>intellect</b> is a property of the body, while <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> is a substance distinct from the body. Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.

5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of <b>the</b> <b>intellect</b> as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers an}} interpretation of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s theory of cognition by considering two related questions: What is the role and function of the so-called “agent intellect,” {{and what is the}} causal structure of cognition? ^ <b>The</b> agent <b>intellect</b> is introduced in De Anima III 5 as a second <b>intellect,</b> additional to <b>the</b> potential <b>intellect.</b> <b>The</b> agent <b>intellect,</b> we are told, stands to <b>the</b> potential <b>intellect</b> as art to its material or light to colors. Beyond these suggestive metaphors, Aristotle fails to explain precisely how <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> causes thinking. ^ An adequate theory of <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> must explain why this second intellect is needed to complete the picture of cognition. The traditional interpretation is that <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> is required to abstract the intelligible forms from the images that result from sensation—a task of which the potential is deemed incapable in virtue of its putative passivity. The passivity attributed to this intellect reflects an understanding of Aristotelian sense-perception, which Aristotle claims is analogous to cognition, as a purely passive process. I argue that both the account of sense-perception and the interpretation of <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> to which it gives rise are mistaken. In my view, there is no role in the internal processes of cognition for which <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> is necessary. <b>The</b> agent <b>intellect</b> is to be identified with the prime mover and understood as a metaphysical principle upon which all intellection depends. ^ Chapter one introduces the Aristotelian noetic soul and marks out the philosophical options for interpreting <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect.</b> Chapter two puts into historical context the interpretive options classified in chapter one. I give here a critical analysis of five ancient and medieval commentators: Theophrastus, Alexander of Aphrodisias, the Alexandrian author of the De Intellectu, Themistius and Thomas Aquinas. Chapter three offers {{an interpretation of}} <b>the</b> potential <b>intellect.</b> Here I defend Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s insight that <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> accounts for human cognition in general without affecting <b>the</b> human <b>intellect</b> directly. Chapter five gives a theory of <b>the</b> agent <b>intellect</b> as a metaphysical principle. ...|$|R
50|$|Al-Farabi divides intellect {{into four}} categories: potential, actual, {{acquired}} and the Agent.
