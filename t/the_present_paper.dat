Due {{to the relatively}} high possible temperature variations in beams we have developed the mathematical model where fundamental thermomechanical properties of state are functions of temperature such as modulus of elasticity, Poisson number, linear expansion coefficient, shear modulus and some other important thermodynamic properties of state. The detailed analysis shows, that also small changes of temperature cause significant changes of natural frequencies for beams. The comparison between our analytical model and experimental data shows good agreement.
