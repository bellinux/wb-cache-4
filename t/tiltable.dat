50|$|Sisu KB-112 is a three-axle lorry {{made by the}} Finnish {{heavy vehicle}} {{manufacturer}} Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) in 1962-1969. The vehicle was equipped with a technically advanced <b>tiltable</b> cabin. Its two-axle variant is KB-117 which was produced 1964-1969. Both versions were only produced small numbers.|$|E
50|$|The R-series {{belongs to}} the producer's heavy duty Jyry range and {{it is based on}} the {{preceding}} models. Similar to the previous range, the R-type is equipped with a <b>tiltable,</b> single piece bonnet made from reinforced plastic as standard. Use of plastic is further increased in various cabin parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{preceding}} {{models of}} M-series were three-axle KB-112 and two-axle KB-117 which featured a serial produced hydraulically <b>tiltable</b> cabin first in Europe.

50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{has indicated}} {{the time to}} acquire auto focus as 0.07 seconds. The electronic OLED viewfinder has a resolution of 2.36 million dots and, as in the predecessor, is <b>tiltable.</b> The 3″ OLED touchscreen rear display is fully articulated and can display 1.04 million dots. The camera is splash proof.|$|E
50|$|Angular {{dependence}} of detection {{can be achieved}} by using a movable detector, or more practically by separating the surface barrier detector into many independent cells which can be measured independently, covering some range of angles around direct (180 degrees) back-scattering. Angular {{dependence of}} the incident beam is controlled by using a <b>tiltable</b> sample stage.|$|E

50|$|In 1961 SAT {{produced}} the ballast tractor K-50SS {{which is still}} the largest automobile ever built in Nordic countries. The first European serial built lorry with a hydraulically <b>tiltable</b> forward control cabin, Sisu KB-112, was introduced in 1962. The 1965 introduced Sisu K-148 featured bonnet and wings produced from reinforced plastic. Due to lower costs and better durability the solution was soon applied on the whole conventional cabin model range.|$|E

5000|$|The Samsung NX300M is a rangefinder-styled digital mirrorless camera {{announced}} by Samsung on January 3, 2013. It {{was the first}} consumer product based on the Tizen operating system. Its other upgrades over the NX300 model include increased rotation range for the <b>tiltable</b> display, allowing it {{to be put into}} a 180 degree [...] "selfie" [...] position. It was initially on sale in South Korea only, and its containing the Tizen operating system was not revealed until almost a month later.|$|E
50|$|A mono {{tiltrotor}} aircraft uses a <b>tiltable</b> rotating propeller, or coaxial proprotor, for {{lift and}} propulsion. For vertical flight the proprotor is angled to direct its thrust downwards, providing lift. In {{this mode of}} operation the craft is essentially identical to a helicopter. As the craft gains speed, the coaxial proprotor is slowly tilted forward, with the blades eventually becoming perpendicular to the ground. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the wing's greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve its high speed. In this mode, the craft is essentially a turboprop aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Acousto-optic {{modulators}} {{are much}} faster than typical mechanical devices such as <b>tiltable</b> mirrors. The time it takes an AOM to shift the exiting beam in is roughly limited to the transit time of the sound wave across the beam (typically 5 to 100 ns). This is fast enough to create active modelocking in an ultrafast laser. When faster control is necessary electro-optic modulators are used. However, these require very high voltages (e.g. 1...10 kV), whereas AOMs offer more deflection range, simple design, and low power consumption (less than 3 W).|$|E
50|$|The Cube - A {{team captain}} inserts a ball inside a large, <b>tiltable</b> Perspex cube. Four contestants guide a ball by tilting each {{corner of the}} cube. At various points within three layers are holes to drop the ball into, and at the bottom is a Hit Zone (20 points for the first two, 40 points for any others) and a Miss Zone (lose 10 points). There is also a chute {{that will give you}} a direct Hit. The game music is the same music for The Tensioner.|$|E
50|$|In 2016 Canon {{announced}} the Canon PowerShot G7 X mark II which follows the original G7 X. It retains the same sensor and lens as its predecessor. The main improvement {{is the new}} DIGIC 7 Processor. In fact the G7 X mark II is the first Canon camera to use this new chip. This new chip leads to better AF performance, object tracking, reduced ISO noise and higher speed burst shooting. Some other improvements are that the screen can now flip both up and down, a new grip, <b>tiltable</b> flash, auto functionality for the ND filter, battery charging over USB, and a new timelapse mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{open wagon}} with {{drop-down}} sides of Class A1 {{were based on}} the Prussian truck, built to Sheet II d3. Just under 50,000 A1s were built from 1910, both with and without brakeman's cabs. They had a loading capacity of 18.4 m³, a maximum load of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. The wooden walls of the <b>tiltable</b> wagon were 1,000 mm high, the door width was 1,500 mm, the loading length 6,720 mm and the loading width 2,734 mm. The wheelbase for vehicles, with and without hand brakes was uniformly 4,000 mm, with a length over buffers of 8,800 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The E-PL3 {{lacks the}} E-P3 {{capacitive}} touchscreen for creative camera control, and the E-P3 OLED type display {{that is supposed}} to vastly improve performance in sunny conditions, and off-angle viewing. Instead, the E-PL3 has a <b>tiltable</b> LCD, which allows easy above the head, waist level, or low off the ground viewing. The E-PL3 continues with the proprietary Accessory Port, a power and communication port, which allows the use of various accessories, such as an external stereo microphone for HD video recording, LED macro lights, and a bluetooth communications adapter. The accessory port continues to be compatible with the high resolution, optional hotshoe mounted VF-2 electronic viewfinder (EVF).|$|E
50|$|The E-PL5 has a {{capacitive}} touchscreen similar to E-P3 and OM-D E-M5 for creative camera control, but lacks an OLED type display {{that is supposed}} to vastly improve performance in sunny conditions, and off-angle viewing. Instead, the E-PL5 has a <b>tiltable</b> LCD, which allows easy above the head, waist level, low off the ground viewing and self-portraits, but no viewfinder. With no built-in flash, but sold with clip-on flash, the E-PL5 continues with the proprietary Accessory Port, a power and communication port, which allows the use of various accessories, such as other external flash, an external stereo microphone for HD video recording, LED macro lights, and a bluetooth communications adapter. The accessory port is compatible with the optional hotshoe mounted VF-2, VF-3 and VF-4 electronic viewfinders (EVF).|$|E
50|$|Creating of a short-nosed {{vehicle was}} not a such big step to SAT as the company had {{previously}} designed for the state KB-102/KB-107 models with a fixed cabin over engine. As a small manufacturer, SAT listened carefully the signals from its customers. The company set a new project with an urgent status for a modern, state-of-art COE model. The main issue was to ensure an {{easy access to the}} engine, enabling maintenance and repairs. The work was started from a blank paper. Finally the cabin got a simple design but it was furnished with a proper bed placed behind the seats. The service problem was solved by a <b>tiltable</b> cabin. Cabin ergonomy, primarily the driving position and instrument panel layout, was developed based on interviews of more than one hundred lorry drivers.|$|E
5000|$|Like Sony's APS-c flagship, α77, the α99 has {{the ability}} to record Full HD 1080 video with up to 60p frame rate. In markets outside China, this camera also has {{built-in}} GPS that allows recording of position information into the photo. The α99 also uses a three-way <b>tiltable</b> LCD, as used on α77, this feature allows the photographer to view the LCD from any angle. Alongside the lens mount Sony has replaced the traditional autofocus mode selection dial with a [...] "Silent Multi-Controller" [...] which is a customizable dial with silent detents and a central button used for confirmation. The dial's function can be brought up with a press of the central button and then changed using the dial silently during movie or still recording. The dial's functions can also be changed on the fly by long-pressing the button and then selecting whichever function is desired.|$|E
