5|$|This {{rapid rise}} {{in the power of}} Macedon was in part due to Philip's {{exceptional}} military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also in part due to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.|$|E

500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} excess {{pressure}} on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. [...] In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or intervertebral discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, {{studies have found that}} earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. [...] Sometimes a patient has <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.|$|E

[...] There is no record of their joining forces or sharing information. [...] It seems likely they met up but we don't know if it was preordained. If Phips was unwittingly being used as a decoy to distract the other treasure hunters away from Stanley, it might have dawned on him at this time. Soon after Phips visited the north coast of Hispaniola and slowly cruised north exploring the banks where Stanley had been diligently searching for over a year. The decisiveness with which Phips later returned and quickly located the treasure suggests {{that he was able to}} gather valuable knowledge and begin to formulate a clear plan, though he would have to wait two years to bring it to fruition.|$|E

On Metacritic, {{the film has}} a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Ken Eisner (Variety) gave the film a positive review. The reviewer referred to the film as a [...] "truly shocking horror film" [...] that was [...] "made even more disturbing by its haunting beauty". Geoffrey Macnab, writing in Sight and Sound, referred to the film as a [...] "slow-burning but ultimately devastating horror pic" [...] and wrote that [...] "it's a virtuoso piece of film-making with much more subtlety and depth than Miike's other films". The Hollywood Reporter Frank Scheck described the film as [...] "one of the most audacious, iconoclastic horror films in recent years". Mark Schilling (The Japan Times) praised Shiina and Ishibashi's acting, but noted that [...] "among the film's few irritants is a smarmy, snarly bad guy turn by Renji Ishibashi as Asami's wheelchair-bound ballet instructor. He {{is a reminder of}} where <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Miike films have headed – straight for the video racks".

500|$|Peters {{was born}} in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He began riding at age seven, and {{competing}} in weekend dressage shows. By 15, he was competing outside of Germany, at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark. He received his first horse, Udon, at age 16 as a gift from his father; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1984, he spent the summer training in San Diego, California, before returning to Germany to perform his army service. In 1985, {{he returned to the}} United States with Udon. In 1991, he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor, Lila Kommerstad, who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters' Arroyo Del Mar training barn. Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992, saying, [...] "The whole idea of being so patriotic, of feeling so close to one's country makes a difference. There are not <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> countries where the people are so patriotic. I really enjoy this about America." [...] Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife, Shannon. Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012, around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders. Outside of his competition and training schedule, he teaches in around 30 training seminars each year.

500|$|Wishology {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Eileen Cruz of Toon Zone mainly praised it. Specifically, {{she observes}} that it [...] "manages to remain largely fresh {{the entire time}} for an animated comedy episode over two hours long". Aaron Bynum of The Animation Insider, however, gave a more negative review. He suggested it was only [...] "moderately entertaining", saying it is [...] "just another over-exerted animated epic of an over-extended property." [...] Cruz commented positively on the show's usage of a mix of standard and computer animation; however, she noted the blend between special 3D objects and their surroundings was [...] "not perfect", though [...] "not distracting either". Bynum stated the animated trilogy's usage of computer animation was [...] "rather needless", and its cultural parodies were [...] "tired and forgettable". While he finds [...] "The Final Ending" [...] interesting {{enough to keep the}} viewer engaged, he also criticized the series as a whole. He said, [...] "it would appear that the cartoon is no longer an exclusive journey into one child's ever-changing imagination; now, it's just a fanciful what-if". Cruz praised the role of the band Kiss. She cannot think of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> bands that [...] "could exist in such a universe with such an exaggerated reality". However, she criticized the voice portrayal of Turbo Thunder, finding it to be [...] "entirely unattractive" [...] and [...] "off-putting," [...] and thus [...] "it simply didn't work for me." [...] Bynum, however, had a more positive reaction to the character. He noted Turbo Thunder was [...] "hilariously pretentious and self-serving", and he [...] "ultimately makes the second chapter [...] a whole lot better by acting as a frenemy with similar goals." ...|$|E

Plusses for collectors of the 1965 model include decent performance with optional drivetrains, historical oddity, plush, bucket-seat interior, and its still low prices; while the Marlin's [...] "distinctive" [...] styling, rust issues, and slow appreciation in value are minuses.
