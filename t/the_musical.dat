5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of <b>the</b> <b>musical</b> to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with <b>the</b> <b>musical</b> and scoured {{the country for a}} suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. <b>The</b> <b>musical,</b> much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E
