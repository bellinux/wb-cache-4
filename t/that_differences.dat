5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's {{comments about the}} importance of IQ on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in methodology could explain the two men's differing opinions.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a similar}} overall appearance, A.hygrometricus {{is not related}} to the true earthstars of genus Geastrum, {{although}} historically, they have been taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in microscopic characteristics warranted {{the creation of a new}} genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A.hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique Astraeus species, including A.asiaticus and A.odoratus. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A.hygrometricus as inedible.|$|E
50|$|Deleuze proposes (citing Leibniz) <b>that</b> <b>difference</b> {{is better}} {{understood}} {{through the use}} of dx, the differential. A derivative, dy/dx, determines the structure of a curve while nonetheless existing just outside the curve itself; that is, by describing a virtual tangent (46). Deleuze argues <b>that</b> <b>difference</b> should fundamentally be the object of affirmation and not negation. As per Nietzsche, negation becomes secondary and epiphenomenal in relation to this primary force.|$|R

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

25|$|An {{understanding}} of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their {{role in shaping the}} individual.

This research suggests <b>that</b> <b>differences</b> exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E
