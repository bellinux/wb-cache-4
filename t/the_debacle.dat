5|$|An {{additional}} {{cause of}} delay, according to Professor Williams, was the long pause after <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength {{both of the}} opposing army and of Humaitá: they allowed López almost a year to rebuild his forces, devastated at the Battle of Tuyutí.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the Illinois Militia, mostly {{members of}} the Regular Army, {{attacked}} their behavior at <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> at Stillman' Run. They began {{to refer to the}} battle at Old Man's Creek as the Battle of Stillman's Run, because Stillman had apparently fled with the panicked militia.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> of The Road Back, Charles Rogers {{tried to}} get out of his {{contract}} with Whale; Whale refused. Rogers then assigned him to a string of B movies to run out his contractual obligation.

5|$|The {{fact that}} Indians allied to the British {{witnessed}} <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> first hand complicated future relations with them.

5|$|The {{product has}} since been studied {{as an example of}} a public {{relations}} disaster and an example of an internet hoax. Microsoft's public relations response to <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> is also considered to be one of the poorest in the company's history, given Microsoft's reputation for micro-managing news releases, interviews and promotional events.|$|E
5|$|The treaty as {{set down}} by Polybius {{makes no mention}} of an {{invasion}} of Italy by Philip, <b>the</b> <b>débâcle</b> at Sazan perhaps having soured Philip on such a venture — something which in any case Hannibal may not have desired.|$|E

5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions to {{forestall}} and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US government {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Malik desisted {{from further}} {{attempts}} to seize Iraq following <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> at Khazir, and instead focused on winning over disaffected tribal chieftains throughout the province. It {{was not until}} 690/91 that Abd al-Malik launched a major invasion of Iraq, personally leading an army whose command was largely staffed by the caliph's family, including Muhammad ibn Marwan, Khalid ibn Yazid and Abd Allah ibn Yazid. By then, many of Iraq's ashraf had accepted Umayyad sovereignty, and following the Umayyad victory in the Battle of Maskin, in which both Mus'ab and Ibn al-Ashtar were slain, Umayyad rule in Iraq was reestablished.|$|E

5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>debacle,</b> Reshef {{remained}} {{determined to}} seize the junction, giving the task to the division's reconnaissance battalion attached to his brigade. To achieve surprise, the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3:00 AM from the west, as the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks {{from the south and}} east. As the Israelis attacked, Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions, disrupting his battalion's assault. The Israelis sustained losses, but managed to retreat. Soon after, a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4:00 AM on October 16, but also withdrew after losing three tanks.|$|E
5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when {{a clash of}} outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged returned to their start lines, and {{the position of the}} two armies on Manhattan remained relatively unchanged for the next two months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a much needed boost to their morale after <b>the</b> <b>debâcle</b> of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E

5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched {{a battalion of}} the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem {{as well as a}} contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{returned}} to Boston in July 1778, {{motivated by the}} opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia. Now that the French fleet {{had come to the}} aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General John Sullivan of the Continental Army to lead an attack on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral d'Estaing abandoned the operation, after which Hancock's militia mostly deserted Sullivan's Continentals. Hancock suffered some criticism for <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Other {{institutions}} were also formed {{with the purpose}} of providing feedback and monitoring activities on the ground. To enhance the protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks, in August 1915, the legislative council passed the Reserve Force and Civil Guard Ordinance. This was the first Act passed in a British colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between the ages 15 to 55 who were not in the armed forces, volunteers, or police. Additionally, a Reserve force in the Volunteer Corps was created for fit men over the age 40. From the slew of new initiatives enforced, {{it was clear that the}} British had taken <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> of the mutiny as a serious lesson to learn from and to prevent from happening again.|$|E

5|$|Outraged by {{news of the}} defeat, Washington urged Congress {{to raise}} an army capable of {{conducting}} a successful offense against the Indian confederacy, which it did in March 1792establishing additional Army regiments (the Legion of the United States), adding three-year enlistments, and increasing military pay. The following month the House of Representatives conducted investigative hearings into <b>the</b> <b>debacle.</b> This was the first Special Congressional investigation under the federal Constitution. Afterward, Congress passed two Militia Acts: the first empowered the president to call out the militias of the several states; the second required that every free able-bodied white male citizen of the various states, {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45, enroll in the militia of the state in which they reside.|$|E
5|$|The England {{side was}} {{thoroughly}} shaken-up following <b>the</b> <b>debacle</b> in the Third Test at Old Trafford. The selectors {{tried to turn}} things around with seven new faces in the team, the most extensive change of an England XI during a Test series since seven players were changed for the 1921 Ashes Tests against Australia at Lord's and Headingley (when only JWHT Douglas, Ciss Parkin, Lionel Tennyson and Frank Woolley were retained, and Tennyson replaced Douglas as captain). As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, the selectors also dropped Paul Downton, Martyn Moxon, Mike Gatting, David Capel, Phil Defreitas and John Childs in favour of Derek Pringle, Neil Foster, Bill Athey, and Jack Richards, with Tim Curtis and Robin Smith making their Test debuts. For the West Indies, both Greenidge and Richardson sat the match out, injured: Haynes returned, and a debut was handed to Keith Arthurton. Jeff Dujon was promoted up the batting order as a makeshift opener.|$|E
5|$|The French {{reaction}} to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could work against French interests. <b>The</b> <b>debacle</b> of the Battle of Trafalgar had {{made it clear that}} the projected invasion had to be scrapped. The Dutch now began to clamor for economies in the form of the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the Peace of Pressburg and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother Louis Bonaparte.|$|E
