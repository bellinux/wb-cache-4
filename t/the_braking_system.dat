5|$|<b>The</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes at {{the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, {{a report}} with photos {{surfaced}} that <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> on the launch {{side of the}} track may have been damaged, causing the ride to close indefinitely. Cedar Point did not acknowledge the incident and stated the closure was for maintenance reasons.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> of the trains. During 2009, {{there were}} 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board {{found that the}} metro had conducted insufficient testing of <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
5000|$|Foundation {{components}} are the brake-assembly components at {{the wheels of}} a vehicle, named for forming {{the basis of the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> These mechanical parts contained around the wheels are controlled by <b>the</b> air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2010, {{the launch}} system failed to power a train {{over the first}} hill, letting it roll back into the station and collide with another, causing minor {{injuries}} to ten people. An investigation discovered that paint on the brake fins had impaired <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The investigation also revealed that Knott's had no testing procedure for a failed launch and roll back.|$|E
5000|$|Independent {{air brakes}} leaked off: With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the air compressor no longer supplied air to <b>the</b> air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> As air leaked from <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> <b>the</b> main air reservoirs were slowly depleted, gradually reducing {{the effectiveness of}} <b>the</b> locomotive air <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep {{aid system}} {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> {{adapted from}} the DS, employs disc brakes at all four corners (the DS has drums at the rear), with the front brakes being inboard, and cooled via large ducts on the front {{underside}} of the car. The hydraulic braking pressure front to rear balance is self-adjusting according to the weight {{in the rear of}} the car, so on hard braking the entire car lowers evenly.|$|E
25|$|Simulation testing {{determined}} that pilot error {{was the cause}} as a braking force {{was found to have}} been applied by the chief pilot during takeoff. Using data from the flight recorder, it was determined the movement was only possible by pushing down on the brake pedals from the chief pilot's seat to push upwards on the control column. The investigating committee found evidence of the braking failure in <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>system</b> is {{critical}} {{with respect to}} vehicle safety. One situation during which <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is {{put to the test}} is an Alpine descent. Such a descent causes very high <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> temperatures and may even induce brake fluid vaporization. In following report an In-Vehicle <b>Brake</b> <b>System</b> Temperature Model is developed and tested. This model makes use of the information that is available on the vehicle CAN-bus in order to estimate the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and detect <b>the</b> risk of <b>brake</b> fluid vaporization. Implementing such a model in production vehicles would improve vehicle safety and in the long run allow downsizing of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> without giving in on any safety margins. Firstly, possible approaches for estimating the amount of kinetic energy that is converted into heat by <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are investigated. A Feed-Forward model is developed that uses the pressure in the primary hydraulic circuit as input. The problem with such a Feed-Forward Model is that the friction coefficient is variable. A Feed-Back model that uses the vehicle deceleration as input gives better results. The challenge in this approach {{lies in the fact that}} not all required inputs for the Feed-Back Model are known. Secondly, the Temperature Estimation Model is developed. This is composed of models of different parts of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> which are combined and matched to <b>the</b> measurements. <b>The</b> <b>brake</b> disc is modeled as a lumped mass. <b>The</b> <b>brake</b> pad is modeled as a Finite Difference Thermal Model. The fluid and surrounding caliper are modeled as one lumped mass which receives its heat through conduction from <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pad and spreads the heat into the surroundings by means of convection. Finally, for the Human Machine Interface, several active and passive intervention concepts are proposed. One important challenge to take into account is the uncertainty in <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> fluid boiling temperature, which decreases over the course of time due to brake hygroscopic effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Model {{validation}} needs {{effective and}} efficient after development of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> model. For <b>the</b> relatively high cost and limited coverage of test condition of the experimental verification, a virtual test environment of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is established by using the vehicle model and the graphical interface of mature vehicle dynamics simulation software Carsim. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> model is encapsulated into a dynamic link library. Then <b>the</b> new <b>brake</b> model according {{to the relationship between}} input and output of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and vehicle through the S-function is integrated with Carsim vehicle model in Matlab/Simulink, replacing <b>the</b> Carsim <b>brake</b> model.

25|$|Gearshifting effort, long a {{complaint}} about the Testarossa, was eased {{with a new}} single-plate clutch, sliding ball bearings, and better angle for the shifter. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> included larger front rotors and cross-drilling all around. Quicker steering, lower-profile tires, and new shock settings improved handling. Most importantly, engine and gearbox position was rethought, which improved the centre of gravity, aiding the handling and making the car less fearsome on the limit.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were very subtle. The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car.|$|E
25|$|Pump: The pump in the ABS is used {{to restore}} the {{pressure}} to the hydraulic brakes after the valves have released it. A signal from the controller will release the valve at the detection of wheel slip. After a valve release the pressure supplied from the user, the pump {{is used to}} restore a desired amount of pressure to <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The controller will modulate the pumps status {{in order to provide}} the desired amount of pressure and reduce slipping.|$|E

500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Brazilian Public Safety Ministry released in November 2008 concluded that the pilots mistakenly left the lever for the right engine to climb upon landing, due to a mistake in landing procedures with the right thrust reverser being disabled from a prior maintenance, when {{in fact it was}} necessary to retard both engines in order for the spoilers to work. They also said that the National Civil Aviation Agency should have closed the airport on the night the plane landed because of heavy rains; that Congonhas airport authorities shared the blame because its runway had not been properly constructed with grooves to drain away excess rainwater, contributing to the crash; [...] that the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, should have provided alarms warning the pilots that <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was failing; and that TAM failed to properly train its pilots, who did not act correctly in the emergency.|$|E
