5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning <b>the</b> <b>Cup,</b> in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E

5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were {{bought by the}} NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left {{competing}} for <b>the</b> <b>Cup.</b> Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cup</b> was {{probably}} made in Alexandria, Egypt. It was {{once thought to}} {{date back to the}} Hellenistic period, c. 250 BC, but is now regarded as dating to the 1st century AD. Its supposed connection with the Ptolemies dates back to a description in 1644 by historian Jean Tristan de Saint-Amant; he argued that the vase was made for the funeral processions of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC. Scholar E. Babelon argued that <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> had been made in Egypt during the general time of the Ptolemies, a much looser range stretching from 305 to 30 BC. However, there is no particular evidence for this, and other scholars, such as John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway, suggest that <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> was carved later, during the first or second centuries AD by Romans. Dating <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> has been problematic largely because similar pieces are rare, making comparison difficult.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. <b>The</b> <b>Cup</b> is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving <b>the</b> <b>Cup,</b> to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of <b>the</b> <b>Cup.</b> Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E
5|$|When the NHA was {{suspended}} in 1917, <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> {{was held by}} the Montreal Canadiens. It remained in their care until 1921.

NHL president Frank Calder arranged with Ambrose O'Brien a new deed of gift. <b>The</b> <b>Cup,</b> which Calder had secured following the death of Montreal President George Kennedy, was then presented to the NHL champion Ottawa Senators. In 1925, the NHL inaugurated the Prince of Wales Trophy, which also was presented to the NHL champions.|$|E

Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final.
