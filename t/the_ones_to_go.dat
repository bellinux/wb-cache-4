5000|$|Alongside Nori, Hellion {{is one of}} the {{students}} who wasn't transported to Limbo. While he and Surge argue about his reckless disregard for her leadership by leaving with X-23 to save Mercury and not telling her, the other students inside the X-Mansion get transported to Limbo while they are still outside. Trance used her powers to get a message to the two. She told them that they were taken to hell and then she said [...] "Belasco" [...] and disappeared. Surge and Hellion went to the O*N*E. They found out that Amanda Sefton was in a coma in Germany. The two demanded that they be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> see her. Later Hellion, Surge, and a Sentinel are transported to Limbo by Sefton. They are greeted by thousands if not millions of demons. After Illyana comes to her senses, she teleports everyone back to the X-Mansion.|$|E

[...] "She's All I Ever Had" [...] absolutely succeeds on all levels. Lyrically, Martin narrates the tale of a man missing his woman, as he continues to live and breathe for her. Martin's vocal is tender and heartfelt, boasting a versatility that contrasts nicely with [...] "La Vida," [...] while the lush production is savvy and creatively executed." ...|$|R
