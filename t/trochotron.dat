2500|$|The first trochotrons were {{surrounded}} by a hollow cylindrical magnet, with poles at the ends. The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten [...] "spade" [...] electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a thick sheet (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was not reversible. A later form of <b>trochotron</b> called a Beam-X Switch replaced the large, heavy external cylindrical magnet with ten small internal metal-alloy rod magnets which also served as electrodes.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs {{even had}} another Haydu tube that could {{operate as a}} digital counter and {{directly}} drive a Nixie tube for display. This was called a [...] "Trochotron", in later form known as the [...] "Beam-X Switch" [...] counter tube; another name was [...] "magnetron beam-switching tube", referring to their similarity to a cavity magnetron. <b>Trochotrons</b> {{were used in the}} UNIVAC 1101 computer, as well as in clocks and frequency counters.|$|R
2500|$|Glow-transfer {{counting}} tubes, {{similar in}} essential function to the <b>trochotrons,</b> had a glow discharge {{on one of}} a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of [...] "guide" [...] cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was Dekatron. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named Selectron tubes.|$|R
