Malonic, succinic, glutaric and adipic acids, which are dicarboxylic acids with 1, 2, 3 and 4 straight hydrocarbons located between two carboxylic groups, decreased the OF in a concentration-dependent manner. Other long-chain dicarboxylic acids did not change the OF in rat RBCs. The benzoic acid derivatives, isophthalic and <b>terephthalic</b> <b>acids,</b> but not phthalic acid, decreased the OF in a concentration-dependent manner. Benzene- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylic acid, but not benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid, also decreased the OF in rat RBCs. On the other hand, monocarboxylic acids possessing 2 to 7 straight hydrocarbons and benzoic acid increased the OF in rat RBCs. In short-chain dicarboxylic acids, {{a limited number of}} hydrocarbons between the two carboxylic groups are thought to form a V- or U-shaped structure and interact with phospholipids in the RBC membrane. In benzene dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids, a part of benzene nucleus between the two carboxylic groups is thought to enter the plasma membrane and act on acyl-chain in phospholipids in the RBC membrane. For dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids, limited numbers of hydrocarbons in molecules are speculated to enter the RBC membrane with the hydrophilic carboxylic groups remaining outside, stabilizing the structure of the cell membrane and resulting in an increase in osmotic resistance in rat RBCs...|$|R

This blend system exhibits a single composition-dependent glass transition temperature over the entire composition range. The equilib-rium melting point depression of PBTwas observed, and Flory interaction parameter c 120. 96 was obtained. These indicate that the blends are thermodynamically miscible in the melt. The crystallization rate of PBT decreased {{as the amount of}} PAr(I 27 -T 73) increased, and a contrary trend was found when PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystallized with the increase of the amount of PBT. The addition of high-Tg PAr(I 27 -T 73) would suppress the segmental mobility of PBT, while low-Tg PBT would have promotional effect on PAr(I 27 -T 73). The crystallization rate and melting point of PBT were significantly influenced when the PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystallites are previously formed. It is because not only does the amorphous phase composition shift to a richer PBT content after the crystallization of PAr(I 27 -T 73), but also the PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystal phase would constrain the crystallization of PBT. Thus, effects of the glass transition temperature, interaction between components, and previously formed crystallites of one component on the crystallization behavior of the other component were discussed and compared with blends of PBT and PAr(I- 100) based on Bisphenol A and isophthalic acid...|$|R

40|$|Products of {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) from aromatic {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) – 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, dicarboxylic acids, nitromonoaromatics, and furandiones – were evaluated for their potential to serve as anthropogenic SOA tracers {{with respect to their}} (1)  ambient concentrations and detectability in PM 2. 5 in Iowa City, IA, USA; (2)  gas–particle partitioning behaviour; and (3)  source specificity by way of correlations with primary and secondary source tracers and literature review. A widely used tracer for toluene-derived SOA, 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid was only detected in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1) at low but consistently measurable ambient concentrations (averaging 0. 3  ng m − 3). Four aromatic dicarboxylic acids were detected at relatively higher concentrations (9. 1 – 34. 5  ng m − 3), of which phthalic acid was the most abundant. Phthalic acid had a low particle-phase fraction (F p [*]=[*]  0. 26) likely due to quantitation interferences from phthalic anhydride, while 4 -methylphthalic acid was predominantly in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 0. 82). Phthalic acid and 4 -methylphthalic acid were both highly correlated with 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid (r s [*]=[*] 0. 73, p [*]=[*] 0. 003; r s [*]=[*] 0. 80, p [*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively), suggesting that they were derived from aromatic VOCs. Isophthalic and <b>terephthalic</b> <b>acids,</b> however, were detected only in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1), and correlations suggested association with primary emission sources. Nitromonoaromatics were dominated by particle-phase concentrations of 4 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) and 4 -methyl- 5 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) that were associated with biomass burning. Meanwhile, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol was detected in a lower concentration (0. 06  ng m − 3) in the particle phase only (F p [*]=[*] 1) and is known as a product of toluene photooxidation. Furandiones in the atmosphere have only been attributed to the photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons; however the substantial partitioning toward the gas phase (F p  [*]≤[*]  0. 16) and their water sensitivity limit their application as tracers. The outcome of this study is the demonstration that 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, phthalic acid, 4 -methylphthalic acid, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol are good candidates for tracing SOA from aromatic VOCs...|$|R

Poly- 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazoles are also prepared by means of a polycondensation reaction between <b>terephthalic</b> and isophthalic <b>acid</b> and hydrazine yielding poly- 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazoles with higher inherent viscosities.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the use of}} electron spin resonance spectroscopy in investigations of the reduction {{of a number of}} organic compounds by solutions of sodium in liquid ammonia. Solutions of alkali metals in ammonia contain the ammoniated electron, in all its possible forms, and essentially this species is the effective reducing agent. The simple reduction step is the one-electron addition to a suitable substrate molecule, which may then undergo a number of successive reactions before a stable product is formed. The nature of the metal-ammonia solutions, and the paths the reductions may take are discussed in Chapter 2. The simple one-electron reduction product, a radical-anion, is often too short-lived to allow observation by normal static methods, and therefore a relatively high concentration of radicals must be artificially maintained to permit their detection. Basically two different approaches have been utilised: i. 	Stabilising the radicals either by direct production or trapping in solid matrix, therefore preventing the radicals from reacting, and ii. 	Production of a high steady state concentration of radicals in solution by either continuous electrolysis or buy use of a flow system, A brief discussion of the methods used in the study of transient radicals is given in Chapter 1. Generally the e. s. r spectra are less well-resolved in solid matrices than in solutions, and for species showing a large amount of hyperfine structure, production of the radicals in solution is preferred. A rapid mixing device has been developed to allow observation of transient intermediates by e. s. r. spectroscopy. The mixer was designed particularly for the type of system and experimental technique under consideration here, and is based on a design used in biological kinetic studies. Observations 2 - 5 msec. after mixing are possible, and this represents a considerable advantage over the widely used aqueous solution mixing device, where observations are made on a 10 - 2 sec. time scale. The mixing chamber and experimental technique are presented in Chapter 3. Analysis of the e. s. r. spectrum of a compound allows the calculation of its unpaired electron distribution, the coupling constants being related to the unpaired electron spin density. Spin densities have been calculated theoretically, and it has been found that simple Hückel calculations of pi-electron spin densities show good agreement with “experimentally” determined values. Accordingly, both Hückel and McLachlan spin densities have been calculated for most of the substrates used, and in general it is found that the McLachlan treatment gives better agreement with experiment than the simple Hückel model. A brief discussion of the relevant molecular orbital theory is presented in Chapter 1, and the computer programme used to perform the theoretical calculations is given in Appendix 3. Analysis of the e. s. r. spectra I sometimes very difficult if a large number of lines are present, and two computer programmes used for the simulation of single and mixed e. s. r. spectra are given in Appendices 2 and 3 respectively. In Chapter 4 is described the reduction of a number of aryl halides. With the exception of fluoro-substituted compounds, the halo-pyridines, pyrimidines, benzenes, biphenyls, and naphthalene, all give the e. s. r. spectrum of the radical-anions of the parent compounds on reduction. On the other hand, fluorine is retained as is evident from the spectra, for a much longer period, as shown by observation 0. 1 and 1. 0 sec. after mixing, while static experiments show some products to be stable {{for longer periods of time}} in this system. Mechanisms have been proposed to account for these reductions. Halobenzonitriles have also been studies and the results are in agreement with the proposed reduction mechanisms. Reduction of pyridine, pyrimidine and some simple ring-substituted compounds has been investigated, and their e. s. r. spectra characterised in most cases. Previous attempts to observe the pyridine radical-anion had failed, the spectrum of the 4, 4 ’-bipyridyl being obtained instead. Observations 0. 1, 1. 0 sec. and 1 min. after mixing allow the reduction path of these nitrogen heterocyclics to be followed, and it is shown that pyridine, pyrimidine and simple alkyl- and alkoxy-substituted pyridines undergo dimerization to give exclusively the respective 4, 4 ’-dimers, unless the 4 -position is blocked. Pyridine-N-oxide undergoes a more complex reduction, giving pyridine-N-oxide, pyridine and finally 2, 2 ’-bipridyl radical-anions. Pyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid gives a spectrum suggesting some form of nitrogen-hydrogen bonded species. Pyridine dicarboxylic acids all have on feature in common, a splitting from an extra proton which arises through a protonated nitrogen atom. Reduction of pyridine in the presence of excess ethanol also shows this feature, and its spectrum is due to C 5 H 5 NH. Calculation of the nitrogen sigma-pi interaction parameters gives values of QNN=+ 28. 5 oe. And QCNN=-O. 5 oe., in good agreement with results obtained previously. Theoretical calculations have been performed, and comparison with experiment has enabled the assignment of coupling constants to particular positions, and also gives the best set of parameter values required for the calculations, providing a check with values used for comparison with other measurements. The results are presented in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 is described the reduction of benzoic acid and some of its simple ring-substituted derivate. Ionisation occurs initially, followed by reduction to give the corresponding radical-anions. These species are short-lived, as no spectra are obtained when observations are performed 0. 1 sec. after mixing. No further paramagnetic products are found. Molecular orbital calculations have been performed for each compound, and excellent agreement with experiment obtained using the parameter values kC’-C= 1, 2, kC-O- 1, 6, hO- 2. 0 for the ionised carboxyl group. Reduction of nitro-substituted isophthalic and <b>terephthalic</b> <b>acids</b> shows the presence of two distinct species, one being unstable while the other is stable for more than one hour, in both cases. The unstable species show a large splitting from an extra proton which is thought to be attached to the nitrogen atom. This proton is lost to give the stable radicals, experimental evidence and comparison with computer calculations suggesting them to be the nitro-substituted radical-anions. ...|$|R

Tai {{in central and}} east China {{during the spring of}} 2009 including a massive dust storm occurring on 24 April (named as DS II), and determined for organic compounds to investigate the impact of dust storm on organic aerosols. High molecular weight (HMW) n -alkanes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols and trehalose sharply increased and almost entirely stayed in coarse particles when dust storm was present, suggesting that high level of organic aerosols in the mountain atmospheres during the event largely originated from Gobi desert plants. However, most anthropogenic aerosols (e. g. PAHs, and aromatic and dicarboxylic acids) during the event significantly decreased due to a dilution effect, indicating that anthropogenic aerosols in the mountain atmospheres during the nonevent period largely originated from local/regional sources rather than from long-range transport. Trehalose, a metabolism product enriched in biota in dry conditions, was 62 ± 78 and 421 ± 181 ng m − 3 at Mt. Hua and Mt. Tai during DS II, 10 – 30 times higher than that in the nonevent time, indicating that trehalose may be a tracer for dust emissions from Gobi desert regions. Molecular compositions of organic aerosols in the mountain samples demonstrate that domestic coal burning is still the major source of PAHs in China. n -Alkanes and fatty acids showed a bimodal size distribution during the nonevent with a major peak in fine mode ( 2. 1 μm). The coarse mode significantly increased and even dominated over the whole size range when dust was present. Glucose and trehalose were also dominant in the coarse mode especially in the DS II time. PAHs and levoglucosan concentrated in fine particles with no significant changes in size distribution when dust storm occurred. However, phthalic and succinic acids showed bimodal size distribution pattern with an increase in coarse mode during the event, because both are formed via a gas phase oxidation and a subsequent condensation/adsorption onto aerosol phase. In contrast, <b>terephthalic</b> and malic <b>acids</b> are mostly emitted from combustion process as fine particles, thus both showed a fine mode pattern during the whole campaign with a minor peak in coarse mode caused by an increased coagulation with dust during the event. Geometric mean diameters (GMDs) of the organic aerosols above are in general larger at Mt. ~Hua than at Mt. Tai during the nonevent period. We found that during the event GMD of the fine mode organics that derived mostly from the local/regional sources rather than Gobi desert became smaller while GMD of them in coarse mode became larger. Such a splitting in sizes during the event is most likely caused by decreased fine particle coagulation due to dilution and increased adsorption/coagulation with dust...|$|R

HMF and methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) oxidation was also studied {{with a series of}} conventional metal bromide catalysts (Co, Mn, Br) used for the oxidation of para-xylene to <b>terephthalic</b> <b>acid.</b> Also, the direct, one pot dehydration and oxidation of fructose to FDCA via intermediate HMF has been investigated with good selectivities, unfortunately this system does not work in water.|$|E

The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran. Both of these latter materials can serve as alcohol components in the production of new polyester, and their combination with FDCA would lead to a new family of completely biomass-derived products. Extension of these concepts to the production of new nylons, either through reaction of FDCA with diamines, or through the conversion of FDCA to 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)tetrahydrofuran. FDCA can also serve as a starting material for the production of succinic acid, whose utility is elsewhere.|$|E
