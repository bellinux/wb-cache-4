25|$|In general terms, {{gravitational}} waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, {{provided that the}} motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning dumbbell. If <b>the</b> <b>dumbbell</b> spins around its axis of symmetry, it will not radiate {{gravitational waves}}; if it tumbles end over end, {{as in the case}} of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier <b>the</b> <b>dumbbell,</b> and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbell</b> are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{properties of}} spherical tracers coupled through a repulsive potential {{to a system}} of active dumbbells are analyzed. We model the dumbbells' dynamics with Langevin equations and the activity with a self-propulsive force of constant magnitude directed along the main axis of the molecules. Two types of tracers are considered. Thermal tracers are coupled to the same bath as <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> while athermal tracers are not; both interact repulsively with <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells.</b> We focus our attention on the intruders' mean square displacement and how it compares to the one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells.</b> We show that the dynamics of thermal intruders, with mass similar to the one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells,</b> display <b>the</b> typical four time-lag regimes of the dumbbells' mean square displacement. The thermal tracers' late-time diffusion coefficient depends on their mass very weakly and it is close to the one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> at low Péclet only. Athermal tracers only have ballistic and late-time diffusive regimes. The late time diffusion coefficients of athermal tracers and dumbbells have similar values at high Péclet number when their masses are of the same order, while at low Péclet number this coefficient gets close to the one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> only when <b>the</b> tracers are several order of magnitude heavier than <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells.</b> We propose a generalization of the Enskog law for dilute hard disks, that describes the athermal tracers' mean square displacement {{in the form of a}} scaling law in terms of their mass...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{systematic}} investigation of trisradical tricationic complexes formed between cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) bisradical dicationic (CBPQT 2 (•+)) rings {{and a series of}} 18 dumbbells, containing centrally located 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium radical cationic (BIPY•+) units within oligomethylene chains terminated for the most part by charged 3, 5 -dimethylpyridinium (PY+) and/or neutral 3, 5 -dimethylphenyl (PH) groups, are reported. The complexes were obtained by treating equimolar amounts of the CBPQT 4 + ring and <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> containing BIPY 2 + units with zinc dust in acetonitrile (MeCN) solutions. Whereas UV-VIS-NIR spectra revealed absorption bands centered on ca. 1100 nm with quite different intensities for the 1 : 1 complexes depending on the constitutions and charges on <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells,</b> titration experiments show that the association constants (Ka) for complex formation vary over a wide range from Ka values of 800 M^(- 1) for the weakest to 180000 M^(- 1) for the strongest. While Coulombic repulsions emanating from PY+ groups located at the ends of some of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> undoubtedly contribute to the destabilization of the trisradical tricationic complexes, solid-state superstructures support the contention that those dumbbells with neutral PH groups at the ends of flexible and appropriately constituted links to the BIPY•+ units stand to gain some additional stabilization from C‒H···π interactions between the CBPQT 2 (•+) rings and the PH termini on <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells.</b> <b>The</b> findings reported in this full paper demonstrate how structural changes implemented remotely from the BIPY•+ units influence their noncovalent bonding interactions with CBPQT 2 (•+) rings. Different secondary effects (Coulombic repulsions versus C‒H···π interactions) are uncovered and their contributions to both binding strengths associated with trisradical interactions and the kinetics of associations and dissociations are discussed at some length and are supported by extensive DFT calculations at the M 06 -D 3 level.

2500|$|The {{method of}} {{slipping}} is one which exploits the thermodinamic [...] {{stability of the}} rotaxane.

2500|$|A rotaxane is a {{mechanically}} interlocked molecular architecture {{consisting of}} a [...] "dumbbell shaped molecule" [...] which is threaded through a [...] "macrocycle" [...] (see graphical representation). The name {{is derived from the}} Latin for wheel (rota) and axle (axis).

2500|$|Rotaxane-based {{molecular}} machines {{have been}} of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular shuttles. These molecular machines are usually based on {{the movement of the}} macrocycle on <b>the</b> <b>dumbbell.</b> The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of <b>the</b> <b>dumbbell</b> like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a molecular switch, with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [...] and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles.

In this case, the 4C1 or 1C4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.|$|E

40|$|Representational {{momentum}} is {{the tendency to}} misremember the stopping point of a moving object as further forward {{in the direction of}} movement. Results of several studies suggest that this effect is typical for changes in position (e. g. translation) and not for changes in object shape (transformation). Additionally, the effect seems to be stronger in motor tasks than in perceptual tasks. Here, participants judged the final distance between two spheres after this distance had been increasing or decreasing. The spheres were two separately translating objects or were connected to form a single transforming object (a dumbbell). Participants also performed a motor task in which they grasped virtual versions of the final objects. We found representational momentum for the visual judgment task for both stimulus types. As predicted, it was stronger for the spheres than for <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells.</b> In contrast, for grasping, only <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> produced representational momentum (a larger maximum grip aperture when <b>the</b> <b>dumbbells</b> had been growing compared to when they had been shrinking) even though the grasp locations and their movement were identical to that of the spheres. As type of stimulus change had these different effects on representational momentum for perception and action, we conclude that different sources of information are used in the two tasks or that they are governed by different mechanisms...|$|R

Owing to his recent divorce from Dahmer's mother, Dahmer's father temporarily lived in a nearby motel and his mother had relocated to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, with his younger brother. On June 18, Dahmer picked up an 18-year-old hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks. Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the two young men drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert in Lockwood Corners, agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} reported {{synthesis of}} a rotaxane in 1967 {{relied on the}} statistical probability that if two halves of a dumbbell-shaped molecule were reacted {{in the presence of}} a macrocycle that some small percentage would connect through the ring.
