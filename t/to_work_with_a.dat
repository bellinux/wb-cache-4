5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Heart of Darkness in 1998, Chahi left the video games industry to explore other interests, and subsequently developed a passion for volcanology. In the past, Chahi self-produced video games, as the PC market was independent games-orientated. However, the independent game's importance diminished by 2006, so Chahi decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> publisher instead. He presented the concept to Ubisoft in 2006. According to Chahi, it was not difficult to convince Ubisoft to fund the project, though initially there was hesitation and the proposal was rejected. After the company reversed its decision, the team spent approximately two years meeting with the key people within Ubisoft; development properly began in January 2008. The team initially only had three people, but it was expanded to about 15 to 20 people, which was considered a small team for Ubisoft.|$|E

Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaraní and Spanish {{literature}} at the University of Toulouse. Although {{he had been}} allowed to visit Paraguay <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities. There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of Yo, el Supremo, I, The Supreme, published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos left his post at the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andrés Rodríguez.|$|E

Additionally, Hasselbaink, despite the conflict of interest, was open to the idea of signing players represented by the firm. Queens Park Rangers launched an internal investigation and went on to release a statement fully backing Hasselbaink and stated that The Daily Telegraph failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding their sting operation.|$|E

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D would be forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near {{the end of the}} match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|The last plank in Patton's {{education}} platform was {{the improvement}} of adult education. This issue allowed him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> political foe, Republican senator David L. Williams, who had been pushing for additional resources for adult education since 1997. In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on adult education, and 18months later, the task force's recommendations were incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly unanimously. By 2003, the number of adults completing their GED rose by 17percent, {{and the number of}} GED recipients who matriculated to college rose from 13percent to 18percent.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E

5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were}} an actual battle.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E
