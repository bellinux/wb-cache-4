He understands just as clearly that to satisfy his needs without contributing, to the best of his ability, his share of labour in maintaining the general well-being, would be to live at the expense of others--to become an exploiter and live as the rich drones live to-day.

60|$|Philosophically, Don Juan {{is a man}} who, though gifted {{enough to}} be {{exceptionally}} capable of distinguishing between good and evil, follows his own instincts {{without regard to the}} common statute, or canon law; and <b>therefore,</b> <b>whilst</b> gaining the ardent sympathy of our rebellious instincts (which are flattered by the brilliancies with which Don Juan associates them) finds himself in mortal conflict with existing institutions, and defends himself by fraud and farce as unscrupulously as a farmer defends his crops by the same means against vermin. The prototypic Don Juan, invented early in the XVI century by a Spanish monk, was presented, according to the ideas of that time, as the enemy of God, the approach of whose vengeance is felt throughout the drama, growing in menace from minute to minute. No anxiety is caused on Don Juan's account by any minor antagonist: he easily eludes the police, temporal and spiritual; and when an indignant father seeks private redress with the sword, Don Juan kills him without an effort. Not until the slain father returns from heaven as the agent of God, in the form of his own statue, does he prevail against his slayer and cast him into hell. The moral is a monkish one: repent and reform now; for to-morrow it may be too late. This is really the only point on which Don Juan is sceptical; for he is a devout believer in an ultimate hell, and risks damnation only because, as he is young, it seems so far off that repentance can be postponed until he has amused himself to his heart's content.|$|E
60|$|In {{all this}} time the true state of the several Presidencies, and the real conduct of the British {{government}} towards the natives, {{was not at all}} known to Parliament: it seems to have been very imperfectly known even to ministers. Indeed, it required an unbroken attention, and much comparison of facts and reasonings, to form a true judgment on that difficult and complicated system of politics, revenue, and commerce, whilst affairs were only in their progress to that state which produced the present inquiries. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>whilst</b> the causes of their ruin were in the height of their operation, both the Company and the natives were understood by the public as in circumstances the most assured and most flourishing; insomuch that, whenever the affairs of India were brought before Parliament, as they were two or three times during that period, the only subject-matter of discussion anywise important was concerning the sums which might be taken out of the Company's surplus profits for the advantage of the state. Little was thought of but the disengagement of the Company from their debts in England, and to prevent the servants abroad from drawing upon them, so as that body might be enabled, without exciting clamors here, to afford the contribution that was demanded. All descriptions of persons, either here or in India, looking solely to appearances at home, the reputation of the Directors depended on the keeping the Company's sales in a situation to support the dividend, that of the ministers depended on the most lucrative bargains for the Exchequer, and that of the servants abroad on the largest investments; until at length there is great reason to apprehend, that, unless some very substantial reform takes place in the management of the Company's affairs, nothing will be left for investment, for dividend, or for bargain, and India, instead of a resource to the public, may itself come, in no great length of time, to be reckoned amongst the public burdens.|$|E

30|$|The {{current work}} also offers some further {{insight into the}} {{possibility}} of specific face-processing ability, such as Verhallen’s f (Verhallen et al., 2017). In their recent study, Verhallen et al. (2017) found that performance in the Mooney Test, which entails perception of a face from black and white shapes, was associated with face matching and face memory ability. However, although the Mooney Test was described by the researchers {{as a test of}} face detection, this task differs importantly from face detection as measured in the current study. Specifically, the Mooney Test measures observers’ ability to organise black and white shapes into a face-like arrangement, as opposed to visually searching for a realistic representation of a human face within complex natural scenes. Moreover, these Mooney arrangements are not faces per se, but rather represent face-like objects, and can therefore be of only limited value to understanding how human faces are processed. The current results suggest, <b>therefore,</b> that <b>whilst</b> Verhallen’s f may account for shared variability in face memory and face matching, this does not underpin the ability to detect actual faces.|$|R

50|$|A {{negative}} corona {{is manifested}} in a non-uniform corona, varying {{according to the}} surface features and irregularities of the curved conductor. It often appears as tufts of corona at sharp edges, the number of tufts altering with {{the strength of the}} field. The form of negative coronas is a result of its source of secondary avalanche electrons (see below). It appears a little larger than the corresponding positive corona, as electrons are allowed to drift out of the ionising region, and so the plasma continues some distance beyond it. The total number of electrons, and electron density is much greater than in the corresponding positive corona. However, they are of a predominantly lower energy, owing to being in a region of lower potential-gradient. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>whilst</b> for many reactions the increased electron density will increase the reaction rate, the lower energy of the electrons will mean that reactions which require a higher electron energy may take place at a lower rate.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, however, {{it could}} be argued that {{intoxication}} is not a defense, but a denial of mens rea; the main difference being that a defense accepts the mens rea and actus reus of an offence are present. With intoxication, there is no acceptance of the mens rea of the offence. For offences of basic intent, the act itself is criminalised. All that is needed is the intent to do the act. It can therefore be inferred that there is such intent relatively easily; when intoxicated one is not an automaton - there is still control of one's actions. Therefore, intoxication will rarely (if ever) deny the mens rea of crimes of basic intent. With specific intent, the character of the act is criminalised, for the act itself is often objectively innocent. Appropriation of an item is perfectly innocent, yet when one appropriates with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, there is a theft. This is much more difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, for an intoxicated person may exercise control over his actions but will often lack an understanding of what is being done - without this understanding the necessary intent cannot be proven. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>whilst</b> it is tempting to think of intoxication as a defense, it is more accurate to see it as a denial of the mens rea of an offence - where the mens rea or actus reus is not proven, there is no need for defenses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSchool {{holidays}} are recognised {{to be of}} great epidemiological importance {{for a wide range}} of infectious diseases; this is postulated to be because the social mixing patterns of school children – a key population group – change significantly during the holiday period. However, there is little direct quantitative evidence to confirm this belief. Here, we present the results of a prospective survey designed to provide a detailed comparison of social mixing patterns of school children during school terms and during the school holidays. Paired data were collected, with participants recording their social contacts once during term time and once during the holiday period. We found that the daily number of recorded encounters approximately halved during the holidays, and that the number of close contact encounters fell by approximately one third. The holiday period also saw a change in the age structure of children's social contacts, with far fewer contacts of their own age, but an increase in the number of encounters with adults, particularly older adults. A greater amount of mixing between children at different schools was recorded during the holiday. We suggest, <b>therefore,</b> that <b>whilst</b> infections may spread rapidly within schools during term time, in the holiday period there are increased opportunities for transmission to other schools and other age groups...|$|R

The precise regulation of the AP- 1 family by agents that are known to activate MC is, however, poorly understood. The action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and, for the first time, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on AP- 1 gene expression in MC was <b>therefore</b> studied. <b>Whilst</b> the expression of JunD was not affected by any of the mediators, the mRNA levels of c-fos and JunB were induced by LPS, IL- 6, IFN-γ, PDGF and TNF-α, and that of c-jun by LPS, IFN-γ, PDGF and TNF-α. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed a time-dependent increase in AP- 1 DNA binding activity with JunB representing the major mediator-inducible member involved in DNA–protein interactions. However, stimulus-specific changes in the kinetics and magnitude of AP- 1 mRNA expression and DNA binding activity were identified and, additionally, the results showed the potential existence of cell-type-specific mechanisms in the regulation of the AP- 1 family. These studies provide novel insights into the mediator-specific modulation of AP- 1 -regulated gene expression and the activation of MC in renal diseases...|$|R
