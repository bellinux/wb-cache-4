30|$|SNA, even if {{limited by}} the {{relational}} data obtained, {{also contributed to the}} discussion, mainly in two ways. The first finding suggests difficulties for the KTOs to connect with their internal stakeholders, such as the research groups within the universities. KTO 1, despite being a division of the university, focused its support, on the one hand, <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> who want to leave the campus and go to the market, for example, with a spin-off, and on the other hand, in the modernisation of existing firms that need to collaborate with the university. In this way a policy implication from the network analysis is that the attention to internal audiences should be improved and extended in the early stage of KTOs to gain legitimisation. University-industry relations can only be effective if KTOs actually know their own academic environment and research capabilities. KTOs should structure proactive strategies to meet internal capabilities with potentially interested demands from the economic fabric.|$|E

40|$|Higher Education {{magazines}} have {{echoed the}} rapid spread of MOOCs in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) since 2012. In their pages, MOOC related articles are proliferating. The focus of such articles {{has often been}} the disruptive nature {{as well as the}} survival of this new form of open online education, especially the first years. However, there is also a great deal of mentions of how internal stakeholders in HEIs perceive the advent of MOOCs. These perceptions are the object of analysis in this article. Using the Content Analysis (CA) method, MOOC related sources in three Higher Education magazines during 2014 have been analysed against a set of key themes. These themes have been established by combining data from two previous studies: a Content Analysis of MOOC related academic literature, and a set of interviews <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> using grounded theory. As the findings indicate, in 2014 the main concerns of internal stakeholders have been the new teaching practices and new work dynamics resulting from the incorporation of MOOCs in their working routines.

30|$|Less well studied {{have been}} issues {{involving}} stakeholder-specific CSR reporting disclosures practices (Hahn and Lülfs 2014; Orzes et al. 2018), although the extant {{research has been}} increasing in recent years. While many studies reference stakeholder theory, including as a lens of analysis (Waddock 2004; Reynolds and Yuthas 2008; Barkemeyer and Figge 2014; Herremans et al. 2016), we find little empirical research which differentiates among multiple groups of stakeholders within CSR reporting disclosures (Orzes et al. 2018). Boesso et al. (2015) suggest prioritized CSR activities can lead to enhanced corporate social performance, particularly in relation <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> Meanwhile, Vazquez-Brust et al. (2010) distinguished environmental responses across 17 distinct stakeholder groups and found that stakeholder salience is not perfectly correlated with firm-level responses to environmental responses. Meanwhile, in differentiating interactive relationships among the firm and its stakeholders, Dobele et al. (2014) argue that the firm is a member of, but not central within, the network of stakeholder relationships in which it operates; that {{the interaction between the}} firm and its stakeholders are not dyadic in nature; and that interactive effects need to be assessed as part of complex stakeholder relationships. Without diverging into a discussion of network theory, which {{is beyond the scope of}} this article, we return to an examination of our central research questions involving stakeholder-specific CSR reporting and differences in the nature of that reporting for CSR-oriented firms.|$|E

On the basis that keeping promises is a valuable marketing and organisational outcome, there is considerable value for organisations to understand the role of communication in informing employees of those promises, and identifying how enabled they are in fulfilling those same promises. Four New Zealand electricity companies participated in a collective case study that included archival data and semi-structured interviews with senior managers, operational managers, marketing, and human resources personnel. Using a mixed-methods approach, thematic analysis of the interviews and a further {{review of the literature}} were used to develop an internal marketing (IM) communication survey.

This study makes a contribution to the field of IM by providing empirical evidence of the influence of internal communication in enabling employees to deliver on the organisation’s service promises to customers. The research reveals factors that influence channel effectiveness, demonstrates the importance of collegial relationships in organisational feedback, and assesses the significance of values commitment on employee perceptions of their company’s ability to deliver on its promises.

40|$|Abstract (engelsk sammendrag) The {{purpose of}} this study is to get a deeper {{understanding}} of how companies communicate their CSR initiatives and issues <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> The main research question is: “How do companies communicate their CSR initiatives in order to create engagement and commitment among internal stakeholders?”. This is followed by four supplementary research questions: 1) “To what extent are internal stakeholders aware of and engaged in the companies CSR initiatives?”; 2) “To what extent are internal stakeholders involved in CSR initiatives?”; 3) “Which message channels are being used for communicating CSR initiatives?” and 4) “How does the company’s external communication affect internal stakeholders?”. The research questions are answered through a qualitative case study consisting of three large regional companies in the municipality of Hedmark in Norway. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with both managers and employees, in total 14 respondents. The main findings show that the awareness and engagement of CSR is high among most of the employees. The main underlying cause of this, in this case, is the degree of involvement, which seems to be the utmost important factor for increased commitment and engagement to CSR and their associated activities. The most used communication channels are intranet, e-mails, face-to-face, department-, house- and video meetings. However, the preferred channel among internal stakeholders turned out to be face-to-face communication, with the desire of having the opportunity to give feedback and suggestions for improvement. The companies in this study seemed good at involving employees on top- and middle manager level. On lower positions, however, the involvement was arguably at a bare minimum, with the consequence of low commitment and engagement. The company’s own websites and annual reports seem to have little to no significant impact on employees, whereas social media and newspaper articles stand higher on the perceived impact – something perhaps overlook, but a considerably important channel for reaching employees...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addressed}} {{the theme of}} authentic CSR based on a virtues and a charismatic approach. Several studies—which {{are part of the}} theoretical framework of CSR and are placed within ethical theories—underline how entrepreneurial behaviors and values lie at the base of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) -oriented strategies and actions. The business ethics literature emphasises the values dimension of entrepreneurial and managerial activity and has introduced concepts such as management integrity, authenticity and virtues, which are becoming widespread in the corporate context. Departing from these premises, the works focuses on entrepreneurial and managerial leadership and on its attributes and role in developing an authentic CSR oriented strategy. The work addresses the following questions: Can a business become a laboratory capable of orienting and educating stakeholders’ “minds and hearts”? How does leadership affect the dissemination of a CSR authentic orientation {{at all levels of the}} organization? On which values and virtues is an authentic leadership based? And how can virtues be used to trigger stakeholder engagement, with particular reference <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders,</b> like employees? These questions are the thread from which the study has been developed, focusing on the factors affecting leadership that put social responsibility as the foundation of behaviors, actions and strategies to be disseminated and shared inside and outside the company. First, the work offers an analysis of the leadership theoretical framework paying specific attention to values and virtues-based models of leadership. Secondly, the paper presents the first results of an empirical analysis, centered on an exemplary case study relative to a company—the Loccioni Group—which has for years built the CSR-orientation into its mission and governance model and, recently, has been implementing a project aimed to assess virtues among its stakeholders, departing initially from its employees. The results of the study have both scientific and managerial implications and they underline the need for developing a methodology that allows further empirical research on the relationship between ethical values, humanistic education, family and social structures and the development of an authentic CSR-oriented model of entrepreneurial leadership...|$|E
40|$|In a {{knowledge}} economy most companies try to attract, motivate and retain {{a high quality}} workforce, {{which has become a}} competitive advantage in an environment of increasing skills shortage. By being perceived as an attractive workplace, especially if the company reputation and image is valuable, rare and not easily imitated, companies can attract and maintain a high quality workforce. Research shows that individuals with a high number of job choices, such as with high education levels, are likely to respond in a strong and positive way to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), to feel enthusiastic to work for a company committed to CSR and to express high levels of dedication to company success. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a better understanding of companies’ use of CSR to attract, motivate and retain human resource talents. The research questions address these issues dealing with the relation between CSR and companies’ human resources and how companies communicate CSR internally and externally. The companies selected for this study were two knowledge- intensive multinational corporations operating in Sweden. Qualitative case studies were conducted. Findings show that companies are not only adopting CSR but are also incorporating it into their way of conducting business and into the organizational culture. This approach to CSR integrates CSR into the professional responsibilities of every employee, no matter where in the company they work, thereby involving them in the CSR work. The companies also target CSR activities towards fulfilling employee needs, and communicate CSR internally with objectives such as to achieve compliance and engagement by the employees, to give them information to respond to tough questions from the public and to give them a feeling that they are working for a company that does something good. Companies are also aware that CSR is a hot topic in society and make serious efforts in auditing and reporting CSR, presenting it <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> as well as making it available to external stakeholders. However, the companies do not take any measures to target the information towards potential employees. Thus there seems to be a lack of connection between the use of CSR and attracting human resources when it comes to communicating CSR externally. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Public Relations Management in the Faculty of Informatics and Design at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 This study investigated how the KickStart project, a flagship project of Kgalagadi Breweries Limited (KBL), has contributed to KBL’s reputation. The research sought to understand {{the aims of the}} project and to examine whether KickStart’s objectives are aligned to KBL goals. It also discusses stakeholder engagement and youth perceptions about the project, paying attention to the ways these factors seamlessly contribute to KBL’s reputation. The study was framed around the epistemological assumption that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of major companies is essential for addressing social problems within local communities and for building mutual beneficial relationships. However, these companies often exclude communities in their CSR programmes, or the programmes fail to meet the needs and expectations of the communities. These factors often impact negatively on the image and reputation of the companies involved. This is a case-study of the KBL project-KickStart and uses a qualitative methodology to glean empirical data. The research methods include a questionnaire and interviews administered to 16 participants selected from KBL, Botswana National Youth Council, the Department of Youth, and youth who have received financial assistance from KickStart. A questionnaire were also administered to another youth group that received financial support under the Youth Development Fund, managed by the Department of Youth. An analysis of documents such as media reports and the Sechaba Breweries Holdings Limited past annual reports were made. Observations were also made during visits to youth businesses while the questionnaires. The literature on theories of CSR and the responsibilities of business provided the conceptual and theoretical framework for this research. This body of knowledge attempted to tease out the main responsibilities of business, namely economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities and bring them to bear on the main focus of the project. Stakeholder theory provided the main theoretical thrust for this study because it highlights the multiple relationships that a company has with business partners, employees, government, suppliers, consumers, and communities, and that they all have expectations in terms of how a company should behave, and dictate what acceptable behaviour is. The value of involving stakeholders in CSR programmes will enhance a company’s reputation if communities are happy with the programmes; they will buy the goods and services procured by the company and recommend the company to others, employees will be motivated, and the company’s productivity levels will increase thus increasing profit margins. Suppliers will be happy to do business with the company. Businesses, to fulfil their mandates, enter into several relationships with key stakeholders who are prioritised according to their power, legitimacy, and the urgency of the issues at hand. Key findings from the study are that the aim of the KickStart is to empower youth to manage sustainable projects and create employment to improve the well-being of communities. KickStart is a flagship CSR programme of KBL, opening opportunities for the youth through development of their entrepreneurship skills. Its objectives are to support the government to address unemployment among the youth and facilitate sustainable economic development. The youth perceive KickStart as a good project; it offers them financial support, business management training, and a year’s mentorship to sustain their businesses. They acknowledge the contribution KickStart makes to uplift their lives and identify with the KBL brand, which positively reflects KBL as a good company. Stakeholders are important; they must be involved in CSR programmes and their concerns and issues should be considered for the success of the programmes. KBL has limited its stakeholder engagement <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> namely, the trustees and the project manager, and externally the media and judges. Collaboration with the youth organisations will give credibility to KickStart whose target audience is the youth. While acknowledging limited stakeholder engagement, the CSR implementation framework is recommended for KBL to streamline and prioritise key issues around the high unemployment among the youth, identify key players to be involved, and specify what their contributions should be in addressing the problem...|$|E
40|$|During the {{building}} design process hundreds of {{decisions are made}} at different stages, and with multiple stakeholders. This includes choosing alternative materials, components, assemblies, systems, and buildings shapes. The design team faces many challenges in order to evaluate which alternative is more sustainable. The methods used in making those decisions must take {{the complexity of the}} design process into account and help the design team in understanding the trade-offs that must be made. This must be done based on context, and in a transparent and collaborative fashion. What is more, the design team may benefit from keeping decisions objective {{for as long as possible}} during the decision process to avoid unnecessary conflict and suboptimal decisions. Ultimately, the decision-making method used in those decisions will impact the final building design, and therefore, {{the building}}'s social-, environmental -, and economic outcomes. Much like designers and engineers benefit from relying on specific modeling-, analysis-, and evaluation methods to inform their judgment in the course of the design, the design team would also benefit from relying on decision-making methods. However, the architecture-, engineering-, and construction-management literature provides almost no guidance <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> (owner, architect, design specialists, etc.) on how to choose a sustainable alternative (e. g., choosing materials, components, assemblies, systems, building layouts). This research evaluates the ability of Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods to help design teams choose a sustainable alternative during commercial building design. The researcher identified several types of MCDM methods in the literature. Those with potential application for the `choosing problem' studied in this research are (1) Goal-programming and multi-objective optimization methods, (2) Value-based methods (including Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Weighting Rating and Calculating (WRC)), (3) Outranking methods, and (4) Choosing By Advantages (CBA). The researcher compared these different types of methods and judged them on how they help in creating transparency, building consensus, and continuous learning for the problem of choosing a sustainable alternative in commercial building design. Thus far the literature contains no such comparison. The research method included interviews in the early exploratory phase and case-study research for testing the methods. The researcher further compared AHP vs. CBA and WRC vs. CBA through case studies. The researcher selected AHP for its prevalence in AEC decision-making literature, WRC for its widespread use in AEC design practice, and CBA for its potential support in creating transparency, building consensus, and continuous learning, better than either one of these two methods do. From the four types of methods studied the researcher found that: (1) Goal-programming and multi-objective optimization methods are particularly suited to problems that require screening of a big or infinite number of alternatives according to ranked criteria. However, some multi-objective optimization methods avoid the use of explicit trade-offs by using a ranking of factors. This does not create transparency when comparing a small number of alternatives with known attributes. (2) Value-based methods are widely used in building design practice and literature. However, such methods (e. g., AHP and WRC) may not help in creating transparency, building consensus, and continuous learning for group decision making. This is because they (a) may assume that factors have zero as a natural scale, (b) may assume that trade-offs between factors are linear functions, (c) may not differentiate between alternatives, (d) may be inconsistent when irrelevant factors are removed, (e) may mix `value' and cost, (f) may require conflicting judgments for weighting factors, and (g) may lack support for context-based analysis. (3) Outranking methods are hard to apply to this problem since they lack an aggregation function, which makes it impossible to rank alternatives and evaluate `value' vs. cost. Even when these methods focus more on the differences between the alternatives than value-based methods do, they also require decision makers to weigh factors and attributes in order to build outranking relations. (4) CBA focuses more on differentiating between alternatives, and better guides the design team to understand `value' vs. cost compared to the other MCDM methods studied. In addition, CBA avoids assuming that every increment in performance is equally valuable or that trade-offs between factors are linear. After comparing the methods, this research proposes the use of Choosing By Advantages (CBA) to overcome the deficiencies of the value-based methods in regards to creating transparency, building consensus, and continuous learning in the design process. The researcher further tested CBA in three case studies for different applications in architecture and engineering firms in the San Francisco Bay Area. This work contributes to knowledge by providing: (1) A theoretical evaluation of the four types of MCDM methods being studied and illustrating relevant differences between them; (2) A practical evaluation of CBA vs. AHP and CBA vs. WRC presenting factors and criteria for evaluating their ability to assist practitioners in deciding which alternative is more sustainable in commercial building design; (3) A rationale for recommending the CBA method in the research context; and (4) An analysis of the application of CBA for different types of decisions. In addition, this research discusses: (5) How sustainable rating systems (e. g., LEED) affect decisions; (6) How cognitive biases may apply to group decision making in this context and how they may be overcome; and (7) How rhetoric can support the CBA application. Through these seven areas of contribution, the presented research provides a basis for discussing MCDM method selection in commercial building design that may be expanded to other applications, and for advancing our understanding of the relationship between decision-making methods and building outcomes...|$|E

The value is in the idea of preferences being social in nature and in the application both <b>to</b> the <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> of the organisation and its impacts on people outside. Using the concept of "strategic failure" we suggest that social preferences reflected in deliberative social praxis can reduce false beliefs and increase individual wellbeing. From this approach, the paper offers a taxonomy of production organizations, based on social preferences about two variables: (i) the governance form (i. e. ownership and control rights) (ii) other strategic decisions that characterize the management of a company at a more operational level, once its fundamental legal form has been chosen. Each dimension (governance and strategic decisions processes) is then categorised alongside two basic preferences: towards inclusion or exclusion of "publics" that have no substantial access to decision power about these variables. Our framework explains governance heterogeneity by contrasting exclusive and inclusive social preferences in cooperatives, social enterprises, as well as traditional corporations.

Claiming that Culture remains the dominating factor in preventing the establishment of shared governance mechanisms, this thesis concludes by making a variety of policy and practice recommendations ranging from regulatory changes to the entire system, to obtaining specific external audits and to establishing certain committee structures <b>to</b> increase <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> participation, as well as creating a culture that balances collegiality and corporate practices by placing individuals with skills in both modes of thinking to key nodes of governance.

Sustainability reporting also allows an organisation to communicate its vision, goals and strategic plans. In order to be strategic towards sustainability, an organisation should have a vision of where it wants to go, and assess where it is today, so as to take the right initiatives towards its vision. This thesis focuses on how GRI sustainability reporting and strategic planning towards sustainability can be combined in an integrated process to help organisations move towards sustainability. The Integrated Process allows an organisation {{to gain a better}} understanding of its sustainability context; design resilient strategies in light of that context using a backcasting from Sustainability Principles approach; and report its sustainability performance and progress in bridging the gap towards sustainability, transparently <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> and external <b>stakeholders...</b>|$|R

Students and academic staff are part of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and they participate in university governance by collective bodies such as universities senate and faculty councils. At present, the management and governance of the universities become complex and often there are divergent interests between external and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> New trends in organization of the management structures of universities prefigure {{the end of the}} democratic decision- making tradition in universities replacing it with management structures similar to market- based institutions or commercial companies. This change will strongly affect the traditional participatory institutional democracy of European universities. The aim is to maintain a balance between the <b>internal</b> and external <b>stakeholders.</b> This paper seeks to analyze the various factors influencing the power of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> in the countries that participate in the EUROAC Survey from an international comparative perspective. In the present situation, when almost all <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> in the participating countries of the EUROAC Survey are loosing their power, it becomes necessary for us to discuss the problem from an international perspective. More specifically, the focus will be on the following topics: (1) internal decision making; (2) the role of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> in university governance process; and (3) junior-senior relation...|$|R

Based on data from Shanghai A-share companies for the period 2008 to 2011, we differentiated the effects amongdifferent groups of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> Our results show thatshareholding ratio of the top ten major shareholdersandthe number of corporate employeespositively affectsenvironmental performance information disclosure (EPID) significantly, and institutional shareholding ratio negatively affects environmental performance information disclosure significantly. We do not find shareholding ratios of small and medium-sizedinvestors, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII) and B-share investors affect EPID significantly. Our results suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> do affectenvironmental performance information disclosure, but the extent varies depending on specific groups of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders...</b>|$|R

40|$|A vast {{proportion}} of companies nowadays {{are looking to}} design and are focusing on the end users {{as a means of}} driving new projects. However still many companies are drawn to technological improvements which drive innovation within their industry context. The Australian livestock industry is no different. To date the adoption of new products and services within the livestock industry has been documented as being quite slow. This paper investigates how disruptive innovation should be a priority for these technologically focused companies and demonstrates how the use of design led innovation can bring about a higher quality engagement between end user and company alike. A case study linking participatory design and design thinking is presented. Within this, a conceptual model of presenting future scenarios <b>to</b> <b>internal</b> and external <b>stakeholders</b> is applied to the livestock industry; assisting companies to apply strategy, culture and advancement in meaningful product offerings to consumers...|$|R
