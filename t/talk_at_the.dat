In 1979 his <b>talk</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> RSA entitled Design and its Use by Managers provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, and {{an appreciation of the}} power of design as a management resource. Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design Management Unit at LBS, Design Talks (1988) with Eric Schneider and Design Management: Papers from the London Business School (1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design, design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).|$|E
