40|$|The {{threat of}} another major {{terrorist}} {{attack in the}} United States remains high, with the greatest danger coming from local extremists inspired by events in the Middle East. Although the United States removed the <b>Taliban</b> government <b>and</b> destroyed <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda’s</b> training camps in Afghanistan, events in Europe and elsewhere {{have shown that the}} terrorist network leadership remains determined to carry out further attacks and is capable of doing so. Therefore, the United States must systematically conduct research on terrorist strikes against transportation targets to distill lessons learned and determine the best practices for deterrence, response, and recovery. Those best practices must be taught to transportation and security professionals to provide secureÂ surface transportation for the nation. Studying recent incidents in Europe and Asia, along with other research, will help leaders in the United States learn valuable lessons—from preventing attacks, to response and recovery, to addressing the psychological impacts of attacks to business continuity. Timely distillations of the lessons learned and best practices developed in other countries, once distributed to law enforcement, first responders, and rail- and subway-operating transit agencies, could result in the saving of American lives. This monograph focuses on the terrorist risks confronting public transportation in the United States—especially urban mass transit—and explores how different forms of passenger screening, and in particular, selective screening, can best be implemented to reduce those risks...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This thesis {{describes}} and explains the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) with special reference to Turkey’s leadership.

After the U.

As a part of the UN state-building activities in Afghanistan, to assist the Afghan authorities in the maintenance of security in Kabul and surrounding areas, the UN Security Council authorized ISAF, initially led by Great Britain. After September 11, Turkey {{emerged as one of the}} leading actors in the fight against terrorism and she, being a country that suffered from terrorism for years, supported fully all the counter-terrorism activities. Turkey actively participated in ISAF, and when the British mandate was over, she took over the command of ISAF. Turkey was a perfect choice to lead ISAF since she had an Islamic population with a secular and democratic government and was one of the few countries whose forces were capable of coping with this kind of mission. By assuming the command of ISAF, Turkey has demonstrated her determination to fight against terrorism once more.

40|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11 th the United States invaded Afghanistan <b>and</b> overthrew the <b>Taliban</b> in a quick and decisive war, effectively destroying {{the terrorist}} safe haven in the country. However, eight years later the U. S. and members of the international community remain there trying to keep terrorists and extremists from reestablishing their base in Afghanistan. To date we have only reached a fragile stalemate between the insurgency, composed of the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> supported by <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> <b>and</b> the ISAF and U. S. forces within the country. Many argue we should give up in Afghanistan, believing our problems can be attributed to a poor strategy, a lack of resources, a lack of focus, or simply an unwinnable war. However, we now have a new President, a new commander in Afghanistan, and a new strategy that many have touted as a first step toward victory. This thesis examines the history of the battle for stability in Afghanistan, the history of insurgencies in the country, and other major issues challenging the rebuilding and stability of the failed state. The intent of this thesis is to contribute a further understanding of the conflict and challenges present in Afghanistan and its surrounding region. The effectiveness of the Obama administration's new strategy and direction in Afghanistan is also examined. While the new strategy is a step forward in Afghanistan, it is far from a silver bullet. Any victory still requires a true long-term commitment to the fight for stability in Afghanistan, the proper resources for the security of the Afghan people and an effective effort to eliminate the safe haven that now exists in Pakistan. Significant progress is achievable within the region. However, even if the Obama plan works as outlined true stability and success will not occur unless the U. S. and members of the international community avoid past mistakes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), {{one of the}} three key Islamic groups active in Central Asia. The IMU is a militant and extremist Islamic organization, one that has been listed by the US State Department as a terrorist organization. It has been linked to terrorist activity and to the attempted overthrow of Uzbek President Islam Karimov. This paper discusses the roots and causes of Islamic radicalism in general; clarifies the terms "Salafism" and "Wahhabism"; and examines violence as culture. In discussing the emergence of radical Islam (Islamism) in Uzbekistan, the author covers Salafism in Central Asia; the early Salafi ideologists; specific teachers and their disciples; and Uzbek militants abroad, in such places as Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In describing the rise of the IMU, the paper presents the IMU's early activities; the February 1999 terrorist bombings in Tashkent; terrorist networks in Central Asia; the conviction {{of the leaders of the}} Erk political party for terrorist acts; and regional and clan rivalries. In discussing trans-border violence, the paper covers the fighting in Tajikistan in 1999; the hostage taking in Kyrgyzstan in 1999; and the IMU's adventures in Tajikistan and Afghanistan in 1999 - 2000. The author goes on to discuss the ideology of the IMU, first reviewing the roots of radical Islamic organizations in the Ferghana Valley and then examining "Lessons of Jihad," which is reportedly a document of the IMU that discusses the stages and objectives of jihad. The author then discusses the IMU after September 11, 2001, including its possible connections to the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> to the <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> network. This analysis of the IMU concludes with a number of empirical and theoretical insights into the nature of organized extremism in Central Asia: that Islamic militancy is likely to persist in Central Asia; how no single theory is satisfactory to explain the phenomenon; how external factors play a role in Islamist mobilization in the region; how organized crime and political extremism are essential components for these groups; how Uzbek President Karimov's repression of ordinary Muslims is counterproductive in the struggle against Islamists; and finally, that printed materials are not of primary importance in the recruitment of members of supporters...|$|R
