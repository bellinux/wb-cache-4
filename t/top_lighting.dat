50|$|This {{film was}} not a {{collaboration}} between Tilby and Forbis, it was only worked on by Tilby. The animation style used is reminiscent of Caroline Leaf's method of painting on frosted glass, used in her 1976 short film, The Street. However, Tilby used bottom-lighting in her film, instead of <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> like Caroline Leaf. She used an animation camera apparatus and worked directly under the camera, she applied, moved, and removed the colored paints on the glass until the frame was finished. When the frame was complete she took two frames worth of footage from the overhead camera. Then she would modify the image to make the next frame, and repeat the process. To make details on the characters' faces and in their body language Tilby used a stylus and scratched details into the paint. She also used her fingers, q-tips, and tissues to move the paint around the glass and change the scene. Tilby enjoys using this method because the artist erases the previous work as they go, and it forces her not to dwell on what she has already shot and keep going with the filming.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} light {{attenuation}} and canopy photosynthesis suggest that crop photosynthesis increases by more uniform vertical irradiance within crops. This would result when a {{larger proportion of}} total irradiance is applied within canopies (interlighting) instead of from above (<b>top</b> <b>lighting).</b> These irradiance profiles can be generated by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). We investigated the effects of interlighting with LEDs on light interception, on vertical gradients of leaf photosynthetic characteristics and on crop production and development of a greenhouse-grown Cucumis sativus'Samona' crop and analysed the interaction between them. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under low natural irradiance (winter) with supplemental irradiance of 221 micromol photosynthetic photon flux m(- 2) s(- 1) (20 h per day). In the interlighting treatment, LEDs (80 % Red, 20 % Blue) supplied 38 % of the supplemental irradiance within the canopy with 62 % as <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> by High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) -lamps. The control was 100 % <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> (HPS lamps). We measured horizontal and vertical light extinction as well as leaf photosynthetic characteristics at different leaf layers, and determined total plant production. Leaf mass per area and dry mass allocation to leaves were significantly greater but leaf appearance rate and plant length were smaller in the interlighting treatment. Although leaf photosynthetic characteristics were significantly increased in the lower leaf layers, interlighting did not increase total biomass or fruit production, partly because of a significantly reduced vertical and horizontal light interception caused by extreme leaf curling, likely because of the LED-light spectrum used, and partly because of the relatively low irradiances from abov...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{the use of}} {{electricity}} for assimilation lighting has increased considerably. It is now {{an important part of}} the energy use of the horticultural sector. To reverse this trend, in the lighting season 2013 / 2014, we conducted a trial with the aim to reduce the electricity use in a lighted tomato crop by 35 % while maintaining production levels. Two treatments were applied: (1) Reference cultivation: clear glass and lighting by 50 % HPS lamps and 50 % LED intermittent lighting (210 µmol/m 2 /s), (2) energy efficient cultivation: diffuse greenhouse cover and lighting by 50 % LED <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> and 50 % intermittent LED lighting (210 µmol/m 2 /s). In the energy efficient cultivation, 37 % less electricity was used in the period October - May. However, energy use for heating in this treatment was higher to compensate for the lack of radiative heat. The light sum the plants received (sunlight + artificial lighting) was 6 % lower in the energy efficient cultivation compared to the reference cultivation due to the lower number of lighting hours. However, the production difference was only 0. 3 kg/m 2, less than 1 %! Detailed plant measurements showed hardly any differences between the treatments in light interception, light absorption by the leaves, photosynthesis and the production and distribution of assimilates. The analysis of the crop growth model showed that the effect of the lower number of lighting hours in the energy efficient cultivation was fully compensated by the positive effects of the diffuse greenhouse cover which has a higher light transmission...|$|E
40|$|Key words: Cucumis sativus, intracanopy lighting, {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs), light distribution, light interception, light quality, photosynthesis, photosynthetic acclimation Assimilation lighting is a production factor of increasing importance in Dutch greenhouse horticulture. Assimilation lighting increases production levels, improves product quality and opens possibilities for year round production. As a drawback, {{this use of}} assimilation lighting increases energy inputs and CO 2 -emission. Intracanopy lighting (with LEDs) is a technique to enhance the light use efficiency by changing the position of (a part of) the lamps from above to within the canopy of greenhouse grown crops. Intracanopy lighting (IL) firstly reduces reflection and transmission losses of the supplemental lighting on crop level. These losses are high in traditional top-lighting systems, hence IL yields a higher light absorption on crop level. Secondly, IL creates a more homogenous vertical light distribution which can result in higher light use efficiencies. The aim of {{present study was to}} obtain insights in photosynthetic acclimation in response to irradiance level and spectrum in the framework of the applicability of LEDs as light source for intracanopy lighting in indeterminate growing vegetable crops. Intracanopy lighting may vary in (1) position within the crop, in (2) irradiance level and in (3) spectrum. Leaves deeper in the canopy are older. If leaf age negatively affects the photosynthetic capacity (Amax), then potential positions of IL-lamps reduce. By growing tomato plants horizontally so that irradiance was similar for all leaves from 0 - 70 days old, it is concluded that during the normal life-span of tomato leaves in cultivation, irradiance and not ageing is the most important factor affecting Amax. In winter, natural irradiances are low so that new developing leaves acclimate to low irradiances. Later on in their life time these leaves could be exposed to higher irradiances owing to IL. The question arose if cucumber leaves which develop under low irradiance can acclimate to a moderate irradiance. Acclimation of photosynthesis occurred within 7 days but photosynthesis at moderate irradiance and Amax did not reach to that of leaves developed under moderate irradiance. This reveals the importance of photosynthetic acclimation during the leaf developmental phase for crop productivity in scenarios with realistic, moderate fluctuations in irradiance that leaves can be exposed to. By growing plants under seven different combinations of red and blue light, blue light is shown to have both a qualitative and a quantitative effect on leaf development. Only leaves developed under red light (0 % blue) displayed a dysfunctional photosynthetic operation (“red light syndrome”), which was largely alleviated by only 7 % blue. Quantitatively, leaf responses to an increasing blue light percentage resembled responses associated with an increase in irradiance. Leaves developed under red light exposed to a mixture of red and blue (RB) completely recovered within 4 days after exposure to RB-light but remained limited in other leaf parameters, showing limitations in plasticity due to constraints arising from the prior leaf development. Leaves developed under RB also revealed the “red light syndrome” within 7 days of red illumination. Lastly, the effects of intracanopy lighting with LEDs on the production and development of a cucumber crop was investigated in winter. In the IL-treatment, LEDs supplied 38 % of the supplemental irradiance within the canopy; the remaining 62 % was supplied as <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> by High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps. The control was 100 % <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> (HPS lamps). Intracanopy lighting resulted in a greater Amax for leaves at deeper canopy layers but did not increase total biomass or fruit production. This was partly due to a reduced light interception caused by extreme leaf curling, which counteracted the expected higher light absorption by the crop, and partly to a lower dry matter partitioning to the fruits, and thus a greater dry matter partitioning to the leaves compared to the control. The effect of these factors on fruit yield was quantified using a explanatory crop model. Model calculations revealed a large negative effect on the fruit yield due to the greater partitioning to the leaves, whereas the negative effect of leaf curling was small. The effect of a greater Amax at deeper canopy layers was slightly positive. The last however might have indirectly caused the greater partitioning to the leaves as the greater Amax was associated with a preserved leaf mass per area.  ...|$|E
40|$|The use of LEDs can be {{promising}} for greenhouse horticulture, {{but before}} it can be put into practice on a large scale more knowledge must be acquired on effects of LED lighting on crops. Furthermore, the growers will have to learn to grow their crops under LEDs and the efficiency of LEDs must increase even more. In order to gain more insight into the influence of LEDs on crop growth and production, an experiment was performed in the Wageningen UR greenhouses with a small Santa type tomato (‘Sunstream’) from October 2009 to June 2010. Four lighting treatments were applied, with each treatment in a separate greenhouse compartment: <b>top</b> <b>lighting</b> with HPS (1) or LED (2), and hybrid lighting with HPS above the crop in combination with LED lighting above the crop (3) or in between the canopy (interlighting) (4). The light intensity from the lamps in all treatments was maintained at 170 µmol m- 2 s- 1. The light was 50 / 50 divided between HPS and LED in the hybrid treatments. The climate in each treatment was adapted {{to the needs of the}} crop in each lighting system. The various lighting systems resulted in different greenhouse climates, in which more heating was required in the LED treatment and the least heating in the hybrid with interlighting. A strong crop developed under LED alone, and to maintain a proper crop balance the fruit load was altered by maintaining an extra tomato fruit per truss and increasing the stem density relative to that under HPS. The leaves of tomato grown under HPS were thinner and aged more rapidly in the winter than in the other treatments. Leaves lower in the canopy under LED alone or hybrid treatments had a higher photosynthesis capacity in the winter than leaves developed under HPS lighting. Differences in production were small, although the production under all LEDs was lower. There were only small differences in fruit quality. The amount of energy required per kilogram tomato was highest in the LED treatment and hybrid with top LED lighting. This was primarily due to the fact that a higher air temperature was necessary and these LEDs were cooled and the cost of cooling added to the use of energy. The consequences and future perspectives of the different types of supplementary lighting for crop growth and production as well as for crop management practices will be discussed...|$|E
