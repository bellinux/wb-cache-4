Ramiro Burr of Billboard magazine believed that the song could have easily been successful in European clubs thanks to its striking resemblance to Euro-pop and Eurodance songs that were popular in Europe at the time. Tom Whitehurst Jr. of the Corpus Christi Caller Times wrote {{that he did not know}} what [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] meant but, after a friend played him a tape of the recording, he became a fan of the singer. Andrew Mitchell, also from the Corpus Christi Caller Times, called the song [...] "happy" [...] and said that it was [...] "only natural <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the meaning of , not just memorize [...] lyrics to sing along.

Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", [...] "No Me Queda Más", and [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] the [...] "key hits of [...] ".

But then it withers away rapidly, which is a comfort. One evening we were sitting, rather disconsolately, in our room, and I was reading out the advertisements of country board in a newspaper, when in rushed Dr. Heare--one of our old friends. He was so full of something that he had to say that he didn't even ask us how we were. In fact, he didn't appear <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E

Yours is a very good-looking face, William, but it's so infernally honest that I can't trust it in the tap-room. I'm making friends with the Scotchmen already.

6000|$|There {{was always}} a run of reporters at Mark Twain's New York home. [...] His opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest, and [...] {{whatever}} happened to him in particular was considered good for at [...] least half a column of copy, with his name as a catch-line at the [...] top. When it was learned {{that he was to}} spend the summer in New [...] Hampshire, the reporters had all wanted to find out about it. Now [...] that the summer was ending, they began <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how he had [...] liked it, what work he had done and what were his plans for another [...] year. As they frequently applied to his publishers for these [...] details it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter [...] furnishing the required information.

60|$|Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly {{got to the}} Surrey side of Westminster Bridge, {{and crossed}} the bridge, and made along the Middlesex shore towards Millbank. In this region are a certain little street called Church Street, and a certain little blind square, called Smith Square, in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners, {{generally}} resembling some petrified monster, frightful and gigantic, on its back with its legs in the air. They found a tree near by in a corner, and a blacksmith's forge, and a timber yard, and a dealer's in old iron. What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer's fore-court, nobody seemed to know or <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song, They cared for Nobody, no not they, and Nobody cared for them.|$|E
