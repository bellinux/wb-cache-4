5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift {{the outcome of the}} battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E

In 1957, a brewer was recruited to develop a local beer. After developing 17 different recipes, he travelled throughout the island to test each one using primarily local ingredient; <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was a pilsener chosen as the recipe to be produced at a Star brewery to be established in Antsirabe.

Fittipaldi finished the year with 17 points and the team, now known as Fittipaldi Automotive, came 7th in the Constructor's table – one place ahead of Emerson's old team McLaren.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of Preece's matches for Worcestershire came in {{the period}} between 1920 and 1924. Although he played quite {{regularly}} during this period, he never had more than moderate success, his highest season's aggregate of wickets being 42 (at 30.11) in 1920. He claimed five wickets in an innings on four occasions, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> being the 7-35 he achieved against Essex at Leyton in 1921. It was to prove in vain, however: Essex, having been bowled out for 90 in their first innings, reached 560 in their second and won by 132 runs.|$|E

25|$|Other wartime entries {{have their}} moments, such as They Stooge to Conga ({{considered}} {{the most violent}} Stooge short), Higher Than a Kite, Back From the Front (all 1943), Gents Without Cents (1944) and the anti-Japanese The Yoke's on Me (also 1944). However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are decidedly substandard. No Dough Boys (again 1944) is often considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader (Vernon Dent, the Stooges' primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in nonsensical gymnastics (the real spies are renowned acrobats) for a skeptical group of enemy agents.|$|E
25|$|His {{first-class}} debut {{followed in}} the 1988 County Championship against Somerset, with his List A debut also coming in 1988 against the same opposition in the Refuge Assurance League. Clarke played 3 seasons for Sussex, appearing regularly in the Sussex team for first-class matches, before falling out of favour during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He did though make a total of 26 first-class appearances in the 2 seasons in which he appeared in first-class cricket, with 21 coming in his debut season. A tailender, Clarke scored 406 runs at a batting average of 14.50. He scored a single half century, making 68 against in a rearguard action against Hampshire in 1988. Clarkes primary role was as a bowler, with Clarke taking 53 first-class wickets, at a respectable bowling average of 35.32. He twice took a five wicket haul, with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> coming against Hampshire in 1988, the match in which his highest score with the bat came.|$|E
25|$|After {{suppressing the}} Bar Kochba revolt, the Romans exiled the Jews of Judea, {{but not of}} Galilee and {{permitted}} a hereditary Rabbinical Patriarch (from the House of Hillel, based in Galilee) to represent the Jews in dealings with the Romans. The most famous of these was Judah haNasi who is credited with compiling {{the final version of}} the Mishnah (a massive body of Jewish religious texts interpreting the Bible) and with strengthening the educational demands of Judaism by requiring that illiterate Jews be treated as outcasts. As a result, many illiterate Jews may have converted to Christianity. Jewish seminaries, such as those at Shefaram and Bet Shearim continued to produce scholars and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> became members of the Sanhedrin, which was located first at Tzippori and later at Tiberias. Before the Bar-Kochba uprising, an estimated 2/3 of the population of Gallilee and 1/3 of the coastal region were Jewish. In the Galillee, many Synagogues have been found dating from this period. However, persecution and the economic crisis that affected the Roman empire in the 3rd century led to further Jewish migration from Syria Palaestina to the more tolerant Persian Sassanid Empire, where a prosperous Jewish community with extensive seminaries existed in the area of Babylon.|$|E

25|$|Nottinghamshire, captained for {{the first}} time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to {{retirement}} and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.|$|E
500|$|In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, {{starting}} {{a period where}} natural sciences were esteemed.

Linnaeus called <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> students his [...] "apostles". His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.|$|E

[...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

During the voyage to New Zealand, the improvers received further instruction and were tested by having to prepare draft layouts for the new settlement, Brunner's plan being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> [...] On 18 September, the Whitby arrived at Port Nicholson, the New Zealand Company's first settlement. [...] The approximate site for the new settlement {{had yet to be}} finalised; initially intended for Banks Peninsula, this location was vetoed by the Governor of New Zealand, William Hobson. Instead, it was to be located {{at the top of the}} South Island, at Tasman Bay. Early the following month a convoy of the company's ships, with Brunner aboard one them, crossed the Cook Strait to Tasman Bay. After scouting the area for three weeks, a site adjacent a deep and sheltered natural harbour was identified as being suitable for the settlement.|$|E
500|$|Gernsback's {{declared}} {{goals for}} Amazing were {{to educate and}} to entertain. [...] In the editorial for the first issue he asserted that [...] "Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading – they are also always instructive.

[...] For <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us aware that we are being taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing. [...] The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply [...] "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".|$|E

[...] Upon payment of a subscription, members would be given a gilt Eagle badge, a rulebook, {{and a list of}} privileges. [...] The club proved extremely popular, attracting within months a membership of about 100,000, but it also served as a research tool for Hulton; questionnaires were sent to a random selection of members, asking each to rate certain aspects of the comic. [...] Eagles production costs were funded partly by advertising revenue, although advertisers were required to integrate their designs so as to match the comic's high standards. [...] Another of Hampson's strips, Tommy Walls, was the first commercial cartoon in any comic, and an obvious advertisement for Wall's ice cream. [...] Eagle also spawned a large range of merchandise, which included toothpaste, pyjamas, and toy ray guns. [...] Several annuals were printed; the first was announced in a September 1951 issue, in Morris's regular letter to his readers.|$|E
