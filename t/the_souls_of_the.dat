Realizing that this would result in Serah never being reborn, Lightning decides to stop the ritual, though Cid warns her {{that she will be}} defying Bhunivelze's will.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good ending {{and a bad}} ending.

5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a near-death {{experience}} and {{is sent to}} the Klingon version of Hell known as Gre'thor. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the Voyager crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths {{she did not see}} before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could be said for <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, both living and dead.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizenry.|$|E
5|$|Underground Egyptian tombs {{built in}} the desert provide {{possibly}} the most protective environment {{for the preservation of}} papyrus documents. For example, there are many well-preserved Book of the Dead funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased tomb occupants. However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.|$|E

5|$|A {{second season}} of episodic video games {{developed}} by Telltale Games {{was announced in}} July 2007. Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space followed the same overall format as Save the World, with each episode having a contained storyline with an overarching storyline involving laundering of <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. As with Save the World, episodes were originally published on GameTap before being made available for general release. The season consisted of five episodes and ran from November 2007 to April 2008. Nowlin and Kasten both returned to reprise their voice roles. In addition to the main games, a twenty-minute machinima video was produced, taking {{the form of a}} Sam & Max Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knights are freed from their torment, {{and the people}} celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|An evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to {{take over}} the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds. In reality however, Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king {{choosing}} to cover it up and declare Dan a hero. Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.|$|E

Emperor Diaz then reveals himself to be Zieg Feld, Dart's father and leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragoons that fought alongside Rose in the Dragon Campaign. After Zieg defeated Melbu Frahma, Melbu cast a spell that both petrified him and kept Melbu's spirit alive within Zieg's body.

5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to {{take place on the}} final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the account was Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native peoples. The account {{was one of the}} first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that the indigenous people endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|E
