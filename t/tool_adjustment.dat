40|$|Face {{turning of}} optical {{surfaces}} on precision lathes needs high precision tool height adjustment, {{which may be}} a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper we present a new <b>tool</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism based on varying the bearing gap height of the hydrostatic bearings present in precision lathe slides. Slide height variation is realised by influencing the flow to the bearing chambers. This is obtained by adding adjustable restrictions into the oil supply tubes. The bearing stiffness change is limited and stays high in comparison with other machine elements. The realised system has a fine adjustment range of 20 urn, a resolution better than 0. 1 µm and a repeatability error lower than 0. 1 µm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} two common {{concepts}} of the natural rate of unemployment: (i) the stable, long-run equilibrium rate of unemployment; and (ii) the equilibrium unemployment rate at {{which there is no}} tendency for this rate to change, given the exogenous variables. The first concept (common in the theoretical literature) is impractical for empirical assessment, since it is generally impossible to find reliable estimates of the long-run values of the exogenous variables and since it is inherently unable to provide an analysis of how the NRU changes through time. Consequently, the second concept is used in empirical studies. The paper shows that this latter natural rate is not necessarily a reference point (a value towards which the equilibrium unemployment rate tends with the passage of time). Specifically, it is not a reference point in multi-equation labour market models containing lagged endogenous variables and exogenous variables with non-zero long-run growth rates. Since these features are exceedingly common, our analysis casts serious doubts on the usefulness of the natural rate hypothesis as a predictive <b>tool.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Costs; Capital Accumulation; Employment; Labour Markets; Natural Rate Hypothesis; Population Growth; Unemployment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six optimization models {{which are}} developed and solved in two stages {{in order to}} integrate tolerancing and machining parameters decisions. One model is developed in the first stage. The first-stage model is related to a design problem and provides better part tolerance {{to be used in}} the second stage to incorporate <b>tool</b> <b>adjustment</b> decisions into the optimization of machining parameters. Five models are developed in the second stage and are divided into single-machine and multi-machine turning operation problems. For single-machine turning operations, three models are formulated. The first is a single-product multi-pass model considering pass selection for determining optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, dimension deviation and number of passes. The second is a single-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs to find optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, dimension deviation and batch size. The third is a multi-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs for selection of optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, dimension deviations and production cycle time. For multi-machine turning operations, two models are formulated. One is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing total cost for determining optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. The second is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing cycle time which, once solved, will give optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. A solution method and illustrative examples are given to test the feasibility of the developed optimization models. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} to minimize the number of process <b>tooling</b> <b>adjustments</b> and deliver an acceptable fraction of non-conforming products based on given product quality specification limits in assembly processes. A linear model is developed to describe the relationships between product quality and process tooling locating positions. Based on the model, the process mean shifts of tooling locating positions are estimated for both deterministic and stochastic cases by using the least-square estimation or linear mixed model estimation, respectively. A simultaneous confidence interval is obtained to construct the estimation region of a process mean shift under the given false alarm rate. Furthermore, a <b>tooling</b> <b>adjustment</b> strategy is proposed to determine when the process adjustment is essentially {{needed in order to}} ensure an acceptable fraction of non-conforming units based on the given product quality specification limits. Finally, a case study is conducted to illustrate the developed methodology by using a real-world autobody assembly process. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|COSMIC method defines principles, {{rules and}} the process of {{standard}} functional size measurement. Method implementation in Agile projects will help forecasting the completion time for a specific task in the early planning stages. Inaccurate task capacity estimation in the planning stage can become a serious problem which in turn may lead to not being able to complete parts of the assignment or even the whole project. User stories are being evaluated as SP which are not converted into a timescale which further complicates accurate job receptivity in the early project and task planning stage. Within this paper a detailed COSMIC method analysis is being performed as well as a review of existing Agile project tools. Also making sure that there are no other tools which allow the forecast of user story completion time by merging COSMIC with task completion time history log. To complete the goals of this paper a three part experimental survey took place which determined that the consolidation of the COSMIC method with the task completion time history may result in a similar or even more accurate forecast as compared to the forecast of a team of software developers.

40|$|The {{population}} pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus {{was described}} in 22 pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and a model-based dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> that may assist with therapy in new patients was developed. Patients received tacrolimus by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion (0. 03 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1)) starting. 2 days before transplantation, with conversion to oral therapy 2 - 3 weeks after transplant. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM. A Bayesian dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> that searches for individual parameter estimates to describe concentration measurements, counterbalanced by the final population model, was created in Excel. Typical clearance was 106 mL. h(- 1). kg(- 0. 75), typical distribution volume was 3. 71 L/kg, and typical bioavailability was 15. 7 %. Tacrolimus clearance decreased with increasing serum creatinine, and bioavailability decreased with postoperative day. A Bayesian dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> capable of suggesting an initial infusion rate based on patient covariate values and devising a further individualized dosage regimen as drug concentration measures become available was developed. Predictions from the model showed that current IV dose recommendations of 0. 03 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) may potentially produce toxic drug concentrations in this patient population, whereas current oral conversion of 4 times the adjusted IV dose may lead to subtherapeutic concentrations. A more suitable infusion rate to obtain a steady state concentration of 12 ng/mL was predicted to be 0. 035 mg. kg(- 0. 75). d(- 1). An additional loading dose of 0. 07 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) (total dose: 0. 07 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) + 0. 035 mg. kg(- 0. 75). d(- 1)) during the first 24 hours of therapy should allow rapid achievement of steady state concentrations. A conversion factor of 6 from TV to enteric therapy may be more suitable. Such dosage recommendations may be site specific. The appropriateness of targets was not investigated in this Study.

40|$|Flexible blade cutting applied on thick {{layers of}} foam is very {{feasible}} for creating large sized physical models. The heated tool is set {{and moved in}} a circumferential tool motion along the front face of the layer. During these primary motions the cutting tool is positioned {{in order to ensure}} the best tool position and tool orientation for the cutting process. The <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>tool</b> position and tool orientation will introduce speed components, which will affect the cutting process. The principle of FF-TLOM cutting is to manufacture a foam layer under precise speed control. For a successful cutting process it is needed to check that no part of the cutting blade exceeds the maximum and/or minimum speed as defined for the FF-TLOM process. In this paper the secondary <b>tool</b> <b>adjustments,</b> like change in pitch, roll and yaw, are explored and the impact on the speed control is defined. The influence is first elaborated for the case of a straight cutting blade. Then the effects of a deflected or curved blade are estimated. A separation is made in a speed component along the depth of the blade and perpendicular to the blade. The speed control is influenced by an amount of parameters, making the cutting process very complex. The paper does not provide an applicable method of speed control, {{more research is needed to}} implement the adjustments into an optimized calculation method...|$|R
