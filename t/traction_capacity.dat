In this work we present a method to determine an optimal flow of loaded and empty cars in order to maximize profits, revenue or tonnage transported, given the schedule of the trains, together with their <b>traction</b> <b>capacities.</b> We propose an integer multicommodity flow model for the problem whose linear relaxation leads to very good upper bounds [...] at the cost of using {{a very large number of}} variables and constraints. In order to turn this model into a practical tool, we apply a preprocessing phase that may reduce its size by two or three orders of magnitude. The reduced model can then be solved by standard integer program packages with little, if any, branching effort.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} screw drive in-pipe robots cannot actively adjust the maximum <b>traction</b> <b>capacity,</b> which limits the adaptability to {{the wide range of}} variable environment resistance, especially in curved pipes. In order to solve this problem, a screw drive in-pipe robot based on adaptive linkage mechanism is proposed. The differential property of the adaptive linkage mechanism allows the robot to move without motion interference in the straight and varied curved pipes by adjusting inclining angles of rollers self-adaptively. The maximum <b>traction</b> <b>capacity</b> of the robot can be changed by actively adjusting the inclining angles of rollers. In order to improve the adaptability to the variable resistance, a torque control method based on the fuzzy controller is proposed. For the variable environment resistance, the proposed control method can not only ensure enough traction force, but also limit the output torque in a feasible region. In the simulations, the robot with the proposed control method is compared to the robot with fixed inclining angles of rollers. The results show that the combination of the torque control method and the proposed robot achieves the better adaptability to the variable resistance in the straight and curved pipes...|$|E
40|$|The Milner {{continuously}} variable transmission (MCVT) is a transmission device based on rolling contacts analogous {{to those found in}} an angular contact roller bearing. The MCVT is particularly applicable to very high power density applications or those with very demanding packaging constraints, due primarily to the existence of multiple traction contacts on each of the rolling elements. Initial testing of a 12 kW MCVT prototype was undertaken in 1999 with promising results [1]. This lead to the further development and testing of a 2 nd prototype MCVT rated to 60 kW, however the design target of this device was not achieved and performance was hampered by a loss of <b>traction</b> <b>capacity</b> compared to the design specification. The work presented in this paper highlights work undertaken on a full dynamic simulation and analysis of the MCVT and identifies the failure mode of the 2 nd MCVT prototype and as a result a redesign of this device has been undertaken such that it can obtain its original design targets...|$|E
30|$|With a reactor {{in series}} with the feeder of a {{traction}} substation, the traction loads in a traction network can be redistributed based on the impedance proportion in each of substations. By doing so, the <b>traction</b> substation <b>capacities</b> along the line can be optimized according to {{the distribution of the}} power system capacity, and the TT load rate can be improved. At the same time, the short-circuit current will be decreased and its impacts on the TT, breaker, and other devices will be reduced. Thus, selection of circuit breaker, and cut-off of faults will be easier, and the operational reliability will be higher.|$|R

Energy consumption and CO 2 -emission based on the actual standard test cycles (NEFZ, CADC) is much too optimistic, especially for rural operation in mountainous regions. In this contribution we present a Simulink-based electric vehicle model that considers all relevant route characteristics (altitude, speed limit, pavement and weather conditions). The model is applied and validated by different electric compact cars and roadsters with real mountainous test cycles. Based on intensive parameter studies with this model, a simplified analytical model for range estimation, CO 2 -emissions and costs (including an optional fuel based range extender) is derived.

40|$|Process {{mechanization}} {{has contributed}} significantly to the increase of agricultural productivity, although the correct selection of machines must take into account a set of technical, administrative and economic parameters. Mathematical modeling of the soil and traction device interaction allows researchers and designers to analyze problems associated to traction performance in tractors and to optimize operational parameters. Mobile devices have currently dominated the technological market. Smartphones and tablets feature mobility and great processing capacity and these characteristics have favored the development and the insertion of applications in many fields.

40|$|Based on {{simulations}} of passenger transports of two representative types of metro trains in China, this study analyzes efficiencies of energy consumption and passenger transport of a metro {{train in the}} effect of its target speed, formation scale (FS) (i. e., length and mass of the formation), relative <b>traction</b> <b>capacity</b> (RTC) (i. e., ratio of the motoring cars to all its cars), and so forth. It is found that increasing energy cost efficiency of a metro train with decreasing its target speed is evidently accelerated with reducing its RTC below 0. 50 {{at the expense of}} obviously lowering its passenger transport efficiency. Moreover, if the passenger capacity of the train is sufficiently utilized, increasing its FS for the same RTC is easy to have its passenger transport efficiency improved significantly even for a meanwhile much decreased target speed with consuming energy less intensively. Therefore, metro trains in peak hours may take comparatively big FSs, relatively high target speeds, and RTCs over 0. 50 to meet usually urgent and large-scale travel demands in such time. In contrast, trains in nonpeak hours ought to have small FSs, relatively low target speeds, and RTCs smaller than 0. 50 for mainly avoiding energy waste...|$|E
40|$|Differential lock is a {{means of}} {{improving}} tractor performance. This system causes the revolution of the axles to become equal. It, improves traction, decreases abrasion of drive tires, improves fuel consumption, and increases tractor work rate. Despite advantages of the system, differential lock has not been optimized in Iran. Thus, a semi-automatic differential lock system for MF- 285 tractor was designed and developed. First of all, the different parts of the system were designed, selected, assembled. Under critical conditions, the designed system should disengage the differential lock. Critical conditions for engaging this system are: using of independent brake pedals, high forward speed, and turning the steering wheel. For sensing and measuring the critical conditions, proper sensors were selected. Output signals of these sensors were sent to a micro controller to decide the continuous engaging or disengaging. Finally, a MF- 285 tractor was equipped with the designed system. The tractor performance in primary tillage was evaluated using a mounted moldboard plow with a width of 110 cm and a working depth of 25 cm. These tests showed that unbalanced weight distribution on wheels and unequal <b>traction</b> <b>capacity</b> under drive wheels cause the slip of one wheel to be 6 percent higher thananother.

40|$|The {{increased}} interest in electrified railways {{can be explained by}} their huge capacity, high efficiency, and low pollution. Today’s electrified railway is expecting higher demands for electric power for increased speeds, increased traffic volume capacity, and heavier freight loads. This will in turn impose greater demands on railway infrastructure managers to increase the overall capacity of their railways without traffic disruption. The increasing demand for railway transportation services is having a significant effect on important stakeholder requirements, such as safety, punctuality, dependability, sustainability and costs. This in turn is affecting railway practices in the areas of operation, maintenance, and modernisation. The traction power supply system (TPSS) {{is one of the most}} important parts of the electrified railway system due to its responsibility for providing a continuous and adequate electrical power for electric railway vehicles and its great impact on the availability performance. The TPSS provides the railway with power either directly with low-frequency generators or indirectly via frequency converters (FCs). In the converter-based electrified railway network, frequency converter stations represent the generation system which converts the electric power from the three-phase 50 Hz public grid to electric power for the single-phase 16. 7 Hz traction grid. Obviously, any operational problems in the FCs will cause an unavailability of <b>traction</b> power <b>capacity</b> and consequently entail operational problems for trains, resulting in speed reduction, train delays, or cancellations. Shortages of traction power may occur due to a loss of capacity or a shortage of reserve capacity. The installed capacity should be capable of meeting the system load in the case of unexpectedly large loads, in the event of one or more FC units not being in service due to forced outages or scheduled maintenance, or when a combination of these scenarios takes place. The purpose of the research for this thesis has been to develop methodologies and tools for availability evaluation and improvement of FCs and the <b>traction</b> power <b>capacity,</b> in order to prevent and mitigate outage events through optimal decisions for improvement. To fulfil the stated purpose, empirical data have been collected from reporting databases, interviews, and documents. Examples of the data gathered are train delay statistics, failure statistics, and electrical measurements. The data have been analysed on two different levels, the FC type level and the FC station level, as well as by applying theories related to RAM analysis. The study has addressed issues regarding availability performance as follows: improvement of data reporting system planning, reliability modelling, evaluation of availability performance, and, finally, identification of effective ways to reduce shortages of traction power. The analysis outcome has revealed the areas where resources must be invested for improvement to reduce and prevent loss of load due to capacity outages.

30|$|In {{the railway}} industry, re-adhesion control plays an {{important}} role in attenuating the slip occurrence due to the low adhesion condition in the wheel–rail interaction. Braking and traction forces depend on the normal force and adhesion coefficient at the wheel–rail contact area. Due to the restrictions on controlling normal force, the only way to increase the tractive or braking effect is to maximize the adhesion coefficient. Through efficient utilization of adhesion, it is also possible to avoid wheel–rail wear and minimize the energy consumption. The adhesion between wheel and rail is a highly nonlinear function of many parameters like environmental conditions, railway vehicle speed and slip velocity. To estimate these unknown parameters accurately is a very hard and competitive challenge. The robust adaptive control strategy presented in this paper is not only able to suppress the wheel slip in time, but also maximize the adhesion utilization performance after re-adhesion process even if the wheel–rail contact mechanism exhibits significant adhesion uncertainties and/or nonlinearities. Using an optimal slip velocity seeking algorithm, the proposed strategy provides a satisfactory slip velocity tracking ability, which was demonstrated able to realize the desired slip velocity without experiencing any instability problem. The control torque of the traction motor was regulated continuously to drive the railway vehicle in the neighborhood of the optimal adhesion point and guarantee the best <b>traction</b> <b>capacity</b> after re-adhesion process by making the railway vehicle operate away from the unstable region. The results obtained from the adaptive approach based on the second-order sliding mode observer have been confirmed through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation conducted in MATLAB and Simulink with a full traction model under various wheel–rail conditions.|$|E
40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Tire-Road Friction Estimation Using Slip-based Observers (Friktionsuppskattning mellan väg och däck genom sladd-baserade observerare) In {{order to}} improve {{the security of the}} vehicles, the car industry focuses more and more on Active Safety. The objective is to introduce embedded electronic control systems to detect dangerous conditions, warn the driver and, in emergency situations, even take actions to avoid crash or at least reduce the violence of the impact. The tire-road friction coefficient which defines the maximum <b>traction</b> and braking <b>capacities</b> is very useful information for both the driver and electronic devices like ABS, ESP, roll-over prevention or collision mitigation. Unfortunately such a coefficient cannot be directly measured and has to be estimated from other available data. This thesis reviews the main directions followed by researchers around the world and then focuses on slip-based methods. The methods proposed in a few papers are implemented, compared and commented. Then some original solutions are proposed. First, a hybrid observer has been developed with the idea to classify roads into a few categories. The principle is very interesting and the implementation brings out many problems to take into consideration and some attempts of solutions. Secondly, a force observer and a tire friction model are combined. This natural approach works well in simulations...|$|R
40|$|Range extenders are a {{solution}} to partly overcome the limitations of current battery technology and are gaining popularity despite their complexity, due to the potential for reduced tailpipe emissions and fuel consumption. The range extender or Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) consists of an on board fuel convertor that converts fuel such as gasoline into electrical power while the vehicle is in operation. This enables the <b>traction</b> battery storage <b>capacity</b> to be reduced whilst still maintaining an acceptable driving range. One of the key requirements of an APU is to provide maximum electrical power. In order to do so {{it is important that}} the engine as well as the generator are operated at their maximum efficiency in addition to optimising the complete system to reduce any parasitic losses in auxiliary systems. The conflicting requirements of running the engine at a high temperature (∼ 90 °C) and the generator to run as cold as possible (∼ 50 °C) has consequences on vehicle system integration such as the need to use separate coolant loops, radiators, pumps etc. Employing a common cooling loop can reduce parasitic loads and simplify vehicle integration, but requires operating the engine and/or the generator under sub-optimum thermal conditions. The paper discusses the development of a thermal management system using a single coolant loop for the APU. The APU was tested on a bespoke rig first using two independent cooling loops to characterise the APU performance. The benefits of employing a single coolant loop are then weighed against the compromise in performance observed as a result of operating the engine and/or generator under suboptimum thermal conditions in a single loop. In the single coolant loop, there is a drop in APU power of around 4 % and an ESFC penalty of circa 2 % at full load across the operating regime. However there is a sizeable saving in parasitic losses, simplified package installation with reduction in overall package cost...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report details the end-of-life fuel efficiency and battery testing on two model year 2001 Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), two model year 2003 Honda Civic HEVs, and two model year 2002 Toyota Prius HEVs. The end-of-life testing was conducted after each vehicle has been operated for approximately 160, 000 miles. This testing {{was conducted by}} the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity (AVTA). The AVTA is part of DOE’s FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program. SAE J 1634 fuel efficiency testing {{was performed on the}} six HEVs with the air conditioning (AC) on and off. The AC on and off test results are compared to new vehicle AC on and off fuel efficiencies for each HEV model. The six HEVs were all end-of-life tested using new-vehicle coast down coefficients. In addition, one of each HEV model was also subjected to fuel efficiency testing using coast down coefficients obtained when the vehicles completed 160, 000 miles of fleet testing. <b>Traction</b> battery pack <b>capacity</b> and power tests were also performed on all six HEVs during the end-of-life testing in accordance with the FreedomCAR Battery Test Manual For Power-Assist Hybrid Electric Vehicles procedures. When using the new-vehicle coast down coefficients (Phase I testing), 11 of 12 HEV tests (each HEV was tested once with the AC on and once with the AC off) had increases in fuel efficiencies compared to the new vehicle test results. The end-of-life fuel efficiency tests using the end-of-life coast down coefficients (Phase II testing) show decreases in fuel economies in five of six tests (three with the AC on and three with it off). All six HEVs experienced decreases in battery capacities, with the two Insights having the highest remaining capacities and the two Priuses having the lowest remaining capacities.

40|$|Purpose. The {{railways}} of Ukraine {{have been}} operated the locomotives, which are both morally and physically obsolete. Therefore, {{to ensure the}} competitiveness of rail transport {{it is necessary to}} update the locomotive fleet, and first of all the fleet of electric locomotives, because electrified railways provide the greater part of passenger and freight traffic. In this connection it is of special importance to determine the optimum parameters of the nominal mode of electric rolling stock. The purpose of the work is to examine the features of solution of these problems with respect to electric locomotives. Methodology. Assuming that the limit values of traction force are determined by the conditions of wheel-rail grip, then the power of the nominal mode can be represented as the product of rated speed, estimated friction coefficient, train weight and the coefficients that represent the ratio of the estimated (starting) value of traction force to value of traction force the nominal mode and the ratio of the mass of the locomotive to the train weight. Since the mass of the train is not a constant value, there is always a surplus power of the locomotive fleet required for the mastering of a predetermined volume of transportations. Reduced overcapacity of the locomotive fleet can be achieved by introduction of the locomotives of different power, designed for driving trains of different weight that will result in increased completeness of the power use but also in difficulty in selecting of locomotives for trains in operation. The paper shows the method of calculating the optimum values of power, speed and traction force of the nominal mode. It presents the mathematical model of the relationship of <b>traction</b> rate, excessive <b>capacity</b> and power of the traction unit. Findings. It is proved that the power of the traction unit, the total fleet power requirement and the excess of power in absolute units are proportional to the speed of the nominal mode. To reduce the total power of the fleet when selecting the optimum power of the traction unit it is necessary to take into consideration the speed of the nominal mode, defined by the condition of minimization of power consumption for traction, i. e. the smallest value that enables the implementation of the given running speed and the powerredundancy level required for operation. Originality. It consists {{in the development of a}} unified algorithm for determining the optimal parameter values of the nominal mode of passenger, freight and freight-passenger electric locomotives.
