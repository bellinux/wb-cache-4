Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, {{whether or not the}} nail is truly [...] "ingrown". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing {{to the end of the}} nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>attitude</b> under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut.

I need not be told that the hen is after all only step-mother to her ducklings, since I am contending that the civilized woman--the artificial product of our self-imposed conditions--cannot have the same relation to her offspring as the uncivilized woman really has to hers. The comparison, therefore, holds good, the mother with us being practically step-mother to children of another race; and if she is sensible, and amenable to nature's teaching, she will attribute their seemingly unsuitable ways and appetites to the right cause, and not to a hypothetical perversity or inherent depravity of heart, about which many authors will have spoken to her in many books: ...|$|E

And even if we think that the moral atmosphere of Home is that of a man of dubious character, we can still feel that Browning might have achieved his purpose without making it so obvious that he thought so. Some traces again, though much fainter ones, may be found of something like a subconscious hostility to the Roman Church, or at least a less full comprehension of the grandeur of the Latin religious civilisation than might have been expected of a man of Browning's great imaginative tolerance. Æstheticism, Bohemianism, the irresponsibilities of the artist, the untidy morals of Grub Street and the Latin Quarter, he hated with a consuming hatred. He was himself exact in everything, from his scholarship to his clothes; and even when he wore the loose white garments of the lounger in Southern Europe, they were in their own way as precise as a dress suit.

'This, as you can see better than ever before,' the {{elements}} kept conspiring to say, 'is the rare, the sole, the exquisite England whose weight now hangs in the balance, and your appreciation of whose value, much as in the easy years you may have taken it for granted, seems exposed to some fresh and strange and strong determinant, something that breaks in like a character of high colour in a play.' Nothing could have thrilled me more, I recognise, than the threat of this irruption or than the dramatic pitch; yet a degree of pain attached to the ploughed-up state it implied--so that, with an elderly dread of a waste of emotion, I fear I almost pusillanimously asked myself why a sentiment from so far back recorded as lively should need to become any livelier, and in fact should hesitate to beg off from the higher diapason. I felt as the quiet dweller in a tenement so often feels when the question of 'structural improvements' is thrust upon him; my house of the spirit, amid everything about me, had become more and more the inhabited, adjusted, familiar home, quite big enough and sound enough for the spirit's uses and with any intrinsic inconvenience corrected only since by that principle's having cultivated and formed, at whatever personal cost (since my spirit was essentially a person), the right habits, and so settled into <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>attitude</b> for practical, for contented occupation. If, however, such was my vulgar apprehension, as I put it, the case was taken out of my hands by the fate that so often deals with these accidents, and I found myself before long building on additions and upper storys, throwing out extensions and protrusions, indulging even, all recklessly, in gables and pinnacles and battlements--things that had presently transformed the unpretending place into I scarce know what to call it, a fortress of the faith, a palace of the soul, an extravagant, bristling, flag-flying structure which had quite {{as much to do with}} the air as with the earth. And all this, when one came to return upon it in a considering or curious way, because to and fro one kept going on the old rampart, the town 'look-out,' to spend one's aching wonder again and again on the bright sky-line that at once held and mocked it. Just over that line were unutterable things, massacre and ravage and anguish, all but irresistible assault and cruelty, bewilderment and heroism all but overwhelmed; from the sense of which one had but to turn one's head to take in something unspeakably different and that yet produced, as by some extraordinary paradox, a pang almost as sharp.|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{show that}} {{working as a}} team in the {{operating}} theatre can be a challenge, and that surgical teams are not so cohesive as might be expected. Methods: A qualitative approach with exploratory design was used, inspired by grounded theory (GT) as a methodology. The data are from semi–structured, open questions, interviews with eight female theatre nurses from four Norwegian operational units. Results: The study shows {{that the most important}} factor in the social process between theatre nurses co-operating with other team members, is respecting. This includes interactions where: the attitudes expressed make team members feel valued; team members show an understanding for each other; team members communicate constructively. The leader’s role is to encourage <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>attitudes,</b> focusing on respect for one another. Conclusion: The study shows that cooperation is an inter-human process, which requires the presence of multiple factors in the relations between professionals. Organizational factors also play a decisive role in enhancing the quality of inter-disciplinary work. Strengthening teamwork can be a complex task in a multidisciplinary surgical team where conflicting professional identities exist.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} at exploring {{the meaning of}} democracy and academic freedom, {{and the role of}} education in cultivating <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>attitudes,</b> through some sorts of processes, aimed at making citizens effective members of their society. The application of academic freedom in a democractic Nigeria was further examined. A way forward was proffered and the paper finally looked at academic freedom as an extension of individual freedom in a democractic society, adding that it is only when a society learns to uphold the tradition of encouraging the holding of diverse and differing views on any issue that academic freedom can lay a solid foundation for both democracy and freedom in a given society. Any proposal that education should be democratic cannot seriously be contested in any country. This, however, could be interpreted in many ways.
