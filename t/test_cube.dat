40|$|Sequential linear decompressors are {{inherently}} efficient and attractive for compressing test cubes with many don’t cares. The test cubes are encoded by solving {{a system of}} linear equations. In continuous decompression, typically a fixed number of free variables are used to encode each <b>test</b> <b>cube</b> in a “one-size-fits-all ” manner. The non-pivot free variables used in Gaussian elimination are wasted when the decompressor is reset before decompressing the next <b>test</b> <b>cube.</b> This paper explores techniques for retaining the non-pivot free variables for a <b>test</b> <b>cube</b> and using them to help encode subsequent test cubes and hence improve encoding efficiency. This approach retains most of the non-pivot free variables with only a minimal increase in runtime for solving the equations and no added control information.

These patterns achieve higher coverage for transition and stuck-open faults than patterns obtained using other seed-generation methods for LFSR reseeding. Given a pattern pair (p 1,p 2) for transition faults, we also examine the transition-fault coverage for launch on capture by using p 1 and p 2 to separately compute output deviations. Results show that p 1 tends to be better when there is a high proportion of do-not-care bits in the test cubes, while p 2 is a more appropriate choice when the transition-fault coverage is high.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{system-on-chip}} (SOC) testing approach that integrates test data compression, test-access mechanism/test wrapper design, and test scheduling. An efficient linear feedback shift register (LFSR) reseeding technique {{is used as}} the compression engine. All cores on the SOC share a single on-chip LFSR. At any clock cycle, one or more cores can simultaneously receive data from the LFSR. Seeds for the LFSR are computed from the care bits for the <b>test</b> <b>cubes</b> for multiple cores. We also propose a scan-slice-based scheduling algorithm that attempts to maximize the number of care bits the LFSR can produce at each clock cycle, such that the overall test application time (TAT) is minimized. This scheduling method is static in nature because it requires predetermined <b>test</b> <b>cubes.</b> We also present a dynamic scheduling method that performs test compression during test generation. Experimental results for International Symposium on Circuits and Systems and International Workshop on Logic and Synthesis benchmark circuits, as well as industrial circuits, show that optimum TAT, which {{is determined by the}} largest core, can often be achieved by the static method. If structural information is available for the cores, the dynamic method is more flexible, particularly since the performance of the static compression method depends {{on the nature of the}} predetermined <b>test</b> <b>cubes.</b> Index Terms—ATPG, system-on-chip test, test compression, test scheduling.

The seeds are obtained by solving systems of linear equations involving the seed variables for the positions where the test cubes have specified values.

We present a general method to determine the probability of encoding {{as a function of}} the number of specified bits in the <b>test</b> <b>cube,</b> the length of the LFSR and the number of polynomials.

40|$|The DOE Office of Environmental {{management}} (DOE EM) {{faces the}} challenge of decommissioning thousands of excess nuclear facilities, {{many of which are}} highly contaminated. A number of these excess facilities are massive and robust concrete structures that are suitable for isolating the contained contamination for hundreds of years, and a permanent decommissioning end state option for these facilities is in situ decommissioning (ISD). The ISD option is feasible for a limited, but meaningfull number of DOE contaminated facilities for which there is substantial incremental environmental, safety, and cost benefits versus alternate actions to demolish and excavate the entire facility and transport the rubble to a radioactive waste landfill. A general description of an ISD project encompasses an entombed facility; in some cases limited to the blow-grade portion of a facility. However, monitoring of the ISD structures is needed to demonstrate that the building retains its structural integrity and the contaminants remain entombed within the grout stabilization matrix. The DOE EM Office of Deactivation and Decommissioning and Facility Engineering (EM- 13) Program Goal is to develop a monitoring system to demonstrate long-term performance of closed nuclear facilities using the ISD approach. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has designed and implemented the In Situ Decommissioning Sensor Network, Meso-Scale Test Bed (ISDSN-MSTB) to address the feasibility of deploying a long-term monitoring system into an ISD closed nuclear facility. The ISDSN-MSTB goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of installing and operating a remote sensor network to assess cementitious material durability, moisture-fluid flow through the cementitious material, and resulting transport potential for contaminate mobility in a decommissioned closed nuclear facility. The original ISDSN-MSTB installation and remote sensor network operation was demonstrated in FY 2011 - 12 at the ISDSN-MSTB <b>test</b> <b>cube</b> located at the Florida International University Applied Research Center, Miami, FL (FIU-ARC).

This In Situ Decommissioning Sensor Network, Meso-Scale Test Bed (ISDSN-MSTB) - Phase 3 Fluid Injection Test Summary Report summarizes the test implementation, acquired and processed data, and results from the activated embedded sensor systems used during the fluid injection test. The ISDSN-MSTB Phase 3 Fluid Injection Test was conducted from August 27 through September 6, 2013 at the FIU-ARC ISDSN-MSTB <b>test</b> <b>cube.</b> The fluid injection test activated a portion of the existing embedded sensor systems in the ISDSN-MSTB test cube: Electrical Resistivity Tomography-Thermocouple Sensor Arrays, Advance Tensiometer Sensors, and Fiber Loop Ringdown Optical Sensors.

All sensor systems were remotely operated and data acquisition was completed through the established Sensor Remote Access System (SRAS) hosted on the DOE D&D Knowledge Management Information Tool (D&D DKM-IT) server. The ISDN Phase 3 Fluid Injection Test successfully demonstrated the feasibility of embedding sensor systems to assess moisture-fluid flow and resulting transport potential for contaminate mobility through a cementitious material/grout monolith.
