25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} {{intended for}} All My Children to begin its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All My Children. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All My Children and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park {{not being able to}} sign enough cast members from All My Children.|$|E

2500|$|On May 13, 2010, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children had found a recast for the character, after a [...] "long and careful" [...] search. Actress Christina Bennett Lind, cited as having an [...] "astonishing" [...] resemblance to Riegel, was cast. [...] " [...] oozes goodness and we really needed that for Bianca. [...] brought an integrity and honest innocence to the role that was very tough to match," [...] stated Carruthers. [...] "We turned the earth [...] going through the candidates.

[...] The network stated it was replacing One Life to Live with a new production entitled The Revolution, which would focus on health and lifestyles. [...] While the cancellations of both soap operas were announced on the same day, One Life to Live was {{to remain on the}} air four months longer because its replacement would not be ready until later. In response to the cancellations, vacuum cleaner manufacturer Hoover withdrew its advertising from all ABC programs out of protest.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of France began {{less than}} two months after Reynaud came to office. France was badly mauled by the initial attack in early May 1940, and Paris was threatened. On 15 May, five days after the {{invasion}} began, Reynaud contacted Churchill and famously remarked, [...] "We have been defeated... we are beaten; we have lost the battle.... The front is broken near Sedan." [...] Indeed, such was the situation regarding equipment and morale that Reynaud received a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans. It stated: [...] "I am killing myself Mr President to let you know <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> men were brave, but one cannot send men to fight tanks with rifles." ...|$|E

A poem, {{preserved}} in his sister’s notebook, reads in part: “I stand as one who from a dungeon dream / Of open air and the free arch of stars / Waking to things that be from things that seem / Beats madly on the bars. // I am not yet quite used to be aware / <b>That</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> labor & my hope had birth / Only to freeze me with the coffined share / Of void & soulless earth.” ...|$|E

I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

2500|$|Spinoza's {{break with}} the {{prevailing}} dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, {{it appears to have}} been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: [...] "If anyone thinks my criticism [...] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warn {{said that}} the February 12, 2009 {{statements}} by Carruthers regarding Reese insulted the audience's intelligence. The statements were not supported by what the audience saw, she said. [...] "There is validity to the argument Carruthers is making — that there simply aren't enough romantic-pairing options for long-running lesbian characters unless you're willing to change the general makeup of the established cast of characters," [...] said Warn. [...] "This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians." [...] Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when it is happening on various shows, the viewer is [...] "left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children [...] "fed right into" [...] this with the Reese and Bianca storyline.|$|E

Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans know <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} it was the perfect marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether you agree or disagree with her decision, you understand her rationale. That really is important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E
2500|$|During {{interviews}} {{with one of}} her official fansites, Lopez also revealed that fans could expect a mixture of musical styles like her previous albums. [...] "Expect pop records, R and a little hip hop." [...] When Billboard previewed the album in January 2010, Ben-Yehuda Ayala said [...] "Lopez sings, talk-sings and broods (within pop reason) on the subject of love," [...] while Rap-Up said it is very much in keeping with the title, [...] "a love roller coaster, taking you through {{the ups and downs of}} a relationship." [...] Following her move to Island Def Jam, Lopez said she would still be pressing ahead with the album under the title Love?. [...] "I just feel like it's an endlessly fascinating topic <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> albums have been about. It's still very confusing to me and so I explore that on this album, probably more than my other albums." [...] She also revealed that her husband Marc Anthony initially disapproved of the title because he felt that it may imply that the couple were having marital problems. However in {{interviews with}} DJ Skee, she said [...] "love has always been a theme of my career and this record wasn't going to be different. The album has a lot of up-tempo, dancy, urban tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2013, The Online Network {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children and One Life To Live {{would no}} longer air {{five days a week}} together, due to viewer ratings that reflect online viewing patterns rather than those of traditional television.

2500|$|All My Children made {{television}} {{history on}} April 23, 2003 when Lena and Bianca shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. The kiss {{was not the}} first same-sex kiss for daytime television. The United Kingdom had featured its first lesbian kiss between fictional characters on the soap opera Brookside ten years earlier in December 1993, portrayed by actresses Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson. Lena and Bianca sharing a kiss, however, and also being between two people of the same sex, was something that had been thought of as unlikely for American soap opera. The kiss received media attention such as TV Guide, Soap Opera Digest, and other publications. On the day before the kiss aired, Riegel and Sosnovska appeared on the morning talk show The View and answered questions from Barbara Walters and the other hosts, including guest host Monica Lewinsky. Star Jones introduced the segment by stating <b>that</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children had dealt with a number of controversial topics, including [...] "AIDS, abortion, drug abuse, racial prejudice, and teenage alcoholism, but no storyline has generated the kind of buzz as the lesbian kiss". The kiss was shown to the audience and followed up with questions by the hosts consisting of whether the actresses were nervous acting out the intimate scenes and {{what it was like to}} portray lesbians.|$|E

She said in her statement that Abedin did have an email account through clintonemail.com that [...] "was used at times for government business", but that Mills did not. The statement was filed as Clinton faced questions over fifteen emails in exchanges with Blumenthal that were not among the emails she gave to the department the previous year. She did not address the matter of those emails in the statement. On September 25, 2015, several additional emails from her private server surfaced which [...] she had not provided to the State Department. These emails between Clinton and General David Petraeus, discussing personnel matters, were part of an email chain that started on a different email account before her tenure as Secretary of State, but continued onto her private server in late January 2009 after she had taken office. The existence of these emails also called into question Clinton's previous statement that she did not use the server before March 18, 2009.|$|E
