5|$|In some situations, profit-maximizing {{prices are}} not an optimal strategy. For example, where scale economies are large (as <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are),</b> {{capturing}} market share {{may be the key}} to long-term dominance of a market, so maximizing revenue or profit may not be the optimal strategy.|$|E
25|$|Coccinellids in {{temperate}} regions enter diapause {{during the}} winter, so <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> {{among the first}} insects {{to appear in the}} spring. Some species (e.g., Hippodamia convergens) gather into groups and move to higher elevations, such as a mountain, to enter diapause.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of masquerades, visible and invisible. The visible masquerades are meant for the public. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> more entertaining. Masks used offer a visual appeal for their shapes and forms. In these visible masquerades, {{performances}} of harassment, music, dance, and parodies are acted out (Oyeneke 25).|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> can <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found around {{dirt roads}} and stream beds. Most <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> found in hilly terrain or canyon lands.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, {{especially}} in the southeast, sections of hollow trees were used until the 20th century. These were called [...] "gums" [...] because <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> from black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) trees.|$|R
50|$|Radical {{cultural}} ideas came to {{the fore}} in the era of the Popular Front; <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> explicitly supported by the governments, as in the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.|$|R
25|$|Such carvings {{are said}} to ward off death and evil. Other grotesques, such as gargoyles and hunky punks, were {{frequently}} part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away (see apotropaic magic). <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.|$|E
25|$|Words {{are rarely}} not listed in {{dictionaries}} (in which case {{they would be}} lexical items) {{on the basis of}} their inflectional morphemes. However, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> listed {{on the basis of their}} derivational morphemes. For instance, English dictionaries list readable and readability, words with derivational suffixes, along with their root read. However, no traditional English dictionary lists book as one entry and books as a separate entry; the same goes for jump and jumped.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{are first}} {{seen in the}} {{original}} movie. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> covered in decorative frills, and have glowing eye-beads. They are designed for show rather than functionality. Four versions of these have been seen: Pharaoh Mask (worn by Ra), Horus Mask (Ra's Horus Jaffa and Heru-ur's Jaffa), Jackal mask (Leader of Ra's Jaffa, originally Anubis), and Serpent Mask (Apophis and his Jaffa). Seth Masks (worn by Seth and his Jaffa) have been mentioned, though never shown.|$|E
50|$|Having {{historically}} been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan {{language and culture}} differ in many ways from that of mainland Japan, where <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> discriminated against and treated {{in the same manner}} as Chinese and Koreans.|$|R
50|$|While chalk {{outlines}} were occasionally {{used in the}} past, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> {{drawn by}} the police for press photographers, not for investigative purposes. It allowed the press {{to take a picture}} and represent the scene without the gruesomeness of a body.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his early}} {{influences}} were Matisse, Mondrain, and Kandinsky, {{as well as}} Raphael and early Italian Renaissance artists such as Fra Angelico. He called his early paintings “religious” and <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> on religious themes, such as crucifixions and the stations of the cross.|$|R
25|$|Pygmies {{are often}} evicted from {{their land and}} given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not {{considered}} citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive deforestation have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> marginalized, impoverished and abused by the dominant culture.|$|E
25|$|The Timorese Hakka {{diaspora}} can currently {{be found}} in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in Australia; in Portugal; in Macau; and {{in other parts of}} the world in smaller numbers. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> highly educated, and many continue their education in either Taiwan or the People's Republic of China, while a majority of the younger generation prefer to study in Australia. The Australian government took some years to assess their claims to be genuine refugees and not illegal immigrants, as partially related to the political situation in East Timor at the time. As Asian countries were neither willing to accept them as residents nor grant them political asylum to the Timorese in general, they were forced to live as stateless persons for some time. Despite this condition, many Hakka had become successful, establishing restaurant chains, shops, supermarkets, and import operations in Australia. Since the independence of East Timor in 2000, some Hakka families had returned and invested in businesses in the newborn nation.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} years Henson's lifelong sense of {{loneliness}} was compounded by the growing deafness of his wife, making their conversation difficult. He found some solace in the friendship of her companion, Fearne Booker, who lived with the Hensons for more than thirty years. He occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography, published in three volumes under the title Retrospect of an Unimportant Life. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing the work; they thought he had done his reputation a disservice. Despite what Williams calls the [...] "peculiar interest and vivacity" [...] of the books, his survey of his many campaigns and controversies, seemed to others to be self-justifying and wilfully to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career. In Williams's view the posthumous publication of Henson's edited letters were a better legacy: [...] "delightful in both form and content, and, barbed though <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are,</b> they do him fuller justice".|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} neatly built stockades shown in {{illustrations}} of bomas, the term, in practice, more often resembled the structure {{shown in the}} cartoon accompanying this article. In that form, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> referred to {{by the likes of}} J. A. Hunter and Henry Morton Stanley.|$|R

50|$|Although other {{magazines}} called Mickey Mouse {{were available}} in many countries, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> less like the American title and more resembled WDC&S, acting as the flagship Disney title for its circulation area and thus containing stories of all the major Disney characters {{as a function of}} its anthology format.|$|R
500|$|Divided for the {{majority}} of its length, traffic volumes on Highway63 south of the Highway881 junction near Fort McMurray remain relatively light despite the high number of fatal crashes. [...] The volume is comparable to major two-lane highways in Alberta such as Highways 2A, 8, 22, 28, and 39. [...] All are in the vicinity of 10,000 vehicles per day or more in rural areas, generally double the average of Highway63. [...] While Alberta has plans to twin at least a portion of most of these highways, no project has reached the construction stage nor been expedited like Highway63. [...] Until 2013, traffic levels had steadily increased on Highway63, and an increasing number of trucks carrying large equipment caused traffic delays. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> wide enough to occupy two traffic lanes, impeding traffic in both directions. The highway is the only route leading south out of Fort McMurray until its split with Highway881, making it a critical link to Fort McMurray and the Athabasca oil sands. [...] The economic importance of the area, the number of slow moving vehicles, and the absence of alternate routes are not generally reflected in annual traffic numbers, but were factors in the decision to expedite twinning of the highway.|$|E

2500|$|Urinals in Japan {{are very}} similar to the urinals {{in the rest of the}} world, and mainly used for public male toilets or male toilets with a large number of users. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are,</b> however, mounted lower {{compared}} to urinals in the West.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of Subotica, Rákóczi joined battle against the Rac National Militia. Rác was a {{designation}} for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> referred to as rácok in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period rácok came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{characters}} {{remained as}} <b>they</b> <b>often</b> had <b>been</b> before: supportive of major character's whims and fleetingly expendable in many cases.|$|R
5000|$|In Scotland and Ireland, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> called inches, {{from the}} Gaelic innis, which {{originally}} meant island, {{but has been}} supplanted to refer to smaller islands. In Ireland <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> termed skerries.|$|R
2500|$|Many analogues of aniline {{are known}} where the phenyl group is further substituted. [...] These include toluidines, xylidines, chloroanilines, aminobenzoic acids, nitroanilines, and many others. [...] <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> {{prepared}} by nitration of the substituted aromatic compounds followed by reduction. [...] For example, {{this approach is}} used to convert toluene into toluidines and chlorobenzene into 4-chloroaniline.|$|E
2500|$|Chaps {{are also}} popular in fetish fashion and the leather subculture, where <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> tightly fitted and worn without jeans or other {{garments}} layered beneath them other than a codpiece. [...] They can be made of leather, patent leather, rubber, or vinyl and are worn for decoration serving no protective purpose. [...] Worn in this manner, they are colloquially referred to as [...] "assless" [...] chaps, despite the redundancy of the term.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the growing}} number of {{large-scale}} musicals in the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lower-budget, smaller-scale musicals managed to find critical and financial success, such as Falsettoland and Little Shop of Horrors, [...] and Blood Brothers. The topics of these pieces vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> produced off-Broadway, or for smaller London theatres, and some of these stagings have been regarded as imaginative and innovative.|$|E
50|$|A related Paris fashion {{between the}} wars was the pacquebot style, {{buildings}} that resembled the ocean liners of the period, with sleek white façades, rounded corners, white façades, and nautical railings. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> built on narrow pieces of land, or on corners. One {{example is the}} building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, built in 1935.|$|R
50|$|First {{used in the}} 1970s by Japanese radio manufacturers, for {{microphone}} connectors on Citizens Band {{and amateur}} radio equipment, these screw-on circular connectors were available with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 pins. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> used for other purposes as well, such as 1970s Kenwood mobile transceivers, Eastern Asian built soldering stations in 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Modern monarchs awarded {{titles in}} {{commemoration}} of major military victories, {{but in the}} guise of a feudal aristocratic title, often hereditary, but only in appearance: an actual fief was not required, indeed <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> granted in chief of a battlefield where the awarding monarch simply had no constitutional authority to grant anything validly under local law.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{preferred}} food is moths, though {{during daylight}} hours they will prey upon butterflies and termites. [...] In regions where the bats live, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> {{a factor in}} keeping pest populations down. This is important since the bats inhabit areas often plagued by insect-borne diseases such as malaria. They usually wait for complete darkness before foraging. Over open areas, they can detect their prey at long ranges. They periodically make dives when hunting, and with each dive, they increase the rate of echolocation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{composting}} toilet {{is a type}} of waterless toilet or micro-flush toilet system that uses a predominantly aerobic process to treat human excreta by composting or managed aerobic decomposition. These systems typically use little to no water and may be used as an alternative to flush toilets used with septic systems or sewer systems. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> used where no suitable water supply or [...] sewage treatment plant is available. Common applications include national parks, remote holiday/vacation cottages, off-grid homes, and developing countries with limited water and wastewater service.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "voiced/voiceless" [...] obstruent {{pairs of}} Ojibwe {{vary in their}} {{realization}} depending on the dialect. In many dialects, they are described as having a [...] "lenis/fortis" [...] contrast. In this analysis, all obstruents are considered voiceless. The fortis consonants are characterised by being pronounced more strongly and are longer in duration. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> aspirated or preaspirated. The lenis consonants are often voiced, especially between vowels, although they often tend to be voiceless {{at the end of}} words. They are pronounced less strongly and are shorter in duration, compared to the fortis ones. In some communities, the lenis/fortis distinction has been replaced with a pure voiced/voiceless one.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{found in}} wrecks, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> seen by scuba divers. They {{are also popular}} with spearfishermen, as they are remarkably calm in the {{presence}} of divers and are relatively easy to spear.|$|R
50|$|In India, a {{stepwell}} {{is a deep}} {{masonry well}} with steps {{going down to the}} water level in the well. It is called a vav in west India and a baoli in north India. Some were built by kings and <b>were</b> richly ornamented. <b>They</b> <b>often</b> <b>were</b> built by nobility, some being for secular use from which anyone could obtain water.|$|R
