5|$|After van der Linden's {{death in}} 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow {{a total of}} 1,000gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, {{borrowed}} from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted {{most of his time}} to <b>the</b> <b>publishing</b> house, and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. <b>The</b> <b>publishing</b> house was, however, unable to turn a profit. That year he published a new syair, consisting of 24quartets, entitled Orang Prampoewan. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including Bintang Betawi and Domingoe.|$|E

The anonymization techniques such as Generalization, Suppression, Swapping, Bucketization and Randomization suffers from either individual identity disclosure or the significant loss in information which reduces {{the usefulness of the}} data. In this paper, we present a novel Privacy Preserving Data Publishing scheme based on tuple duplication.
