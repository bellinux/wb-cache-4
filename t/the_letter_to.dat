5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads {{was part of}} a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Knox sent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Queen Regent, he {{suddenly}} {{announced that he}} felt his duty was to return to Geneva.

5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting advice is that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Æthelburg {{makes it}} clear that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter was}} {{initially}} entrusted to courier Albert Martin, who {{carried it to}} the town of Gonzales some seventy miles away. Martin added several postscripts to encourage men to reinforce the Alamo, and then handed <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Launcelot Smithers. Smithers added his own postscript and delivered <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> its intended destination, San Felipe de Austin. Local publishers printed over 700copies of the letter. It also appeared in the two main Texas newspapers and was eventually printed throughout the United States and Europe. Partially in response to the letter, men from throughout Texas and the United States began to gather in Gonzales. Between 32 and 90 of them reached the Alamo before it fell; the remainder formed the nucleus of the army which eventually defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the same}} year, during the revolt of the Danubian armies in autumn, Theodosius and his {{father-in-law}} were hunting in the outskirts of Constantinople.

They presented <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Maurice, who rejected the army's demands. The emperor however began suspecting Germanus of playing a part in the revolt. Theodosius promptly informed his father-in-law of this and advised him to hide, and on 21 November Germanus fled first to a local church and then to the Hagia Sophia, seeking sanctuary from the Byzantine emperor's emissaries.|$|E

Callaghan delivered <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command, or in leaving Singapore.

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{name for}} the town was 'Aberbrothock', {{a reference to the}} Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'.

In the earliest manuscripts available, it is seen as 'Abirbrothoke' (in <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage).
