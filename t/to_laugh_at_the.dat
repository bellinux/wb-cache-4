25|$|In Book Eight of the Odyssey, {{the blind}} singer Demodocus tells of how Aphrodite {{committed}} adultery with Ares, {{the god of}} war. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the Odyssey.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{contacted}} Pegg by e-mail, {{offering him}} the part. To achieve Scotty's accent, Pegg was assisted {{by his wife}} Maureen, who is from Glasgow, although Pegg said that Scotty was from Linlithgow and that he therefore wanted his accent to sound more East Coast Scottish. As a result, the accent he used {{is a mixture of}} both, although it leans more towards the West sound. He was also aided by James Doohan's son, Chris, and Tommy Gormley, the film's Glaswegian first assistant director. Pegg described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting [...] "Scots are the first people <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes {{from a long line of}} Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell. Years before, Pegg's character on Spaced joked that every odd-numbered Star Trek film being [...] "shit" [...] was a fact of life. Pegg noted [...] "Fate put me in the movie to show me I was talking out of my ass." ...|$|E
500|$|In Beiste's first episode, [...] "Audition", The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez {{wrote that}} the coach was [...] "the most {{interesting}} character so far", and one [...] "whose comedic range is as maniacal as Coach Sue", and Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times said Beiste was [...] "played with a perfect blend of brutishness and grace" [...] by Jones. In Beiste's fourth appearance, for the episode entitled [...] "Never Been Kissed", the character's storyline was met with criticism, though the acting of Jones was not. Reiter questioned why Beiste was made to look to {{high school students to}} [...] "gauge her own desirability", an element she found [...] "hazy and creepy". James Poniewozik of Time criticized the depiction of Beiste as an object of pity, and felt that Will's behavior was worse than the students' when he acted with [...] "amazing condescension" [...] and kissed the coach. Both Poniewozik and MTV's Aly Semigran disliked the way viewers were made complicit in Beiste's humiliation by being invited <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> character's expense, and Linda Holmes of NPR criticized Glee for denying Beiste dignity, with the observation that such a plot would never have been given to Kurt. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented negatively on the way Glee plays up Beiste's [...] "masculine nature" [...] while simultaneously lecturing viewers against mocking Beiste. He called the kiss [...] "somehow both heartfelt and completely horrifying". IGN's Robert Canning praised Jones in her [...] "best performance this season", as well as Beiste's [...] "raw and real" [...] confession to Will.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{begins as}} the turtles watch a {{television}} newscast of April O'Neil reporting from Liberty Island. Suddenly, Krang flies in using his giant exosuit and steals the Statue of Liberty. [...] Immediately thereafter Shredder hijacks the airwaves <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> turtles. [...] They head to downtown New York and pursue the Foot Clan {{through the streets}} and the city sewers, where Shredder sends them through a time warp. The turtles then have to fight Shredder's army through multiple eras of time to defeat him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the usual praise for the couple's campaigns, the Gay and Lesbian Times criticized fans of the couple on September 4, 2008 for their campaign efforts. They called it unbelievable that people counted the number of episodes Luke and Noah appeared in and shared together {{and that it would}} be [...] "easy <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trivial nature of the fans concerns" [...] if not for [...] "the state of all nonfiction (read: real) gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people nationwide and internationally". Gay and Lesbian Times stated that there are more important things in life than the romance of two soap opera characters.|$|E
2500|$|As {{she grew}} older, she {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} other male impersonators, performing songs where she portrayed young men behaving either embarrassingly or badly. Among these characters were the titular 'Burlington Bertie' and a clerk on holiday at the seaside ('The Seaside Sultan'). [...] These were intended to be comical and allowed the audience <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inflated egos of these characters. Equally comical was the play on her identity as a woman and the subject matter of many of her songs. 'Girls are the Ruin of Men', 'Following in Father's Footsteps', 'The girls I've left behind me' and 'Naughty Boy' are a few examples.|$|E

2500|$|Mellor, pp. xlviiixlix, 194199. Tacitus couldn't {{be worried}} less (Ann. IV,35): [...] "quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet qui praesenti potentia credunt extingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memoriam. nam contra punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas, neque aliud externi reges aut qui eadem saevitia usi sunt nisi dedecus sibi atque illis gloriam peperere." [...] - [...] "And so one {{is all the}} more {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stupidity of men who suppose that the despotism of the present can actually efface the remembrances of the next generation. On the contrary, the persecution of genius fosters its influence; foreign tyrants, and all who have imitated their oppression, have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their victims." ...|$|E
2500|$|Younghusband {{finally arrived}} at Gulmit to a 13-gun salute. In khaki, the envoy greeted Safdar Ali at the marquee on the Karakoram Highway, {{the men of}} Hunza {{kneeling}} at their ruler's feet. This was colonial diplomacy, based on protocol and etiquette, but Younghusband had not come for merely trivial discussions. Reinforced by Durand's troops, Younghusband's arguments were to prevent the criminal looting, murder and highway robbery. Impervious to reason though he was, Younghusband {{was not prepared to}} allow Safdar Ali <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Raj. A demonstration of firepower [...] "caused quite a sensation" [...] he wrote in his diaries. The British major was disdainful, but content when he left on November 23, to return to India, which he reached by Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|Dickens {{is often}} {{described}} as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. [...] "You would need to have a heart of stone", he declared in one of his famous witticisms, [...] "not <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> death of little Nell." [...] G. K. Chesterton, stated: [...] "It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his [...] "despotic" [...] use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.|$|E

2500|$|In his Jewish Daily Forward essay, [...] "Breaking the Mold of the Sitcom," [...] Heinze {{analyzes}} {{his favorite}} TV comedy, Seinfeld, casting an affectionate {{eye on the}} show's creators, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, and marveling at their success in probing [...] "the many gestures, innuendoes and gaps in the messages we send each other every day in every type of situation. Those, they know, contain the real meanings that pass back and forth {{beneath the surface of}} our conventions. Those are the explosives littering the minefield that is life in society." [...] Heinze is stunned that the show is able to pack so much original comedy into twenty-two minutes of airtime, and he has little sympathy for people who dismiss the show as being shallow or neurotically self-focused: [...] "People with little sense of humor have failed, time and again, to understand that the notorious self-centeredness of the show’s characters enables us <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> selfish, neurotic traits we all share but prefer to disguise." ...|$|E
