In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by the media to be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted to entertain the spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle would be better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was convinced {{he would be able to}} improve his performance.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{consists}} of five administrative divisions, {{which are in}} turn divided into 25 districts. For each district, the state government appoints a village headman (known as ketua kampung) for each village. The administrative divisions are inherited from the British administration, which are before administered as province. During the British rule, a Resident was appointed to govern each division and provided with a palace (Istana). The post of the Resident was abolished and replaced with district officers {{for each of the}} district when North Borneo became part of Malaysia. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government. However, ever since the suspension of local government elections {{in the midst of the}} Malayan Emergency, which was much less intense in Sabah <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the rest of the country, there have been no local elections.

5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being {{absorbed into the}} Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention {{to the risk of}} extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E

My results suggest that all three models (the life cycle, altruism, and dynasty models) coexist in both countries, that the selfish life cycle model is the most applicable model in both countries but that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> far more applicable <b>in</b> Japan <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the U.
