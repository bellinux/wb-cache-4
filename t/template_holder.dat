40|$|UV nanoimprint {{lithography}} (UV NIL) is attracting {{more and more}} interest, because of its potential to become a high-resolution, low-cost patterning technique. To establish UV NIL as a low-cost patterning technique, the costs of single templates, today obtained from 6025 quartz mask blanks, have to be reduced and the life-time of the antisticking layers has to be optimized. Within this work, a process flow was de-veloped to obtain 49 UV nanoimprint templates with a dimension of 12. 5 × 12. 5 mm² out of a fused silica substrate with a diameter of 150 mm. After sawing, etching, and cleaning, the template surfaces were covered with an antisticking layer. Next, the templates were glued onto a <b>template</b> <b>holder</b> to enable their handling with the nanoimprint tool NPS 300 from Süss MicroTec. With this process flow, the prize of one single template was strongly reduced compared to quartz templates obtained from 6025 quartz mask blanks. In addition, the life-time of antisticking layers was investigated. For this purpose, the change of the surface tension of antisticking layers after {{an increasing number of}} imprints into different UV curing materials was measured and the best combination of antisticking layer and UV curing material was figured out. Finally, silicon substrates were patterned with the optimized template...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the primary}} {{objective}} of the keyboard to input data into the computer, the advanced keyboards keep various other things in mind, such as, {{how to use the}} same keyboard for various other purposes, or how to use the same keyboard efficiently by using various other attachments to the keyboard. This objective led to various inventions on keyboard attachments, some of which are illustrated below in this article. This article illustrates 10 inventions on various keyboard attachments from US patent database. Each different attachment improves the usability of the keyboard in some way or other. Some attachments illustrated are <b>template</b> <b>holders,</b> paper holders, pointing device attachments, mouse pad attachments, wrist rest attachments, storage device attachments, and multimedia attachments.

40|$|We study an Anosov flow OEt in S 3 Γ ffigure- 8 knotg. Birman and Williams conjectured in [2] {{that the}} knot types of the {{periodic}} orbits of this flow could have at most two prime factors. Below, we give a geometric method for constructing knots in this flow with {{any number of}} prime factors. AMS (MOS) Subj. Class. : Primary 57 M 25; Secondary 58 F 13 flows knot complements periodic orbits templates The periodic orbits of a smooth flow on S 3 with positive topological entropy form infinitely many knots [3]. These knots {{and how they are}} linked have been studied with the aid of <b>templates</b> or knots <b>holders,</b> which are compact, 2 -dimensional branched manifolds with smooth semi-flows [2]. The complement of the figure- 8 knot in S 3 can be fibered with fiber a punched torus which has the figure- 8 knot as its boundary. Let ss: S 3 Γ ffigure- 8 knotg! S 1 be a projection map for the fibration. By integrating along the gradient of ss we obtain a flow. Any such flow induces a diffeomorphism on the fibers, which is called the monodromy of the flow. The monodromy of this flow was shown by Thurston [6] to be isotopic to the map A = &quot; 2 11 1 #; where we view the punched torus as the unit square in (R 2 Γ Z 2) =Z 2. This map is Anosov. By the work of Asimov and Franks [1] we know that any flow 1 with monodromy in the same isotopy class as an Anosov map, will have at least the knots given by the suspension of the Anosov map. Birman and Williams [2] showed that the knots in the suspension of A, and how they are linked, are mimicked by the periodic orbits of the template, T 1, shown in figure 1. Be to more precise, for any finite link in this template there is an ambient isotopy to a link in the suspension flow (with one or two exceptions that won't concern us). They conjectured that these knots could have at most two prime factors and that for any template there would be a bound on the number of prime factors of the periodic orbits in the semi-flow. However, we can now show the opposite. Theorem. For any positive integer N, there is a knot with N prime factors in the suspension flow At of A in the figure 8 knot complement...|$|R
