5|$|In the game, Eddie Lacy {{rushed for}} 106 yards on 15 carries {{for his first}} 100-yard rushing game of the season.

5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine is {{also known}} as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The mine is a part of a salt range that {{originated}} about 800 million years ago, when evaporation of a shallow sea followed by geological movement formed a salt range <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> for about 300 kilometers (185 miles).|$|E

5|$|Windsor Castle {{continued}} to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted {{a visit from the}} Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> the accommodation of the castle to its limits.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861 the {{critical}} border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the American Civil War. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky. The riverside town was situated on 180 foot high bluffs that commanded {{the river at}} that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines and a heavy chain <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce {{to the south and}} beyond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg Celtic went a goal down through an own goal from Joos Valgaeren on 48 minutes. Larsson {{equalised}} seconds later, but then missed a penalty kick on 75 minutes. Despite {{a couple of good}} chances {{near the end of the}} game, Celtic were unable to score a winning goal. The 1–1 draw, watched by around 60,000 fans, was Martin O'Neill's 50th unbeaten match at Celtic Park, a record of results <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> back to their last home defeat which was against Ajax in August 2001.|$|E

5|$|Route32 {{was once}} {{made up of}} several privately owned turnpikes <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> {{throughout}} New York. A stretch from Catskill to Cairo was also once part of the Susquehannah Turnpike. Created in April 1800, the Susquehannah Turnpike began in Catskill and ended in Unadilla. The Susquehannah Turnpike aided the growth of Greene County, which until then had depended on steamboats on the Susquehanna River and Catskill Creek. The turnpike attracted business from the New England states, made shipping easier for the county's farmers, and improved shipping from New York City.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable to}} take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.|$|E

5|$|These moves {{initiated}} the Siege of Tobruk. Although isolated by land, the garrison was {{supplied by the}} Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port. This failure was significant; Erwin Rommel's front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt.

5|$|Tigranes' {{expansion}} into the Near East {{led to the}} creation of an Armenian empire <b>that</b> <b>stretched</b> almost across the entire region. With his father-in-law and ally securing the empire's western flank, Tigranes was able to conquer territories in Parthia and Mesopotamia and annex the lands of the Levant. In Syria, he began the construction of the city of Tigranocerta (also written Tigranakert), which he named after himself, and imported a multitude of peoples, including Arabs, Greeks, and Jews, to populate it. The city soon became the king's headquarters in Syria and flourished as a great center for Hellenistic culture, complete with theaters, parks and hunting grounds.|$|E

He then scored in Chelsea's 2012 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final 3–1 win against Monterrey of the Mexican Liga MX on 13 December 2012, before playing in the 1–0 defeat to Brazilian Série A side Corinthians in the final three days later.|$|E
