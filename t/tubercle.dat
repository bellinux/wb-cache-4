5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital <b>tubercle.</b> Initially undifferentiated, the <b>tubercle</b> develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different {{versions of the same}} structure).|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital <b>tubercle</b> elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the {{urogenital}} folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital <b>tubercle</b> allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital <b>tubercle.</b> Initially undifferentiated, the <b>tubercle</b> develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ho, Chakrabarty and Sparks: {{the fish}} [...] "is {{characterized}} by having relatively strong <b>tubercles</b> on the dorsal surface, {{a row of}} <b>tubercles</b> almost always present dorsal to the orbit, both sphenotic <b>tubercles</b> well developed and sharp, trifid principal <b>tubercles</b> on the disk margin with anterior spinelet enlarged, dense arrangement of <b>tubercles</b> on the tail and a comparatively large adult body size." ...|$|R

30|$|Addition of <b>tubercles</b> to {{the blades}} {{was done with}} the intent of {{decreasing}} the drag {{and at the same time}} increasing the lift-to-drag ratio without sacrificing structure stability of the blades. When comparing the normal blades with and without <b>tubercles,</b> it was shown that the blades with <b>tubercles</b> had lower maximum stresses and displacements. This proved the <b>tubercles</b> did not lose any structural strength. The same was true for the extended normal blades with <b>tubercles</b> and without. Comparing the maple blades, there was a slight increase in maximum stress for the maple seed blades with <b>tubercles.</b> However, a majority of the maple blades with <b>tubercles</b> showed a decrease in displacement. These were also small changes. If CFD simulations were to show an increase in lift and decrease in drag, the changes would be enough to consider the <b>tubercles</b> successful.|$|R
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A <b>tubercle,</b> known as Darwin's <b>tubercle,</b> is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|Ground-dwelling frogs {{generally}} {{lack the}} adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch's spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised <b>tubercle</b> {{often referred to}} as a spade, that helps them to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Mammillaria species tend to grow low to {{the ground}} in solitary or grouped in clusters. The genus is marked by its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on the apex of the <b>tubercle,</b> and {{flowering}} areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is woolly and covered with bristles.|$|E
50|$|Cidarid {{sea urchins}} are {{characterized}} by their stout skeletton : the test is thick and hard, with massive perforated <b>tubercles</b> (never crenulated) surrounded by a crown of secondary <b>tubercles,</b> but no primary <b>tubercles</b> in the interambulacra regions. These <b>tubercles</b> hold massive spines, thick, strong and often very long, and showing sometimes odd shapes (thorny spines, fans, clubs, christmas trees...).|$|R
50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is pale {{brown with}} black {{spots on the}} ceratal <b>tubercles.</b> There are rows of <b>tubercles</b> tipped with black spots running across the body between the cerata; {{typically}} four <b>tubercles</b> in a row.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the human}} body there are {{numerous}} sites where <b>tubercles</b> develop. On bones, they are usually eminences used for muscle connections. Larger <b>tubercles</b> are also known as tuberosities. Within the lungs and on the genitals, <b>tubercles</b> are pathological.|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial <b>tubercle</b> and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral <b>tubercle</b> of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} arch may insert {{into the}} tendon of the pectoralis major muscle, the fascia of the coracobrachialis muscle, or the fascia covering the biceps brachii muscle. Insertion into the pectoralis major muscle proper, the long {{head of the}} biceps brachii muscle, the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor muscle, the axillary fascia and to the bone at {{the crest of the}} greater <b>tubercle</b> of the humerus inserting distal to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle have all been reported.|$|E
50|$|Subgenus Turrilites has weak {{ribs and}} strong <b>tubercles.</b> Subgenus Euturrilites has strong ribs, {{commonly}} depressed in middle, especially on early whorls, and no <b>tubercles.</b> Subgenus Mesoturrilites has almost no ribs and clavate <b>tubercles</b> {{that tend to}} form spiral ridges.|$|R
50|$|This nudibranch has a black dorsum {{with tall}} white-capped <b>tubercles</b> with pink or grey bases. These <b>tubercles</b> are {{in groups of}} 2-4 on {{the middle of the}} back, with smaller, single <b>tubercles</b> towards the edge of the mantle. The rhinophores are black.|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's <b>tubercle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small <b>tubercle</b> (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct <b>tubercle</b> is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} humeral ligament, which {{passes from}} the lesser <b>tubercle</b> {{to the greater}} <b>tubercle</b> of humerus, covers the intertubercular groove, in which the long head of biceps brachii travels.|$|E
50|$|Hemilepistus schirasi is {{a species}} of {{woodlouse}} that lives {{in and around the}} deserts of central and southern Iran. It can be distinguished from other species of Hemilepistus in Iran by the pattern of <b>tubercles</b> on the head. H. schirasi has six large <b>tubercles</b> in a semicircle, and rows of three <b>tubercles</b> extending to the outside corners of the head; other species have more <b>tubercles,</b> in different arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|D. bennetti {{was first}} {{described}} in 1919 (Hussakof and Bryant). Specimens of Deinodus exhibit {{a variety of}} shapes, though most possess the characteristic large <b>tubercles</b> reported by Hussakof and Bryant (1918). Those specimens that do not possess <b>tubercles</b> resemble those that do possess <b>tubercles.</b> These <b>tubercles</b> are usually found on a margin, close to the widest point, and are different in appearance from those reported in other placoderms (Long, 1997).|$|R
50|$|In {{relation}} to the animal's body size, the skin appears very thin and delicate. As typical for non-feathered dinosaurs, the skin consisted of non-overlapping scales called <b>tubercles.</b> Two sorts of <b>tubercles</b> can be found: The small (1 to 3 mm in diameter) rounded ground <b>tubercles,</b> which are evenly distributed, form the ground plan. The larger (less than 5 mm in diameter) pavement <b>tubercles</b> are pentagonal in shape, raised relative to the ground <b>tubercles,</b> and arranged in irregular clusters interrupting the ground plan. The clusters consist of between twenty and several hundreds of individual pavement <b>tubercles,</b> and are bordered by intermediate <b>tubercles</b> which mediate in size and shape between ground and pavement <b>tubercles.</b> In the chest- and abdominal region, clusters are small, oval in shape and arranged in irregular longitudinal lines. They become larger towards {{the sides of the}} trunk, where they reach 5 to 10 mm in diameter; their shape becomes more irregular. The largest clusters can be found above the pelvis and measure 50 cm in diameter; presumably, clusters of similar size were present along the animal's back.|$|R
25|$|Mesoderm {{extends to}} the midventral line for some {{distance}} behind the umbilical cord, and forms {{the lower part of}} the abdominal wall; it ends below in a prominent swelling, the cloacal <b>tubercle,</b> which after the separation of the rectum becomes the genital <b>tubercle.</b> Dorsally to this <b>tubercle</b> the sides aren't really fused. Rather, the urogenital part of the cloacal membrane separates the ingrowing sheets of mesoderm.|$|E

50|$|This nudibranch has a black dorsum {{with large}} yellow-capped <b>tubercles</b> {{surrounded}} by pale blue or translucent white rings. Towards {{the edge of}} the mantle these <b>tubercles</b> become small and scattered, sometimes without any yellow caps. The rhinophores are yellow or orange. A distinctive feature is the presence of small, yellow-capped, <b>tubercles</b> at the edges of some of the large <b>tubercles</b> {{in the middle of the}} back, and scattered smaller <b>tubercles</b> between the larger ones. The underside of the foot is grey with a longitudinal black line. It is very similar to Phyllidia carlsonhoffi and Phyllidia madangensis.|$|R

5000|$|The {{shell is}} {{compressed}} in early growth stages, with rounded or high and clavate siphonal <b>tubercles</b> tending {{to form a}} serrate keel, straight or slightly sinuous ribs and weak umbilical and strong ventrolateral <b>tubercles.</b> later whorls tend to be squarer in section with exaggerated ventrolateral <b>tubercles.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{arms were}} short and stout with very large hands. There were no skin folds on the wrists, though a {{scalloped}} fringe of skin was present from the elbows to {{just below the}} discs on the fourth fingers. The fingers were all relatively short with large flattened discs on the tips. The discs on the second, third, and fourth fingers were about the same diameter as the tympana. Small protrusions known as <b>tubercles</b> were present {{on the underside of}} the hands. On the first finger, the <b>tubercles</b> on the tipmost joints were elliptical in shape. On the second and third fingers, the <b>tubercles</b> below the finger joints (subarticular <b>tubercles)</b> were smaller than that on the fourth fingers. Therewere no <b>tubercles</b> on the palms of the hands though elongated flat <b>tubercles</b> were present behind the bases of the inner fingers (the [...] "thumbs"). Numerous small and round <b>tubercles</b> were also present in between the joints of the fingers. The fingers were more or less fully webbed.|$|R
