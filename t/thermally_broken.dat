These normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient, low-emissivity coatings, sealed argon or krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, and 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> window frames.|$|E
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} self-healing {{ability of}} polyketone (PK) chemically modified into furan and/or OH groups containing derivatives is presented. Polymers bearing different ratios of both functional groups were cross-linked via furan/bis-maleimide (Diels-Alder adducts) and hydrogen bonding interactions (aliphatic and aromatic OH groups). The resulting thermosets display tuneable softening points (peak of tan (delta)) from 90 to 137 degrees C as established by DMTA. It is {{found that the}} cross-linked system containing only furan groups shows the highest softening temperature. On the other hand, systems displaying the combination of Diels-Alder adducts and hydrogen bonding (up to 60 mol % of -OH groups) do not show any change in modulus between heating cycles (i. e. factually a quantitative recovery of the mechanical behaviour). It is believed that the novelty of these tuneable thermosets can offer significant advantages over conventional reversible covalent systems. The synergistic reinforcement of both interactions resists multiple heating/healing cycles without any loss of mechanical properties even for <b>thermally</b> healed <b>broken</b> samples.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of nitrogen plasma exposure of the InP surface on the electrical characteristics of electron cyclotron resonance deposited Al/SiNx:H/InP devices. Nitrogen plasma exposure was performed just before the SiNx:H deposition without vacuum breaking. A 30 s plasma treatment at low microwave power (60 W) sharply reduces the minimum of the interface trap density, from 4 x 10 (12) to 1. 6 x 10 (12) eV(- 1) cm(- 2) (obtained by the high-low frequency capacitance method). We explain this reduction due {{to the formation of}} P-N and/or In-P-N complexes at the InP surface during the plasma-exposure step. These bonds are <b>broken</b> <b>thermally</b> after a rapid thermal annealing of the device. The minimum of the interface trap density, obtained at the optimum plasma exposure conditions, is among the lowest ones reported in the Literature and similar to those obtained with more complicated processing technologies of the SiNx:H/InP structure. This is a clear indication that plasma exposure in N- 2 atmosphere seems to be a valuable and simple surface conditioning method...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>thermally</b> altered and <b>broken</b> flint artifacts is common at archaeological sites. Most studies focus {{their attention on}} the effects of heat treatment on flint to improve knapping qualities, disregarding the effects of fire over flint under uncontrolled conditions. This paper aims to show how under uncontrolled heating processes flint artifacts develop different heat alterations (such as levels of breakage, {{presence of}} scales, etc.) as a result of vertical distribution, volume or raw material and to establish a gradient of rock changes and behavior. Artifacts where macroscopically analyzed and a series of uncontrolled heating experiments through the distribution of flint blanks under two hearths were carried out, allowing a comparison of the before and after of the blanks. Preliminary results show how levels of breakage, surface alteration or development of heat alteration features can be differentiated according to artifact volume, vertical distribution and level of surface alteration. Results also show how two different raw materials react differently to similar thermal impact, and how surface alteration reacts at different rhythm in the case of recycled artifacts. We conclude that levels of thermal alteration can be differentiated through macroscopic analysis of flint surface...|$|R

The agency hired the firm of Quinn Evans Architects to design the renovations and improvements. Interior changes include improving handicapped accessibility, main entrance visibility, and perimeter security. The entire façade will be replaced (using Tennessee marble again). The glass curtain walls will be replaced with triple glazed, <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> panels set in an aluminum frame. The curtain walls will be reinforced with steel to help improve their resistance to explosive blasts. Additional changes the Smithsonian would like to make, but which {{are not included in}} the $365 million price tag, include the installation of 1,300 solar panels on roof and the Independence Avenue side of the museum, the construction of vestibules over the main entrances, and reconstruction of the terraces (which leak water into the parking garage and offices beneath the structure). The Smithsonian said it would submit its designs to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) on July 9, 2015, for review and approval. If the NCPC authorizes the changes, the museum (which has the money for construction in hand) could begin work in 2018 and finish in 2024.|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{failures}} in thermally toughened glass are frequently reported, although the actual percentage is quite small, suppliers in the Netherlands reporting {{one or two}} cases a year while thousands of tempered panels are supplied. These cases are rarely investigated in the Netherlands because the <b>broken</b> <b>thermally</b> toughened glass is usually not in one piece and can thus not be sent for analysis. In 2015 several sliding thermally toughened glass single curved vehicle roof windows failed within several months. A butterfly pattern was seen and NiS failure was suspected by the window manufacturer. As a coloured adhesive foil had been applied during manufacturing the glass shards were kept together. The broken glass was shipped back to the supplier and was together with several non-broken roof windows sent to Delft University of Technology for analysis. The compressive surface pre-stress in the intact roof panels was measured with a SCALP 5 device. It {{was found that the}} compressive surface pre-stress varied, as bands of low compressive surface pre-stress alternating with bands of high compressive surface pre-stress appeared in the specimens. Destructive testing of the intact windows showed that the windows failed in the bands of low compressive surface pre-stress. The actual bending strength was far below the strength thermally toughened glass should have. Microscopic analysis of the butterfly fragment of the “spontaneously” failed roof windows showed that the failure was not caused by any inclusion in the glass, but started at the surface of the glass and was probably due to overloading. It is concluded that the failures were not spontaneous but the result of overloading due to uneven tempering of the glass. Structural MechanicsStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCantilevered {{concrete}} balcony slab in high-rise {{residential buildings}} {{that create a}} thermal bridge is under scrutiny due to an increasing demand for energy efficient and thermally comfortable occupied spaces. In North America balcony slabs with thermal breaks are uncommon among the current residential stock.

The alternate design consisted of using an insulated concrete curb at the sliding balcony door. The thermal performance of this design was carried out using THERM. Comparison of the simulation results of the alternate design were done with simulation results using non-thermally broken conventional slab, and <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> slab with proprietary details. The results showed that measurable increase in surface temperatures are possible with the insulated curb design.

40|$|The optical {{conductivity}} of Ba(Fe_ 0. 92 Co_ 0. 08) _ 2 As_ 2 shows a clear {{signature of}} the superconducting gap, but a simple s-wave description fails in accounting for the low frequency response.

This extra peak and the coexisting s-wave response respect the total sum rule indicating a common origin for the carriers.

40|$|This {{research}} article discusses methods for designing high-performance facades {{with a focus}} on minimizing heat transfer and improving energy usage. The facade {{is one of the most}} significant contributors to the energy budget and comfort parameters of any building. Control of physical environmental factors, including methods for minimizing heat transfer, must be considered during the design process. High-performance facades need to block adverse external environmental effects and maintain internal comfort conditions with minimal energy consumption. The research was conducted by initially modelling conductive heat transfer in four different exterior wall types, including a brick cavity wall, a rain-screen facade with terracotta cladding, a rain-screen facade with glass fiber–reinforced concrete cladding, and a curtain wall, to compare their relative thermal performances. Then, heat-transfer modelling was conducted for three thermally improved systems, including curtain walls with <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> framing, rain-screen facades with thermal spacers, and rain-screen facades with thermal isolators. Effects on energy use were also investigated; energy usage was modeled for an office space enclosed with the analyzed facade types for all U. S. climate zones.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the thermal performance of window systems using full-scale measurements and simulation tools. A chamber was installed on the balcony of an apartment to control the temperatures which can create condensation on the interior surfaces of window systems. The condensation process on the window was carefully scrutinized when outdoor and indoor temperature and indoor relative humidity ranged from − 15 °C to − 20 °C, 23 °C to 24 °C, and 50 % to 65 %, respectively. The results of these investigations were analyzed to determine how the moisture is influenced by changing temperatures. It appears that the glass-edge was highly susceptible to the temperature variations and the lowest temperature on the glass edge was caused by the heat transfer through the spacer, between the two glass panels of the window. The results from the simulation used in this study confirm that the thermal performance of window systems can be improved the use of super insulated or <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> spacers. If the values of the indoor humidity and temperature are given, then the outdoor temperature when condensation forms can be obtained by using Temperature Difference Ratio (TDR). This methodology can be employed to predict the possible occurrence of condensation...|$|E

Control of physical environmental factors must be considered during the design process. High-performance facades need to block adverse external environmental effects and maintain internal comfort conditions with minimum energy consumption. This research was conducted by modelling conductive heat transfer in five different exterior wall types (brick cavity wall, rainscreen facade with terracotta cladding, rainscreen facade with glass-fiber reinforced concrete cladding, curtain wall, and a curtain wall with <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> framing), where U-values were compared to determine thermal performance.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of waste automobile tyres causes a severe environmental problem, and also contaminates {{the soil and}} reduces the fertility. The anthropogenic gases raise from the disposal area {{is one of the}} reasons for the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs). The burning of automobile tyres is toxic and harmful to the human being. Therefore, it is very much essential to dispose the waste tyres in an efficient way. Pyrolysis process is one of the methods to recycle the waste automobile tyres in to useful energy. In the pyrolysis process, long chain polymers are <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> down into smaller hydrocarbon in the oxygen free environment. The process yields three principal products, viz., tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO), pyro gas and carbon black. The TPO consists of C, H, O, N and S containing organic compounds and water. The organic compounds range from C 5 to C 20. The TPO contains fractions of volatility consistent with gasoline, kerosene and diesel. As a result, the TPO was examined as an alternative fuel in both spark ignition (SI) engines and compression ignition (CI) engines. The solid carbon black can be used in industrial application such as re-treading, coating of insulation and industrial filters. The main drawback of TPO is its lower cetane number due to which it can not be used as sole fuel in diesel engine. The cetane number of TPO is in the range of 25 - 30. This issue can be resolved by blending TPO with a fuel of higher cetane number. In this regard, the TPO was blended with Jatropha methyl ester (JME), whose cetane number is higher than that of diesel, and used as an alternative fuel in a single cylinder, four stroke, air cooled, direct injection (DI) diesel engine developing 4. 4 kW. In this research study, seven modules of work were carried out that include six experimental and one optimization. Experiments have been conducted by using five different blends where TPO was blended, from 10 to 50...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in window frames with internal air cavities is studied in this thesis. Investigations focus on two- and three-dimensional natural convection effects inside air cavities, {{the dependence of}} the emissivity on the thermal transmittance, and the emissivity of anodized and untreated aluminum profiles. The investigations are mostly conducted on window frames which are {{the same size as}} real frames found in residential buildings. Numerical and experimental investigations were performed to study the effectiveness of one commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program for simulating combined natural convection and heat {{transfer in}} simple three-dimensional window frames with internal air cavities. The accuracy of the conjugate CFD simulations was evaluated by comparing results for surface temperature on the warm side of the specimens to results from experiments that use infrared (IR) thermography to map surface temperatures during steady-state thermal tests. In general, there was good agreement between the simulations and experiments. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics and conduction simulations are performed to study the difference between treating air cavities as a fluid and as a solid when calculating the thermal transmittance of window frames. The simulations show that traditional software codes, simulating only conduction and using equivalent conductivities for the air cavities, give U- values that compare well with results from fluid flow simulations. The difference between the two models are mostly limited to the temperature distribution inside air cavities. It is also found that cavities with an interconnection less than about 7 mm can be treated as separate cavities. Three-dimensional natural convection effects in simple and custom-made PVC and <b>thermally</b> <b>broken</b> aluminum window frames with one open internal cavity were studied, with the use of CFD simulations and thermography experiments. Focus was put on corner effects and heat transfer rates. From the results it appears that the thermal transmittance of a four-sided section can be found by calculating the average of the thermal transmittance of the respective single horizontal and vertical sections. In addition, it was found that two-dimensinal conduction heat transfer simulation software agrees well with tree-dimensional CFD simulations if the natural convection correlations used for the internal cavities are correct. Numerical studies were done with natural convection in three-dimensional cavities with a high vertical aspect ratio and a low horizontal aspect ratio. The cavities studied had vertical aspect ratios of 20, 40, and 80 and horizontal aspect ratios ranging from 0, 2 to 5. It was shown that three-dimensional cavities with a horizontal aspect ratio larger than five can be considered to be a two-dimensional cavity to within 4 % when considering heat transfer rates. Nusselt number correlations for the different horizontal aspect ratios are presented for cavities with vertical aspect ratios of 20 and 40. Complex multicellular flow was studied for the case where the vertical and horizontal aspect ratios were 40 and 2, respectively. Experimental studies included the normal spectral and total emissivity of specimens from six meter long untreated and anodized aluminum profiles. Specimens facing the internal cavities (thermal break cavity and all aluminum cavity) were measured. Some masking tapes often used in hot box experiments were also measured. The normal total emissivity was found to be is fairly constant (between 0. 834 and 0. 856) for exterior parts of the anodized profile and for surfaces facing the thermal break cavity. The normal total emissivity of the all-aluminum internal cavities was found to vary between 0. 055 and 0. 82. The experiments were performed with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the wavelength interval from 4. 5 to 40 μm. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
