40|$|AbstractConformance {{testing is}} very {{important}} in the framework of protocol engineering. In order to test if the implementation of a protocol conforms to its specification, a test sequence must be generated from the specification, which will be used by an external tester. An external tester includes an active tester and a <b>test</b> <b>responder.</b> When the active tester is far away from the <b>test</b> <b>responder,</b> the <b>test</b> sequence may suffer a synchronization problem. This paper focuses on the complexity of generating synchronizable test sequences. It is shown that generating a minimum-cost synchronizable test sequence is an NP-hard problem. Besides, it is also shown that designing an s-approximation algorithm for the problem is at least as hard as designing an e-approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem obeying the triangle inequality. Few results on complexity issues of conformance testing appeared before...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that asymptomatic diabetic patients undergo routine screening for subclinical atherosclerotic disease using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. We herein analyze the expected cost and benefit associated with such a conditional test-treatment strategy (scintigraphic testing followed by statin treatment in positive <b>test</b> <b>responders)</b> in comparison to an unconditional treatment strategy (no testing and statin treatment in all). This analysis shows that unconditional treatment is the dominant strategy, costing 24 % less ($ 3. 2 billion) and preventing 25 % more (16, 800) atherosclerotic events annually on a national basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is sometimes complicated by concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The {{purpose of the}} present study is to identify an iNPH-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker dynamics and to assess its ability to differentiate iNPH from AD. Total tau (t-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), amyloid-β (Aβ) 42 and 40, and leucine-rich α- 2 -glycoprotein (LRG) were measured in 93 consecutive CSF samples consisting of 55 iNPH (46 tap <b>test</b> <b>responders),</b> 20 AD, 11 corticobasal syndrome, and 7 spinocerebeller disease. Levels of t-tau and p-tau were significantly decreased in iNPH patients especially in tap <b>test</b> <b>responders</b> compared to AD. Correlation was observed between Mini-Mental State Examination scores and Aβ 42 in AD (R = 0. 44) and mildly in iNPH (R = 0. 28). Although Aβ 42 / 40 ratio showed no significant difference between iNPH and AD (p = 0. 08), the levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 correlated positively with each other in iNPH (R = 0. 73) but much less in AD (R = 0. 26), suggesting that they have discrete amyloid clearance and pathology. LRG levels did not differ between the two. Thus, our study shows that although CSF biomarkers of iNPH patients can be affected by concomitant tau and/or amyloid pathology, CSF t-tau and p-tau are highly useful for differentiation of iNPH and AD...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{present an}} {{objective}} method to evaluate gait improvements after tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Tap test {{is often used}} to prognosticate shunt responsiveness, although test accuracy is limited by the lack of quantitative outcome measures. Design: Retrospective analysis of gait data. Setting: Public tertiary care center, day hospital. Gait analysis was performed before and 2 - 4 hours after tap test. Participants: 60 iNPH patients and 50 age and sex matched controls (used to obtain reference intervals). From an initial referred sample of 79 patients, we excluded those unable to walk without walking aids (n = 9) or with incomplete (pre/post tap test) gait data (n= 10). Thirteen out of 60 patients were shunted and then reappraised after 6 months. Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Mahalanobis distance from controls, before and after tap test. Eleven gait parameters were combined in a single quantitative score. Walking velocity was also evaluated, since it is frequently used in tap test assessment. Results: Patients were classified as: (A) tap <b>test</b> <b>responders</b> (n= 22 patients, 9 of them were shunted), or (B) not suitable for shunt (n= 38 patients, 4 of them were shunted). In group A, 9 out of 9 patients improved after shunt. In group B, 3 out of 4 patients did not improve. Gait velocity increased after tap test in 53 % of responders and in 37 % of patients not suitable for shunt. Conclusions: The new method is applicable to the clinical practice and allows for selecting tap <b>test</b> <b>responders</b> in an objective way, quantifying the improvements. Our results suggest that gait velocity alone is not sufficient to reliably assess tap test effect...|$|R

Aim: To {{assess the}} burden of uninvestigated dyspepsia (symptoms, health-related quality of life [HRQL] and work productivity) before and after 8 weeks’ esomeprazole treatment. Methods: Patients (n = 1250) with uninvestigated dyspepsia (no endoscopy within 6 months and ≤ 2 endoscopies within 10 years) underwent a 1 -week esomeprazole acid-suppression test before randomisation to 7 weeks’ esomeprazole or placebo. The Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaires were completed at baseline (1 -week off-treatment) and 8 weeks. WPAI results were further analysed among patients {{who responded to the}} acid-suppression test. Results: The highest baseline symptom score was for the RDQ dyspepsia domain, and the highest disease burden was for QOLRAD vitality and food/drink problems. After 8 weeks, significant improvements vs. placebo were observed for all RDQ and QOLRAD domains. The sub-population of acid-suppression <b>test</b> <b>responders,</b> but not the total WPAI population, had a significant work productivity improvement vs. placebo. Conclusions: Uninvestigated dyspepsia is associated with high symptom load and impacts on HRQL and work productivity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The oral {{prednisolone}} test {{is widely}} used to distinguish {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients who might benefit from inhaled steroid treatment. Previous studies used selected patient groups that did not represent the large COPD population in primary care. METHODS: The study included smokers and exsmokers with chronic bronchitis or COPD from primary care, who underwent prednisolone testing (30 mg for 14 days) before randomization in a three-year follow-up randomized controlled trial (COOPT Study). Spirometry was performed before and after the <b>test.</b> <b>Responders</b> and nonresponders were classified according to international criteria. Effectiveness of inhaled fluticasone relative to placebo was compared in terms of health status (Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire), exacerbations, and postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), using repeated measurement analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-six patients recruited from 44 primary care practices were randomized. Nine percent to 16 % of the COPD population was classified as responder, depending on the international guideline criteria used. On average, responders did not reach the minimum clinically important difference in health status (0. 29 points/year, P = 0. 05), although a borderline significant effect of inhaled fluticasone was noted. Possible clinically relevant reductions in exacerbation rate (rate ratio 0. 67) and FEV(1) decline (39 mL/year) occurred in responders, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Oral steroid testing identifies a limited proportion of COPD patients, but does not reveal any clinically relevant benefit from inhaled steroid treatment on health status.

40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis entered and completed a sequential study of placebo for 1 week, oral indomethacin 25 mg 3 {{times a day}} for 3 weeks, and oral indomethacin 25 mg 3 times a day plus 100 mg indomethacin suppository at night for 3 weeks. Twelve of the patients had previously been classified as responders and eight as nonresponders to indomethacin by an independent assessor. At {{the end of each}} period patients were assessed by a blind observer for duration of morning stiffness, pain score, digital joint size, grip strength, articular index, analgesic tablet usage, and the patient's own overall global assessment and comparative global assessment. In 8 of the 9 <b>tests</b> used <b>responders</b> improved on indomethacin in comparison with placebo, while nonresponders did not improve. There {{were no significant differences between}} responders and nonresponders in the plasma half-life, plasma clearance of indomethacin, protein binding of indomethacin, or urinary excretion of free or conjugated indomethacin. There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in the urinary excretion of 7 HDPA or in the platelet aggregation or platelet malonyldialdehyde production <b>tests.</b> In <b>responders</b> there was a significant positive correlation between the plasma indomethacin concentration (r= 0 · 44, P< 0 · 05) and the percentage inhibition of malonyldialdehyde production by the platelets. However, in nonresponders this correlation, while significant (P< 0 · 05), was negative (r=− 0 · 498). Both for responders and nonresponders there was a significant correlation between plasma indomethacin concentration and the percentage reduction in 7 HDPA. There was no correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of indomethacin. There appears to be a biochemical difference between responders and nonresponders, which, while not necessarily causally linked with the clinical response to indomethacin, is worthy of further study...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} my goal {{has been to}} test whether the {{negative}} feelings which arise from being treated unfairly linger on or fade quickly. My hypothesis {{has been that the}} feelings do, in fact, disappear rather fast, and to test this I conducted two experiment sessions where I tried to induce the proposers in an ultimatum game to behave in an unfair manner in order to <b>test</b> how the <b>responders</b> reacted to this. In the <b>test</b> session the <b>responders</b> experienced a three-minute delay before their decisions were made, and in the control session the decision was to be made immediately. The results show that 73 % of the responders who were given the unfair offer in the test group accepted this offer, whereas this share was only 31 % in the control group. By themselves these numbers clearly support my hypothesis, and the findings were also significant. However, as this was a pre-test of the hypothesis for my supervisor the number of participants in the experiment was low, so the experiment needs to be conducted with more participants and sessions in order to find more robust results.

Main methodsChanges in the nociceptive threshold of intraperitoneal or intrathecal saline- or amitriptyline-treated non-responder rats were evaluated using the tail-flick or incision pain tests before, during and after a 20 -min period of electroacupuncture, applied at 2 Hz to the Zusanli and Sanynjiao acupoints.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer worldwide, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The {{greatest}} risk factor for breast cancer is inheritance of a mutation in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2. Mutation in those genes is also a risk factor for developing ovarian cancer. Early detection of cancer is associated with earlier intervention and more successful outcomes. The aim of our study was to access knowledge and attitudes about genetic testing and mammography screening among supporters of Norwegian Breast Cancer Association. A cross-sectional design was employed. An internet based questionnaire that assessed knowledge of genes and genetic testing, use of genetic testing, personal breast cancer history, attitudes about genetic testing as well as attitudes about mammography screening and sociodemographic characteristics was distributed by Norwegian Breast Cancer Association on their home- and Facebook pages. Two hundred and twenty-five people responded to the survey. On average, respondents answered 7 (IQR 5 - 8) of 11 items on knowledge about BRCA testing correctly. The percentage of correct responses on the knowledge instrument ranged from 18 % to 98 %, with the lowest knowledge on risk of ovarian cancer after a prophylactic surgery. Responders who had undergone BRCA 1 / 2 testing had significantly higher knowledge than those who had not undergone testing (p< 0. 001). In those who had not undergone genetic testing, there was no difference (p= 0. 856) in total score BRCA knowledge between those with personal history of breast cancer (median 6, IQR 4 - 7) and those with no personal history of breast cancer (median 6, IQR 5 - 7). In those who have undergone gene <b>testing,</b> <b>responders</b> with a personal history of breast cancer had significantly lower (p< 0. 001) levels of overall knowledge compared to individuals with no personal history of breast cancer.

The two interfaces illustrate three distinct categories of safety concerns: unsafe control regimes, loss of situation awareness, and increased stress. Five recommendations are proposed to mitigate or eliminate the safety concerns: separate the payload camera from the platform, giving the pilot a dedicated “pilot-cam” and the experts a fully gimbaled payload; use artificial intelligence to resolve conflicts between competing directives from multiple experts; allow the pilot, or a software agent, to turn off the expert’s ability to control or communication; use multi-modal warnings rather than rely on visual cues; and add guarded motion to prevent collisions...|$|R

A grading system for the level of evidence of treatments based on the controlled clinical trials performed with each compound is used to propose an evidence-based treatment algorithm. The algorithm includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies {{for the treatment of}} PAH and/or drugs available for other indications. The different treatments have been evaluated mainly in idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, and in PAH associated with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases or with anorexigen use.

40|$|AbstractResponder {{analysis}} is in common use in clinical trials, {{and has been}} described and endorsed in regulatory guidance documents, especially in trials where “soft” clinical endpoints such as rating scales are used. The procedure is useful, because responder rates can be understood more intuitively than a difference in means of rating scales. However, two major issues arise: 1) such dichotomized outcomes are inefficient {{in terms of using}} the information available and can seriously reduce the power of the study; and 2) the results of clinical trials depend considerably on the response cutoff chosen, yet in many disease areas there is no consensus as to what is the most appropriate cutoff. This article addresses these two issues, offering a novel approach for responder analysis that could both improve the power of responder analysis and explore different responder cutoffs if an agreed-upon common cutoff is not present. Specifically, we propose a statistically rigorous clinical trial design that pre-specifies multiple <b>tests</b> of <b>responder</b> rates between treatment groups based on a range of pre-specified responder cutoffs, and uses the minimum of the p-values for formal inference. The critical value for hypothesis testing comes from permutation distributions. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. We demonstrate that the new method substantially improves the power of responder analysis, and in certain cases, yields power that is approaching the analysis using the original continuous (or ordinal) measure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} value of time-intensity curves {{obtained}} after sulphur hefluoride-filled microbubble contrast agent injection to discriminate responders from non-responders among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Forty-three patients (29 male and 14 female; mean age[*]±[*]SD, 48. 5 [*]±[*] 17. 17 years) with initial diagnosis of active CD were recruited. In each patient, the therapeutic outcome was assessed after 12 weeks {{from the beginning of}} pharmacologic treatment. The terminal ileal loop was scanned after sulphur hexafluoride-filled microbubble injection, and the digital cine-clip registered during the first-pass dynamic enhancement was quantified in gray-scale levels. The percentage of maximal enhancement, time to peak enhancement, and area under the time-intensity curve in responders vs. non-responders were compared by Mann-Whitney U non-parametric <b>test.</b> RESULTS: <b>Responders</b> (n[*]=[*] 25 patients) vs. non-responders (n[*]=[*] 18) differed in the area under the time-intensity curve (621. 58 [*]±[*] 374. 53 vs. 1, 199. 64 [*]±[*] 386. 39 P[*]<[*] 0. 05), while they did not differ in percentage of maximal enhancement (41. 26 [*]±[*] 15. 22 vs. 43. 17 [*]±[*] 4. 41, P[*]=[*] 0. 25) and time to peak enhancement (11. 31 [*]±[*] 3. 06 vs. 10. 12 [*]±[*] 3. 47, P[*]=[*] 0. 15).

40|$|AIM—To {{explore the}} time of onset and {{duration}} of action of topical amethocaine gel in the newborn infant.  DESIGN—A randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.  SUBJECTS—Thirty six infants were studied after 30 minutes application and 36 after 60 minutes application. A total of 56 infants (gestation 27 - 42 weeks, weight 0. 79 - 4. 1 kg) were studied {{in the first two}} weeks after delivery.  METHOD— 1. 5 g amethocaine or placebo was applied to the dorsum of either foot, occluded, and then left for 30 or 60 minutes. Local anaesthesia was assessed by observing the cutaneous withdrawal response to graded nylon filaments (von Frey hairs). If there was a difference between feet in filament thickness required to elicit a response, the infant was studied in an identical manner at hourly intervals until the difference had disappeared.  RESULTS—Evidence of local anaesthetic action of amethocaine was seen in 23 of 36 (64 %) infants after 30 minutes and 26 of 36 (72 %) infants after 60 minutes application (no significant difference). Evidence of local anaesthetic action was independent of gestation and order of <b>testing.</b> Amethocaine <b>responders</b> showed a significantly deeper anaesthetic action than placebo responders. The median duration of action was 1. 5 hours (range 0. 5 - 3. 5) after 30 minutes and three hours (range 1 - 5) after 60 minutes (p < 0. 001).  CONCLUSION—Topical amethocaine gel has a local anaesthetic action after 30 minutes application, but application for 60 minutes results in longer duration of action. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a homogeneous format reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for quantitating hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA {{based on the}} TaqMan principle, in which signal is generated by cleaving a target-specific probe during amplification. The test uses two probes, one specific for HCV and one specific for an internal control, containing fluorophores with different emission spectra. Titers are calculated in international units (IU) /ml by comparing the HCV signal generated by test samples to that generated {{by a set of}} external standards. Endpoint titration experiments demonstrated that samples containing 28 IU/ml give positive results 95 % of the time. Based on these data, the limit of detection was set conservatively at 40 IU/ml. All HCV genotypes were amplified with equal efficiency and accurately quantitated: when equal quantities of RNA were tested, each genotype produced virtually identical fluorescent signals. The test exhibited a linear range extending from 64 to 4, 180, 000 IU/ml and excellent reproducibility, with coefficients of variation ranging from 21. 6 to 30. 4 %, which implies that titers that differ by a factor of twofold (0. 3 log 10) are statistically significant (P = 0. 005). The test did not react with other organisms likely to co-infect patients with hepatitis C and exhibited a specificity of 99 % when evaluated on a set of samples from HCV seronegative blood donors. In interferon-treated patients, the patterns of viral load changes revealed by the TaqMan HCV quantitative <b>test</b> distinguished <b>responders</b> from nonresponders and responder-relapsers. These data indicate that the TaqMan quantitative HCV test provides an attractive alternative for measuring HCV viral load and should prove useful for prognosis and for monitoring the efficacy of antiviral treatments...|$|R
30|$|Results: Twenty-nine {{patients}} were included, 20 being fluid responders (fluid-induced increase in cardiac index 15 %) and 9 fluid non-responders. The IAP at baseline was 20  ±  6  mmHg. It significantly decreased during the PLR <b>test</b> in fluid <b>responders</b> (by 34  ±  13 %) and in fluid non-responders (by 30  ±  16 %). In fluid responders, cardiac index increased by 7  ±  9 % during PLR and by 22  ±  6 % during volume expansion. The PLR test was negative (PLR-induced increase in cardiac index <  10 %) in 15 patients (false negatives) and positive in 5 patients (true positives). In fluid non-responders, cardiac index increased by 6  ±  6 % during PLR and 6  ±  3 % during VE. The PLR test was negative {{in all but}} one of them was positive (false positive). The sensitivity and specificity of the PLR test to detect fluid responsiveness were 40 % (95 % confidence interval 19 – 64) and 89 % (52 – 100), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58  ±  0.11.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{numerous}} controlled {{clinical trials}} performed recently in {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} (PAH) can allow us to abandon a clinical-based treatment strategy and adopt an evidence-based therapy. Both uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials with different compounds and procedures are reviewed and compared in order to define the efficacy-to-side-effect ratio of each treatment. A grading system for the level of evidence of treatments {{based on the number}} of favorable controlled clinical trials performed with a given compound is adopted; a treatment algorithm based on the evidence derived by clinical trials is proposed. It includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of patients with PAH and/or drugs available on the market for other indications. The algorithm is restricted to patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV because they represent the largest population included in controlled clinical trials. In addition, the different treatments have been evaluated mainly in sporadic, idiopathic PAH and in PAH associated with scleroderma or to anorexigen use. Extrapolation of these recommendations to the other PAH subgroups should be done with caution. Oral anticoagulation is proposed for all patients, whereas diuretic treatment and supplemental oxygen are indicated in cases of fluid retention and hypoxemia, respectively. High doses of calcium channel blockers are indicated only in the minority of patients who are responders to acute vasoreactivity testing. Nonresponders to acute vasoreactivity <b>testing,</b> or <b>responders</b> who remain in NYHA functional class III, should be considered candidates for treatment with either an endothelin receptor antagonist or a prostanoid. Continuous intravenous administration of epoprostenol is proposed as rescue treatment in NYHA functional class IV patients. Phosphodiesterase-V inhibitors should be considered in patients who have failed or are not candidates to other therapies. Combination therapy can be attempted in selected cases.

40|$|Aggregation is a {{defensive}} strategy employed by many prey species {{in response to}} predatory threat. Our group has characterized defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus {{in response to a}} ball of cat fur. In this situation some rats huddle less, and approach the threatening cue more than others (active vs. passive responders). The present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters. The neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding. Active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur, and were predicted by anxiety-like behavior in an open-field emergence <b>test.</b> Active <b>responders</b> displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat, and had higher post-exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution (a test of "anhedonia"). Active responding was associated with: greater cat fur-induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb, reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur; lowered activation of somatosensory cortex, reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics; and reduced activation in the lateral septum. Social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure, and lowered c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey, medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula. We conclude that individual differences in anti-predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype. Social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect, subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding. An association between active responding and lower c-Fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation. 15 page(s...|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} the {{enrolled}} patients was referred to similar studies evaluating the prediction ability of IJVV [17 – 19]. All continuous variables except the doses of norepinephrine and dobutamine were normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). The results are expressed as the mean ± SD (standard deviation) or median (25 – 75 % inter-quartile range, IQR) as appropriate. After checking the homogeneity of variance for each parameter, the difference between values was compared using the independent sample t test, and the comparisons of hemodynamic variables between the different study times were assessed using paired Student t <b>tests.</b> Comparisons between <b>responders</b> and non-responders were assessed using two-sample Student’s t tests. P values <  0.05 were considered statistically significant. Correlations were assessed by Pearson coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic and static indicators in predicting fluid responsiveness. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were compared using DeLong and colleagues’ test. The optimal cutoff of each variable was estimated by maximizing the Youden index. A difference between two AUCs was considered statistically significant, when the P value of DeLong and colleagues’ test was <  0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with the MedCalc 8.1. 0.0 (Mariakerke, Belgium) and SPSS software (19.0).|$|R
40|$|Sky Writer is a {{collaborative}} communication medium that augments the traditional display of a UAV pilot and allows other stakeholders to communicate {{their needs and}} intentions to the pilot. UAV pilots engaging in time-critical missions, such as urban disaster responses, often must allocate most of their cognitive capacity towards flight tasks, making communication and collaboration with other stakeholders difficult or dangerous. Sky Writer addresses the needs of stakeholders while requiring minimal cognitive effort from the UAV pilot. The application presents stakeholders with an interface that provides contextual flight information and a live video stream of the flight. Stakeholders are able to sketch directly on the video stream or use a spotlight indicator that is mirrored across all displays in the system, including the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s display. The application {{can be used in}} any modern web browser and works with traditional and touch devices. Concept experimentation performed at Disaster City with two pilots indicated that the spotlight feature was particularly useful while the UAV was in motion, and the sketching features were most useful while the UAV was stationary. The system will be <b>tested</b> with professional <b>responders</b> soon to determine its efficacy in a simulated response, and to inform the ongoing design process...|$|R
40|$|Background. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{patients}} have a poor {{response to the}} voices of caregivers. After administration of donepezil, caregivers often find that patients respond more frequently, whereas they had previously pretended to be “deaf. ” We investigated whether auditory selective attention is associated with response to donepezil. Methods. The subjects were 40 AD patients, 20 elderly healthy controls (HCs), and 15 young HCs. Pure tone audiometry was conducted and an original Auditory Selective Attention (ASA) test was performed with a MoCA vigilance test. Reassessment of the AD group was performed after donepezil treatment for 3 months. Results. Hearing level of the AD group {{was the same as}} that of the elderly HC group. However, ASA test scores decreased in the AD group and were correlated with the vigilance <b>test</b> scores. Donepezil <b>responders</b> (MMSE 3 +) also showed improvement on the ASA test. At baseline, the responders had higher vigilance and lower ASA test scores. Conclusion. Contrary to the common view, AD patients had a similar level of hearing ability to healthy elderly. Auditory attention was impaired in AD patients, which suggests that unnecessary sounds should be avoided in nursing homes. Auditory selective attention is associated with response to donepezil in AD...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{baseline}} sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) variables and treatment-related sleep changes after 35 - 46 days of amitryptiline treatment (AMI) {{in a group}} of 18 depressed inpatients, mostly suffering from major depressive disorder endogenous sybtype (according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, RDC), with a short rapid eye movement (REM) latency. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify potential sleep 'predictors' of clinical response to AMI as well as short-term sleep changes associated with alleviation of depression. Clinical response to the drug was defined as a reduction of more than 50 % of the Hamilton Rating Score for Depression (HRSD). Eleven men and 7 women, 25 - 68 years old, were included in the study. Their sleep was recorded at baseline and after an average of 39 ± 4 days of AMI treatment, at a mean daily dose of 165 ± 35 mg. The comparison of responders (n = 9) and nonresponders (n = 9) with Wilcoxon's <b>test</b> showed that <b>responders</b> (1) were more severely depressed at baseline, and (2) had less stage 4 sleep. A discriminant function using baseline HRSD, stage 4 and the number of stage shifts allowed for discrimination between responders and nonresponders with a 100 % hit rate. Antidepressant treatment had, however, no differential effect on sleep parameters in the two response groups. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
