40|$|Experimental {{thrombocytopenia}} {{results in}} endothelial alterations associated with bleeding. In this study prednisone {{was shown to}} prevent or reverse these changes, which supports the clinical inference that adrenocorticosteroids decrease capillary fragility in thrombocytopenia. Rabbits (3 - 4 kg), intraperitoneally injected with busulfan, developed 98 - 99 % reductions in platelet count and hemorrhaged profusely. Orally administered prednisone (0. 2 mg/kg or 1. 0 mg/kg daily) reduced bleeding despite persistent thrombocytopenia. Tongue biopsies obtained after 3 days of prednisone treatment were examined by electron microscopy. Normal rabbits served as controls. 25 consecutive capillaries or venules from each of four animals {{in the control group}} and each of five experimental groups were examined for fenestrations, “thin spots” (< 800 A thick), and mean wall thickness as determined by planimetry. Vessels from control animals had no <b>thin</b> <b>spots</b> or fenestrations, and the mean vessel wall thickness was 4, 254 ± 105 A SEM. The 100 vessels from the thrombocytopenic animals had a mean vessel wall thickness of 2, 081 ± 218 A (P < 0. 001), and 42 had <b>thin</b> <b>spots</b> of fenestrations. After administration of the smaller dosage of prednisone, the mean vessel wall thickness increased to 3, 556 ± 40 A (P < 0. 001), and only nine vessels had <b>thin</b> <b>spots</b> or fenestrations. With the larger dosage, only six vessels had <b>thin</b> <b>spots</b> or fenestrations and the mean vessel wall thickness of this group increased to 3, 704 ± 206 A (P < 0. 005). All preparations demonstrated normal endothelial junctions. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the bleeding of thrombocytopenia is caused by altered capillary and venule endothelium and that diminished bleeding observed with prednisone administration results from amelioration of these endothelial changes...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a reduced-order {{model is}} {{constructed}} {{to study the}} physiological flow and wall shear stress conditions for aneurysms. The method of local proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to construct the reduced-order modes using a series of CFD results, which are subsequently improved using a QR-factorization technique to satisfy the various boundary conditions in physiological flow problems. This method can effectively construct a computationally efficient physiological model, which allows us to examine the fluid velocities and wall shear stress distributions over a range of different physiological flow parameters. Aneurysms are the dilation, bulging, or ballooning-out of part of {{the wall of a}} human artery. Repetitive forces on an existing aneurysm can lead either to its gradual expansion or to a devastating event of rupture. Traditionally, clinicians use the largest diameter as the sole parameter for standard risk stratification outside of clinical trials. However, {{there seems to be no}} safe small aneurysm size and a more accurate answer depends on the exact distributions of material and geometrical properties of the aneurysms. Aneurysms can have a very non-uniform distribution of thickness, modulus, and failure tension. We focus on the thins-shell fluid-structures interactions (FSI) with thickness inhomogeneity by studying the influence of one or multiple <b>thin</b> <b>spots</b> on the flow-induced instabilities of flexile shells of revolution with non-zero Gaussian curvatures. The results show that for shells with positive Gaussian curvatures conveying fluid, the existence of a <b>thin</b> <b>spot</b> results in a localized flow-induced buckling response of the shell in the neighborhood of the <b>thin</b> <b>spot,</b> and significantly reduces the critical flow velocity for buckling instability. For shells with negative Gaussian curvatures, the buckling response is extended along the shell’s characteristic lines and the critical flow velocity is only slightly reduced. Finally, the shell model with non-uniform thickness is combined with the ROM of hemodynamic loads. We show that based on a growth and remodeling (G 2 ̆ 6 R) model, the rate of aneurysmal wall’s elastin degradation can be predicted efficiently with various degrees of thickness inhomogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Hog {{production}} and marketing {{practices in the}} U. S. pork industry have changed dramatically {{over the past two}} decades. In the early 1990 s, nearly 90 % of hogs were purchased in the spot market through auctions, dealers or directly by packers. By early 2010, the percent of spot market hogs had fallen to 5 - 7 %. Approximately 25 % of hogs are owned and processed by packers in their own plants and 70 % of hogs are traded between seller and buyer through marketing contracts. The contracts vary in duration and specification but are similar in that the transaction price is derived by a formula based on another market, often the now very <b>thin</b> <b>spot</b> market. The motivations of sellers and buyers to abandon the spot market may still exist, but the <b>thin</b> <b>spot</b> market raises concerns. Prices in these thin markets potentially may become highly volatile, subject to manipulation, and less representative of competitive market equilibrium (Martinez, 1999). Some producers and Congress are looking to reverse the trend by requiring packers to purchase a percentage of their needs in the spot market (Taylor, Muth and Koontz, 2007). Yet, other producers that value contracting are evolving to the next generation of contracts and alternative methods of price discover...|$|R
