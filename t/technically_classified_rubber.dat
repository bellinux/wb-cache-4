50|$|A two axis {{magnetometer}} {{was mounted}} to the ATS-1 (Applications Technology Satellite). One sensor {{was on a}} 15 cm boom {{and the other on}} the spacecraft's spin axis (Spin stabilized satellite). The sun was used to sense the position of the boom mounted device, and triaxial vector measurements could be calculated. Compared to other boom mounted magnetometers, this configuration had considerable interference. Interestingly with this spacecraft, the sun induce magnetic oscillations and this allowed the continued use of the magnetometer after the sun sensor failed. Explorer 10 had two fluxgate magnetometers but is <b>technically</b> <b>classified</b> as a dual technique since it also had a rubidium vapor magnetometer.|$|R
