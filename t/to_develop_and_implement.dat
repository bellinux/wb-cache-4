40|$|High-fidelity full system {{simulations}} {{have the}} potential for revolutionizing the way complex systems, such as propulsion systems for aerospace vehicles, are designed, <b>developed,</b> manufactured, <b>and</b> operated. Significant time and cost savings will result from simulations that will resolve deleterious component interactions early in the design process. In addition, innovative new system configurations will result from the use of new tools that enable designers to challenge traditional rules and practices. The major challenges <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> high-fidelity systems simulations are in reducing the time and effort required to build, execute, and analyze data for the high complex simulations. In addition, large scale testing with unique instrumentation is required to validate the simulations.

The following presentation describes in more detail the benefits of high-fidelity full system simulations, the challenges <b>to</b> <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> large scale simulations, and one approach that is being followed by the NASA Glenn Research Center to overcome these challenges.
