This general aim is being tackled while acknowledging that decentralization is a multi-dimensional concept, of which the fiscal one is imbedded in a wider political and economic context.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} demand {{response}} to non-linear price schedules using data on insurance contacts and prescription drug claims in Medicare Part D. Consistent with static response {{of drug use}} to price, we document significant bunching of annual drug spending as individuals enter the famous “donut hole, ” where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous on the margin. Consistent with a dynamic response to price, we document a response of drug use to the future out-of-pocket price by using variation in beneficiary birth month which generates variation in contract duration {{during the first year}} of eligibility. Motivated by these two facts, we develop and estimate a dynamic model of drug use during the coverage year that allows us to explore and quantify the effects of alternative contract designs on drug expenditures. For example, our estimates suggest that “filling ” the donut hole, as required under the Affordable Care Act, will increase average total drug spending by about $ 170 <b>per</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> or about 10 %, and average Medicare drug spending by about $ 270 <b>per</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> or almost 30 %.

40|$|Child Health Days (CHDs) are twice-annual campaign-style events {{designed}} to increase the coverage of vitamin A and one or more other child health services. Although {{more than two dozen}} countries have had a CHD, little has been published about them. This paper presents an activity-based costing study of Ethiopia’s version of CHDs, the Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EOS). The December 2006 round reached more than 10 million beneficiaries at an average cost <b>per</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of US$ 0. 56. When measles is added, the cost of the package doubles. Given the way the distribution day delivery system and the service package are structured, there are economies of scope. Because most of the costs are determined by the number of delivery sites and are independent of the number of beneficiaries, other things equal, increasing the beneficiaries would reduce the average cost <b>per</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Taking into account only the mortality impact of vitamin A, EOS saved 20 200 lives and averted 230 000 DALYs of children 6 – 59 months. The average cost per life saved was US$ 228 and the cost per DALY averted was equivalent to 6 % of per capita GDP (US$ 9) ...|$|R
