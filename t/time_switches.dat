50|$|The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) {{connects to}} the {{concentrator}} and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of <b>Time</b> <b>Switches</b> and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to <b>Time</b> <b>Switches.</b> The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual <b>Time</b> <b>Switches</b> are connected to each other by a Space Switch. The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS).|$|E
50|$|In 1910, {{the company}} was founded by Fritz Sauter in Grindelwald (CH) as a {{manufacturer}} of electrical <b>time</b> <b>switches.</b> The growing number of incoming orders led to an expansion and relocation of the operation to Basel.

50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>switches</b> can be {{used for}} many purposes, {{including}} saving electric energy by consuming it only when required, switching equipment on, off, or both at times required by some process, and home security (for example switching lights in a pattern that gives the impression that premises are attended) to reduce the likelihood of burglary or prowling.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a denoise-and-forward (DNF) two-way relay network (TWRN) with non-coherent differential binary phase-shift keying modulation, where a battery-free relay node harvests {{energy from the}} received radio frequency (RF) signals and uses the harvested energy to help the source nodes for information exchange. Based on the power splitting (PS) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> (TS) receiver architectures, power splitting relaying (PSR) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> relaying (TSR) protocols at relay are studied. In order to investigate the effect of power allocations on two source nodes, power splitting coefficient and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor at relay on performance, the two proposed protocols are analyzed and the bit error rate (BER) expressions of end-to-end system are derived. Based on these expressions, the optimal power of sources, the power splitting ratio and the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor are obtained via the numerical search method. The simulation and numerical results provide practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as the power splitting coefficient, the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor, sources to relay distances, the noise power, and the energy harvesting efficiency {{on the performance of}} this TWRN. In addition, the results show that the PSR protocol outperforms the TSR protocol in terms of throughput under various network geometries.|$|R

In the second stage, the energy beamforming vector wk and the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> ratio α are solved simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|The solar dial {{time switch}} {{has largely been}} {{superseded}} by photocell control, which is cheaper and requires less maintenance.

30|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} through radio frequency (RF) signals {{has emerged as}} the promising and effective solution to supply power and prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless networks. Since RF signals can carry both information and energy, it has recently attracted a lot of attention on research activities, especially on investigating simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [1 – 3]. In [4], an energy constrained relay node using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol was considered based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> and power splitting receiver architectures, respectively. Specifically, the authors investigated both the delay-limited and the non-delay-limited transmission and derived the analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity, respectively. Later on, the same authors extended the analysis to the throughput and ergodic capacity of DF relaying systems in [5]. Based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> receiver architecture, the authors in [6] proposed adaptive <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols for RF energy harvesting and information transmission for both AF and DF networks. They obtained analytical expressions of the achievable throughput for both the continuous and the discrete <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols. It is pointing out that these authors only consider half-duplex relaying mechanism, where relay node cannot receive and transmit data simultaneously in the same frequency band.|$|R

For example, {{the exploration of the}} abnormal transmission was investigated at the network sensor node under the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> scheme, while a normal transmission was studied at the network sensor node using the power splitting scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Inose {{was well}} known, internationally, for his {{invention}} of the TSI system {{while he was at}} AT&T Bell Laboratories. The idea of the TSI was to implement <b>time</b> <b>switches</b> into digital switching systems. The system collects data and stores them in a time slot and allows the time slot to be interchanged with another. It contains one physical input and one physical output. [...] "He built a prototype digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) electronic switching system called CAMPUS, which is based on the TSI principle..." [...] Although this invention was crucial, it did not receive much recognition due to costly memory devices. Later in the 1970s when semiconductor technologies began advancing, TSI received more recognition. Since its first commercial deployment in 1976, it has been popular and utilized amongst the digital central office switching systems and digital private branch exchanges.|$|E

50|$|The driver {{can also}} select several driving modes: SPORT, COMFORT and ECO PRO. Using the gear selector, the driver can either select {{position}} D for automated gear selection or can switch to SPORT mode. SPORT mode offers manual gear selection {{and at the}} same <b>time</b> <b>switches</b> to very sporty drive and suspension settings. In SPORT mode, the engine and electric motor deliver extra performance, accelerator response is faster and the power boost from the electric motor is maximized. And to keep the battery topped up, SPORT mode also activates maximum energy recuperation during overrun and braking as the electric motor’s generator function, which recharges the battery using kinetic energy, switches to a more powerful setting. The Driving Experience Control switch on the center console offers a choice of two settings. On starting, COMFORT mode is activated, which offers a balance between sporty performance and fuel efficiency, with unrestricted access to all convenience functions. Alternatively, the ECO PRO mode can be engaged, which, on the BMW i8 as on other models, supports an efficiency-optimized driving style. On this mode the powertrain controller coordinates the cooperation between the gasoline engine and the electric motor for maximum fuel economy. On deceleration, the intelligent energy management system automatically decides, in line with the driving situation and vehicle status, whether to recuperate braking energy or to coast with the powertrain disengaged. At the same time, ECO PRO mode also programs electrical convenience functions such as the air conditioning, seat heating and heated mirrors to operate at minimum power consumption, but without compromising safety. The maximum driving range of the BMW i8 on a full fuel tank and with a fully charged battery is more than 500 km in COMFORT mode, which can be increased by up to 20% in ECO PRO mode. The BMW i8’s ECO PRO mode can also be used during all-electric operation. The vehicle is then powered solely by the electric motor. Only if the battery charge drops below a given level, or under sudden intense throttle application such as kickdown, is the internal combustion engine automatically activated.|$|E
