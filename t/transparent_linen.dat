The paintings utilized everyday household objects such as folding chairs and china plates juxtaposed with <b>transparent</b> <b>linen</b> stretched over window-like frames.|$|E
50|$|Venus and Cupid (Sleeping Venus) is a circa 1626 {{painting}} by Artemisia Gentileschi in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Venus and Cupid is a {{depiction of a}} sleeping Venus, who reclines on a blue bed covering and rich crimson and gold tasseled pillow. She wears nothing except a thin wisp of <b>transparent</b> <b>linen</b> around her thigh. Her son Cupid fans her with richly colored peacock feathers as she drifts to sleep. He is gazing at her with an adored, raptured expression. In the background, there is a window looking out onto a moonlight landscape where a temple to the goddess lies. Venus’s face has full cheeks, heavy lids, a prominent nose, and small protruding chin—all features of Gentileschi's own face. The body movements are natural: Venus’s hand rests lightly on her side, her legs are gently laid together. The work blends together realism and classicism through its iconography and the artist’s style.|$|E
5000|$|The Merveilleuses scandalized Paris with {{dresses and}} tunics {{modeled after the}} ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even <b>transparent</b> <b>linen</b> and gauze. Sometimes so {{revealing}} they were termed [...] "woven air", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as [...] "Our Lady of Thermidor", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.|$|E

That {{this tree}} {{should have been}} the only one which [...] "the Aryans, coming as conquerors from the North, were able to {{recognize}} in Hindustan,"[45] and should therefore also be [...] "the only one whose name is common to Sanskrit, and to the languages of Europe," [...] delighted me greatly, for two reasons: the first, for its proof that in spite of the development of species, the sweet gleaming of birch stem has never changed its argent and sable for any unchequered heraldry; and the second, that it gave proof of a much more important fact, the keenly accurate observation of Aryan foresters at that early date; for {{the fact is that the}} breaking of the thin-beaten silver of the birch trunk is so delicate, and its smoothness so graceful, that until I painted it with care, I was not altogether clear-headed myself about the way in which the chequering was done: nor until Fors today brought me to the house of one of my father's friends at Carshalton, and gave me three birch stems to look at just outside the window, did I perceive it to be a primal question about them, what it is that blanches that dainty dress of theirs, or, anticipatorily, weaves. What difference is there between the making of the corky excrescence of other {173} trees, and of this almost <b>transparent</b> fine white <b>linen?</b> I perceive that the older it is, within limits, the finer and whiter; hoary tissue, instead of hoary hair--honouring the tree's aged body; the outer sprays have no silvery light on their youth. Does the membrane thin itself into whiteness merely by stretching, or produce an outer film of new substance?[46] ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Jacobins and their Sans-culottes {{supporters}}, the supporters of the Thermidorian Reaction were known as the Incroyables and Merveilleuses. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes. The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even <b>transparent</b> <b>linen</b> and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed [...] "woven air", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as [...] "Our Lady of Thermidor", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs. The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by [...] "dog ears", their hair falling on their ears. Their musk-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname muscadins among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-Jacobins. They wore bicorne hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their [...] "executive power." [...] Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture.|$|E
