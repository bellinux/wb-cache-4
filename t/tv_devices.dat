Smart <b>TV</b> <b>devices</b> facilitate the curation of traditional content by combining information from the Internet with content from TV providers. Services offer users a means to track and receive reminders about shows or sporting events, {{as well as the}} ability to change channels for immediate viewing. Some devices feature additional interactive organic user interface / natural user interface technologies for navigation controls and other human interaction with a Smart TV, with such as second screen companion devices, spatial gestures input like with Xbox Kinect, and even for speech recognition for natural language user interface.|$|E

25|$|On 2 March 2011, Virgin {{released}} an iPlayer application for their TiVo digital video recorder. Unlike the previous implementation, the application streams {{over the internet}} rather than utilising Virgin's video-on-demand service, {{to comply with the}} BBC's then proposed syndication policy. The change also allows an increase in the amount of programmes available, from around 300 to 700 hours on average, bringing Virgin into line with the iPlayer on connected <b>TV</b> <b>devices.</b> At the same time, Virgin Media were also forced to remove direct access to BBC content on TiVo, meaning that instead of being able to access BBC content through its EPG, Virgin TiVo users instead had to go through the Apps and Games area or press the Red Button from a BBC channel. This access was reimplemented with the release of TiVo update 15.2 in late 2011, which integrated BBC iPlayer once again into the TiVo search and EPG after new guidelines on syndicated content were published by the BBC Trust.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{lifetime}} and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced cultural critics, thinkers, and media theorists such as Neil Postman, Jean Baudrillard, Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna, William Irwin Thompson, Paul Levinson, Douglas Rushkoff, Jaron Lanier, Hugh Kenner, and John David Ebert, {{as well as}} political leaders such as Pierre Elliott Trudeau [...] and Jerry Brown. Andy Warhol was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous [...] "15 minutes of fame" [...] quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in Angola, he suggested a massive spread of <b>TV</b> <b>devices.</b> [...] The character [...] "Brian O'Blivion" [...] in David Cronenberg's 1983 film Videodrome is a [...] "media oracle" [...] based on McLuhan. [...] In 1991, McLuhan was named as the [...] "patron saint" [...] of Wired Magazine and a quote of his appeared on the masthead for the first ten years of its publication. He is mentioned by name in a Peter Gabriel-penned lyric in the song [...] "Broadway Melody of 1974". [...] This song appears on the concept album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, from progressive rock band Genesis. [...] The lyric is: [...] "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand." [...] McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of The Sopranos entitled [...] "House Arrest". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a Wired mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for Wired that [...] "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective." ...|$|E

BDA is documented in the Windows DDK (Driver Development Kit) and the Platform SDK. Ideally, any BDA-compliant software should be compatible with any BDA-compliant hardware.|$|R
