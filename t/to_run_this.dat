25|$|Tuscania carried {{passengers}} between New York City and Glasgow {{while in}} service with the Anchor Line, on a route {{that had previously}} been assigned to her sister ship Transylvania.

25|$|The {{trip was}} a trying {{experience}} but perhaps more valuable {{in some ways}} than formal training. The soldiers quickly turned sea-men. Between Mobile and Key West the crew learned to spit to leeward and talk in terms of decks, bulkheads, and ladders. Morale was not so high, however, among the more experienced officers who knew ships and had <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>this</b> one.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the right}} side of the {{instrument}} panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing RS-232 serial communication, into which a computer can be plugged into to download engine monitoring information. The software <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>this</b> is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in a digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E
25|$|After her {{election}} to the 69th Congress, Rogers was reelected to the 70th, 71st, 72nd, 73rd, 74th, 75th, 76th, 77th, 78th, 79th, 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th, 85th, and 86th Congresses. She continued to win with strong majorities, serving a total of 35 years and 18 consecutive terms, until her death on September 10, 1960. She was considered a formidable candidate for US Senate in 1958 against the much younger John F. Kennedy, but decided not <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> <b>This</b> was the longest tenure of any woman elected to the United States Congress, until surpassed by Barbara Mikulski in 2012. Like her husband, she served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and also on the Civil Service Committee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. She chaired the Committee on Veterans' Affairs from 1947 to 1948 and again from 1953 to 1954, during the 80th and 83rd Congresses.

25|$|On 7 March 1918, {{the promised}} {{reinforcements}} {{were reduced to}} just one Indian division and four batteries of 6-inch howitzers from Mesopotamia due to arrive {{by the end of}} May. Further, Indian infantry battalions and cavalry regiments based in France were, during March and April, to be substituted for British infantry and mounted formations which had had long experience serving in Palestine; they would go to the Western Front. Four additional aircraft squadrons were, however, promised for the coming summer, in addition to squadrons then being formed and a Canadian construction battalion was to be sent from France as soon as its replacement, in the process of formation in Canada, arrived on the Western Front. Also promised were enough railway track to complete the doubling of the railway to Rafa and a single line beyond Haifa. By July it was hoped that 152 locomotives and 3,245 wagons would be available, with a promise of more if required; railway personnel and labour <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>this</b> railway were to come from Mesopotamia.|$|E

Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him, {{but the majority of}} the show's crew and writing staff stayed on. Kilborn's last show as host aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386 episode tenure. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart's debut four weeks later.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) met with NBC on December 6 to discuss this and other issues. NBC told GLAAD that the cancellation was prompted by [...] "Lifestories" [...] low ratings and that the feeling about a boy requiring {{a bone marrow transplant}} would have more appeal at the show's 8pm Sunday time slot. [...] GLAAD asked that the [...] "Lifestories" [...] AIDS episode be rescheduled immediately. They also requested a mother meeting to discuss programming, to which NBC agreed.

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>this</b> particular asylum".|$|E

[...] Following a protest march, the Cuban government erected a large number of poles, carrying black flags with single white stars, obscuring the messages.

2500|$|Since {{the right}} engine had backfired during the {{maintenance}} check in San Juan, 13 new spark plugs (AC-LS-87) were installed. The AC-LS-87 sparkplug accounted for 30 of the 36 {{required for the}} engine <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> <b>This</b> type of sparkplug was not approved {{for use in the}} Curtiss C-46A by the engine manufacturer or the United States Air Forces (which specifically prohibited the use of this type of sparkplug in the C-46A's Pratt and Whitney engines). Furthermore, the rear right engine sparkplugs suffered from extreme heat damage. This was linked to the right engine ignition switch found in the left magneto position, only allowing the rear sparkplugs to fire. Finally, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) determined [...] "the spark plug terminals for this engine were found to be oily and dirty and spark plug electrodes were found to have too much clearance." ...|$|E
