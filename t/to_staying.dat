Sherman looked forward <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> with his wife at home for an extended period {{for the first time in}} years, when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E

Another popular practice of the cunning folk was the casting of spells or charms to ensure a spouse's fidelity, preventing them from committing adultery, for instance, a cunning man from Newcastle, Peter Banks, was charged in 1673–74 for offering to draw up a magical contract which would bind a husband <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> loyal to his wife for a year.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> {{below the}} arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E
25|$|After a {{year without}} ice hockey, a new {{franchise}} named the Newcastle Vipers was formed {{for the start}} of the 2002/03 season, and used the arena as their home rink. After suffering financial difficulties and being unable to attract enough spectators to afford the rent, the Vipers moved home mid-season in November 2009, leaving the arena to move to Whitley Bay Ice Rink, as tenants of the Warriors. While the club were hopeful of a return to the arena, a permanent home in Gateshead was also mooted, with redevelopment proposals tabled during early 2010. A hoped for return to the arena for the 2010/11 season did not occur, as it could not guarantee sufficient dates due to problems with the ageing ice making equipment, seeing the club commit <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> at Whitley Bay.|$|E
25|$|Joseph and Emma {{returned}} to Harmony for a time, but relations with Emma's parents broke down, {{and the couple}} went back <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> {{in the homes of}} members of the growing church.

It was here on April 30, 1831, that Emma gave premature birth to twins, Thaddeus and Louisa; both babies died hours later. That same day, Julia Clapp Murdock died giving birth to twins, Joseph and Julia. When the twins were nine days old, their father, John, gave the infants to the Smiths to raise as their own. On September 2, 1831, the Smiths moved into John Johnson's home in Hiram, Ohio. The infant Joseph died of exposure or pneumonia in late March 1832, after a door was left open during a mob attack on Smith.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{of nurses}} is {{important}} to reduce turnover rate and to improve the stability of hospital. Quality of nursing work life (QNWL) {{has been found to}} influence intention <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> However, reliable information of this effect is limited. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop the model of intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> for temporary nursing staff in RS UNAIR. Method: Anexplanative cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. Data were collected by using questionnaire among 32 nurses working at different units in this hospital through simple random sampling and analyzed by partial least square (PLS). Result: QNWL affected job satisfaction but did not affect commitment. Commitment was significantly affected by job satisfaction. There was effect of job satisfaction on intention <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> Commitment also significantly affected intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> Discussion: QNWL is a predictor of intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> trough job satisfaction and commitment. It is recommended that more focused interventions on QNWL, job satisfaction, and commitment developments may improve intention <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> Recruitment of non-nursing staff to carry out billing and administrative tasks is urgently needed. Suggestions for further research is to analyze the effect of empowerment, remuneration, and career ladder on nurses 2 ̆ 7 intention <b>to</b> <b>stay...</b>|$|R
