5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|In bed, Marge gives Homer a {{magazine}} quiz about his drinking. Hearing Homer's answers, Marge asks {{him to give}} up beer for a month, to which he agrees. Homer <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to think about beer while he rides a bike to work. After a series of severe temptations, Homer crashes his bike as hundreds of bottles of Duff parachuted down on him from a blimp.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E

However, she <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Atwood, T.C. Boyle, and Arthur Phillips, who are better known as realistic contemporary writers.|$|E
500|$|Lane is also {{involved}} in several charities, including Heifer International, which focuses on world hunger, and Artists for Peace and Justice, a Hollywood organization that supports Haiti relief. However, she <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> {{to draw attention to}} her humanitarian efforts: [...] "Sometimes I give with my heart. Sometimes I give financially, but there's something about [...] that I think ought to be anonymous. I don't want it to be a boastful thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Marcas {{appears to}} be destined for greatness; he is {{described}} as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners. His gaze has [...] ("a power"), which he <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included two}} cut scenes from [...] "Dream Team" [...] {{within a week}} of the episode's original release. In one-minute-long clip, Andy continues brown-nosing to Charles; during a documentary interview, Andy says he was not the teacher's pet in school, but that he [...] "walked the teacher's pet, and fed it, and bathed it". A second one-minute clip involves the soccer game itself: Dwight excitedly sets up the game, Jim <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to show Charles he does not know what [...] "offside" [...] means and Creed picks up the ball and hurls it at Kelly.|$|E
500|$|Curteis {{ran into}} several {{problems}} while directing the film. Owing to his absence of feature film experience, the film's tight schedule, and limited funding, he became quickly overwhelmed, and The Projected Man started going over its budget and falling behind on schedule. Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened {{to take over}} production as {{they did not want}} to increase the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that [...] "I think Curteis was relieved to step out because he simply didn't know any longer what to do." [...] Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film; as Gordon said, [...] "one <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to publicize such incidents." ...|$|E

The set for the Geller house was used {{previously}} in [...] "The One Where Joey Moves Out", for Jack's birthday party and in the season seven episode [...] "The One Where Rosita Dies", when Ross and Monica visit their parent's garage. The flashback in Thanksgiving 1987 was Monica and Chandler's first meeting along with Rachel and Chandler. Bright commented that the show <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to contradict itself; [...] "once we establish something, {{we try not to}} undo it." [...] In [...] "The Pilot" [...] it appears Rachel meets Chandler for the first time. She also meets him in a later flashback episode, [...] "The One Where The Stripper Cries". To excuse the continuity error, Bright adds they do not remember each other meeting because they look different.|$|E
500|$|Kanako Sasa, usually {{referred}} to by her surname, is a girl who is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class {{at the beginning of}} Wandering Son. She is sometimes called [...] by her younger brother and Chizuru. She makes her first appearance in chapter two of the manga, but is not named until volume two. She is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone's friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. Sasa acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with Yoshino since pre-school, and later becomes close with Chizuru. Sasa is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school in the morning. She mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".|$|E

500|$|Uematsu enjoys writing lyrical pieces, but <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to be genre-specific. He {{asserts that}} expressing the {{emotions}} he desires {{is more important}} than improving skills: [...] "I {{think it will be a}} shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". The absence of character themes was due to him finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme. The soundtrack features a Latin choral track [...] "Liberi Fatali", which translates to [...] "Fated Children"; its melody forms a musical theme heard in several other pieces in the soundtrack, such as [...] "SeeD" [...] and [...] "The Landing", while the name of [...] "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec" [...] is the recurring lyrics in [...] "Liberi Fatali".|$|E
500|$|Lana made a non-speaking cameo {{appearance}} in the ninth issue of the show's comic book continuation Smallville: Season Eleven, written by executive story editor Bryan Q. Miller. Though Clark and Bart Allen do not notice her, she watches them race over the coast of Cameroon. Lana returns in a parallel storyarc Valkyrie, in which she uses the superhero alias [...] "Angel of the Plateau" [...] and battles terrorists in Africa. Lana also saves Lois from one of their attacks. Lana reveals {{that she has been}} using her abilities to help and protect children from people who would exploit them after Lana had settled in Africa. However, Lois <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to reveal her relationship with Clark to Lana. Elsewhere, the terrorists seek John Corben's aid in defeating Angel of the Plateau. Corben's new kryptonite heart (installed by Winslow Schott) has absorbed the nanites embedded in Lana's skin, rendering her powerless and no longer emitting the kryptonite radiation once more. After Lois helps Lana defeat Corben, Lana reveals that she had seen Lois's engagement ring, thus she already knows about Clark's relationship with Lois. Lana gives her blessing to Lois, and decides to remain in Africa as the Angel.|$|E
500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has always been {{interested}} in creating open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom. They only make games that [...] " [...] love to play" [...] or games that [...] "can bring a smile to people's faces".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} speaks about the protagonist's {{choice between the}} comfort they find in sorrow {{and the idea of}} their {{possible}} happiness. As explained by Lee, it was meant to represent the process of [...] "breaking free" [...] from the continuous periods of feeling trapped in bad life situations and relationships, from which nevertheless, it is hard to leave even when one recognizes the negativity that comes along with them. In order to delve into the aforementioned inner conflict, Lee uses the concept of addiction as a medium. The word [...] "lithium" [...] is continuously repeated throughout the song in a metaphorical sense, as the protagonist describes her love–hate relationship with sorrow. A writer of Billboard saw [...] "Lithium" [...] as a lyrical continuation of the theme explored in the band's previous single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; while in the former Lee determinedly broke up with her lover, in the latter [...] " [...] mourns his departure as she <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to wallow in despair that's so familiar, it's almost a friend". [...] Similarly, a writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan, with the latter song exploring his [...] "apparently pathetic" [...] perspective of the story touched upon by Lee in the former one.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} eighth best episode of The Simpsons by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] represent The Simpsons [...] "at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out the good stuff with surprising accuracy and skill." [...] Gibron added that the episode shows that the made-up romance between Mrs. Krabappel and Woodrow [...] "works because it's so painfully true. [...] How the kiss-off to Mrs. Krabappel is created and handled shows that The Simpsons has heart to add to its humor." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating. He thought the intertwining of the two plots in the episode [...] "works very well, creating a fast paced story. Bart's alias, Woodrow, is a delight to hear in voice-overs and Homer's antics produce many laughs." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] stands out as a [...] "very strong episode" [...] because it [...] "steers clear of most potentially sappy material and offers a lively piece. [...] The 'B' story in which Homer <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to swear also swings and creates some great moments." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said they [...] "loved" [...] Homer's suggestion for the [...] letter from Woodrow: [...] "Dear Baby. Welcome to Dumpsville, population: you. P.S. I am gay." [...] In 2000, {{the staff of the}} Star Tribune listed their top ten episodes. [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] was listed at number four.|$|E
