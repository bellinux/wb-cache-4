30|$|In conclusion, we have {{presented}} the novel 4 -arylidene pyrazole derivatives bearing benzenesulfonamide moiety as potential antimicrobial agents. The reported compounds were conveniently prepared by Knovenagel condensation of 4 -formyl pyrazoles with pyrazolones. Some of the <b>tested</b> <b>compounds</b> displayed excellent antibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and S. aureus). For instance, compounds 4 a and 5 a {{were found to}} be more effective than the reference drug ciprofloxacin. However, against Gram-negative bacteria (P. fluorescens and E. coli), the level of activity shown by the <b>tested</b> <b>compounds</b> was found to be significantly low as only 2 of the 14 <b>tested</b> <b>compounds</b> displayed activities comparable to the reference drug against P. fluorescens, while none of the compounds {{were found to be}} highly effective against E. coli. All the <b>tested</b> <b>compounds</b> showed moderate antifungal activity against C. albicans, while two compounds showed activity better than the reference drug against S. cerevisiae.

50|$|For {{assaying}} suspected estrogen active substances, a {{range of}} concentrations of the <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> {{is added to the}} experimental medium. In each experiment, the cells are exposed to a dilution series of 17β-estradiol (0.1 pM-1000 pM) for providing a positive control (standard dose-response curve), and treated only with hormone-free medium as a negative control. The bioassay ends on day 6 (late exponential phase) by removing the media from the wells and fixing the cells with trichloroacetic acid. After incubation (30 min; 4 °C) the trichloroacetic acid is removed by washing the plates under a gentle stream of cold water. After drying the plates at 40 °C the cell protein is stained with sulforhodamine B (SRB). After incubation (10 min) the dye is washed off with aqueous acetic acid (1%) and the plates are dried again at 40 °C. Finally, bound dye is solubilized with tris-buffer and incubated (20 min; 4 °C) and the absorbance is read at 492 nm.|$|E

5000|$|To {{calculate}} phenol coefficient, {{the concentration}} of phenol at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by {{the concentration of}} the <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> that kills the organism under the same conditions (or, probably more common, dividing the dilution factor at which the tested substance shows activity by the dilution factor at which phenol shows comparable activity). The Rideal-Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as [...] "...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution". [...] Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic {{the conditions in which}} many disinfectants were used. The Chick-Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions in which modern disinfectants are used.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{availability}} of several assays to evaluate {{the activity of the}} microbial enzymes in vitro and in vivo, their use has been limited to just a handful of reports. Most pertinent question is why these methods are not adopted widely? In vitro and in vivo assays although available in plenty, not a single assay completely resembles the pathophysiology of thrombosis in humans. Therefore, it is best that a combination of several assays are to be used to evaluate any new compound of microbial origin, for a clear clinical relevance and pharmacological effectiveness. Albeit the bottlenecks, these assays could be yet another step closer to studying thrombosis and thereby providing a holistic approach in tackling this disease in humans. The specificity of the <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> towards a target molecule (in the blood) is an important factor that needs to be considered. This could be addressed by carrying out kinetic assays in combination with the other assays as discussed in the review. Global in vitro assays such as CloFAL and TEG when performed together, {{in the presence of the}} <b>test</b> <b>compound,</b> could give a complete picture on the net haemostatic balance, time taken for the clot formation to occur, integrity of the clot formed and also the level of functioning of platelets. Furthermore, if the <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> shows satisfactory results, it could be applied to any one of the in vivo animal models described in the review. Doing so would help in a better understanding of the role of <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> in alleviating pathophysiology of the disease and would help in determining whether the candidate drug has scientific merit to justify further development. It would also provide information on the mechanism of action of the <b>test</b> <b>compound,</b> as to whether it is a fibrinolytic- or thrombolytic-based compound. Based on the results obtained from these assays, <b>test</b> <b>compound</b> exhibiting a desired pharmacological effect should be subjected to clinical trials involving human volunteers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSkin {{absorption}} {{testing in}} vitro is a regulatory accepted alternative method (OECD Guideline 428).
