25|$|Recreational use of {{tianeptine}} is {{rare and}} <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> only {{been seen in}} persons already using multiple substances for recreational purposes. 141 cases of recreational use were identified in France between 1989 and 2004, correlating to an incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 1000 persons treated with tianeptine and 45 between 2006 and 2011. The main reason for recreational use is to achieve an anxiolytic effect. According to Servier, cessation of treatment with tianeptine is difficult, due {{to the possibility of}} withdrawal symptoms in a person. The severity of the withdrawal is dependent on the daily dose, with high doses being extremely difficult to quit.|$|E

25|$|Known as the fraternal {{birth order}} (FBO) effect, this {{theory has been}} backed up by strong {{evidence}} of its prenatal origin, although no evidence <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> linked it to an exact prenatal mechanism. However, research suggests {{that this may be}} of immunological origin, caused by a maternal immune reaction against a substance crucial to male fetal development during pregnancy, which becomes increasingly likely after every male gestation. As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur. This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, causing the exposed son to be more attracted to men over women.|$|E
25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} cue cards. Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, and a picture of a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. Additional research is needed to replicate the results of the limited studies that have been conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the canal}} {{approached}} Hancock, more construction problems surfaced. Limestone sinkholes and caverns caused the canal bottom to cave in near Shepherdstown, near Two Locks above Dam No. 4, around Four Locks, Big pool, and Roundtop Hill near Dam No. 6. On 6 December 1839, Chief Engineer Fisk wrote, [...] "These breaks have all evidently been occasioned by limestone sinks which exhibit themselves by a falling {{down of the}} bottom of the Canal into limestone caverns that are lower than, and extend out under the bed of the river: — in consequence of which the water from the Canal is at first conducted down below the canal bottom perhaps twenty or thirty feet and thence out along under the bed of the river ... It has been a matter of surprise to me that our Canal <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> suffered so little from limesinks. We may yet however have much trouble from this source near and above the breach at Lock No. 37. For about a mile, there is scarcely a hundred feet in length of the canal in which there are not several small lime sink holes...".

2500|$|Paparizou {{made the}} first {{announcement}} of the new album {{in an interview with}} Down Town Magazine in October 2009; at that time three of the tracks on the album had been completed. She stated that she and her team had gathered a lot of material and that she was [...] "very pleased" [...] with the outcome thus far, announcing two of the collaborators: singer-songwriter Giorgos Sabanis and lyricist Giannis Doxas, who is also Paparizou's A; both musicians were on the previous album. Doxas <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> been confirmed as the lyricist of the tracks [...] "Girna Me Sto Htes" [...] (Bring me back to yesterday) and [...] "Thalassa" [...] (Sea), while Sabanis is thus far the composer of all four confirmed tracks. Like the previous album, it was recorded partially in Sweden, where she spent her winter holidays, and also at her professional home studio in Glyfada, Athens. As she had first done on Vrisko To Logo Na Zo, Paparizou contributed musically to the album, having reportedly written the music to one of the songs. Paparizou's fiancé and manager Toni Mavridis composed tracks for the album, as he has done for all of her solo albums, while Dimitris Kontopoulos' inclusion was described as a [...] "surprise," [...] being the first time he has worked with Paparizou since her debut album. Lyricists on the album include Niki Papatheohari who wrote the lyrics to the lead single [...] "An Isouna Agapi", Eleanna Vrahali who had written the lyrics to [...] "Porta Gia Ton Ourano" [...] on the previous album, and Valia Kalantzi. Although Paparizou previously recorded [...] "Papeles Mojados" [...] (wet papers) with Spanish flamenco-electronic group Chambao for her fourth album, that track was re-recorded with vocals from Paparizou rather than an actual collaboration between the two artists, making [...] "Thalassa" [...] her first collaboration to be featured on an album during her solo career and second collaboration overall after [...] "I Zileia Monaxia", a cover of [...] "L'envie d'aimer" [...] with TV presenter Nikos Aliagas, released on his album project Rendez-Vous (2007).
