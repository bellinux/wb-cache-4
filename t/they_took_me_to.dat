500|$|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is {{the first}} English {{language}} film and the first big studio production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, {{up to this point}} best known for his 2009 Nazi zombie-themed, independent horror comedy film Dead Snow. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kravitz began {{banging on}} {{pots and pans}} in the kitchen, playing them as drums {{at the age of}} three. At the age of five, {{he wanted to be a}} musician. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. Kravitz grew up {{listening}} to the music his parents listened to: R, jazz, classical, opera, gospel, and blues. [...] "My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a lot of shows," [...] Kravitz said. Around the age of seven, he saw The Jackson 5 perform at Madison Square Garden, which became his favorite group. His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, Miles Davis and other jazz greats. Ellington even played [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] for him one year when he was about 5. He was exposed to the soul music of Motown, Stax, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Gladys Knight, The Isley Brothers, and Gamble and Huff growing up who were key influences on his musical style. Kravitz often went to see New York theater, where his mother worked. His mother encouraged his dreams of pursuing music.|$|E
6000|$|VIVIE. Wait a bit. That wasn't the beginning. I {{went up to}} town on an {{invitation}} from some artistic people in Fitzjohn's Avenue: {{one of the girls}} was a Newnham chum. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the National Gallery-- ...|$|E
3000|$|... (…) My mother {{migrated}} {{from the mountains}} [to the city]. She had no healthcare, no insurance, no nothing (...). [Later,] I helped my own daughters <b>to</b> migrate (...). Now, <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Belgium {{to be taken care}} of… That’s how they found out I have an awful bacteria that could kill me (…). My daughter also took [my grand-daughter] Clarita to Belgium. She had cancer and got cured. (Mariana, 70, mother of MDW 2, residing in Lima).|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} better. If <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the prison, I {{will never see}} him again. His eyes would kill me. Do you ever watch him and see the pride that there is in his eye? He has never yet known what disgrace means; and now I, his mother, have brought him to this!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> the {{courtyard}} unresisting, where the prison van {{was standing in}} waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{consequence}} of these conjoint invitations, I {{spent a week}} with Mr. C. and Mr. W. at Allfoxden house, and during this time, (beside the reading of MS. poems) <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Linmouth, and Linton, and the Valley of Stones....|$|E
60|$|The Sagoths {{scratched}} their heads. This {{was a new}} one on them, and so being stupid brutes <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{their masters}} whom they felt would be better fitted to solve the riddle of my return, for riddle they still considered it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} have not to me. Poor Mabel! Then <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Custins. That was worst of all. I cannot quite tell you what {{happened}} there." [...] Of course he asked her,--but, as she had said, she could not quite tell him about Lord Popplecourt.|$|E
60|$|I was puzzled. I {{had only}} just been {{released}} from the dungeons, and was lying pain-racked in my customary cell, when <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> the dungeon.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> {{and tied}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a butcher post.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said she, [...] "the saints in Heaven cannot help <b>me</b> {{now until}} <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my rest. There {{is no place}} for me in the world beyond, and all my friends were slain on the day I was <b>taken.</b> Leave <b>me,</b> brave men, and let me care for myself. Already it lightens in the east, and black will be your fate if you are taken. Go, and may the blessing of one who was once a holy nun go with you and guard you from danger!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the pits, where I lay {{carefully}} guarded. I {{was sure}} that I was {{to be taken to}} the vivi-section laboratory, and it required all my courage to fortify myself against the terrors of so fearful a death. In Pellucidar, where there is no time, death-agonies may endure for eternities.|$|E
60|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. Ha, ha! Yes: <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{the circus}} when I was a child. It {{was my first}} moment of happiness, my first glimpse of heaven. I ran away and joined the troupe. They caught me and dragged {{me back to my}} gilded cage; but I had tasted freedom; and they never could make me forget it.|$|E
6000|$|The three gentlemen {{burst into}} a loud laugh, said I was a [...] "rum chap"--a [...] "downy cove," [...] and made other remarks which I could not {{understand}} then; but the meaning of which I have since comprehended, for <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a great rascal, I am sorry to say, and supposed that I had robbed the I. W. D. Association, and, {{in order to make}} my money secure, settled it on my wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I like my nice Captain. And I {{like the}} waiters. <b>They</b> would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Crystal Palace--only they're always busy. I {{wish it was}} bedtime; I don't {{know what to do}} with myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They can <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> no place," [...] she said, gently, [...] "which I shall {{think of}} as I think of {{the place where you}} found <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> can <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> no dearer friend than the friend who saved my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One night I was whisked off to London at a moment's notice. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> {{the house}} in Soho. Once I got away from the {{sanatorium}} I felt different--as though something in me that had been buried {{for a long time}} was waking up again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} is still with the Indians. A French soldier came along one day and carried me off in a canoe. He wanted to marry me, but I told him I was already married and then he set me ashore in the wilderness. I tramped for miles and miles, until I was so weary I could {{scarcely}} stand and I was almost dying of starvation, when I fell in with some German settlers. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Fort Stanwix and from there I was taken to Albany, and finally {{made my way to}} Philadelphia, and then came on here. Uriah and I met at Winchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{all turned}} out well. It was a pitch dark night, raining and blowing, and the sentries kept inside their boxes. I {{got up to}} the top of the wall all right, and was able to fasten the rope on to the spikes and slide down on the other side. The woman was there with a man, whom she told me was her brother. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a creek two miles away and there put me on board a boat, and I was rowed out to a {{smuggling}} craft which at once set sail, and two days later was landed at Cherbourg. So that's how I came to learn English." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a canoe, {{and we were}} paddled {{across the}} lake by Tlascalans, till at length {{we came to the}} Spanish camp. All the journey through, my guards, though they laid no hand on me, fearing the anger of Cortes, mocked and taunted me, asking me how I liked the ways of the heathen, and whether I ate the flesh of the sacrifices raw or cooked; and many another such brutal jest they made at my expense. For a while I bore it, for I had learned to be patient from the Indians, but at last I {{answered}} them in few words and bitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But that I rode hard," [...] I laughed, [...] "it {{is likely}} <b>they</b> had <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Toulouse, were I might have lost my head before my friends {{could have found}} and claimed me. I hope you'll see it is too comely a head to be so lightly parted with." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{lowered their}} rifles and {{advanced}} pleasantly toward me placing their right hands upon my left shoulder, after {{the manner of}} their custom of salute, and asking me many questions about myself and my wanderings. <b>They</b> then <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the house {{of one of them}} which was only a short distance away.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> Dunedin Jail, {{and clapped}} {{me into the}} old cell. The only {{difference}} they made was, that I had no work to do and was well fed. I stood this {{for a week or}} two, until one day the governor was making his rounds, and I put the matter to him.|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} I doubt that I weighed an ounce over ninety pounds. Yet, two years before, {{when the doors}} of San Quentin first closed on me, I had weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds. It seems {{incredible}} {{that there was another}} ounce I could part with and still live. Yet in the months that followed, ounce by ounce I was reduced until I know I must have weighed nearer eighty than ninety pounds. I do know, after I managed my escape from solitary and struck the guard Thurston on the nose, that before <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> San Rafael for trial, while I was being cleaned and shaved I weighed eighty-nine pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh ay, tried {{all sorts}} o' company. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Greenhill Fair, {{and into a}} great gay jerry-go-nimble show, where there were women-folk riding round--standing upon horses, with hardly {{anything}} on but their smocks; but it didn't cure me a morsel. And then I was put errand-man at the Women's Skittle Alley {{at the back of}} the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge. 'Twas a horrible sinful situation, and a very curious place for a good man. I had to stand and look ba'dy people in the face from morning till night; but 'twas no use--I was just as bad as ever after all. Blushes hev been in the family for generations. There, 'tis a happy providence that I be no worse." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} tired horse to a canter, Bes riding {{ahead of me}} to clear a road through the crowded street in which, at this hour of sundown, all the idlers of Memphis seemed to have gathered. They stared at me {{because it was not}} common to see men riding in Memphis, and with little love, since from my dress and escort <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be some envoy from their hated master, the Great King of the East. Some even {{threatened}} to bar the way; but we thrust through and presently turned into a thoroughfare of private houses standing in their own gardens. Ours was the third of these. At its gate I leapt from my horse, pushed open the closed door and hastened in to seek and learn.|$|E
2500|$|A man landed near my {{subterranean}} home. Behind {{him another}} man landed {{to his right}} [...] Then a third [...] landed nearby. The three sat over something {{that appeared to be}} a cloud. They spoke <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They told me they came from far away, that they were coming for <b>me,</b> and <b>they</b> would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> an old ancient regime.|$|R
40|$|When I {{close my}} eyes and listen to music, images come <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>   And <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a place where I feel open in a way I never felt before,” said Rick, dying from lung cancer at the age of 59. I never {{suggested}} or encouraged Rick to use imagery while listening to music, yet it seemed to come to him naturally and spontaneously.   During the course of music therapy that lasted nearly a year, Rick, who had kept his feelings inside throughout his life became a man whose heart was open to sharing his feelings.   To witness his transformation was humbling and mystifying at the same time. I thought to myself: How did music and imagery transform Rick? The answer came while attending The Bonny Method of Guided Imagery & Music (GIM) Level I training. During the four intense days filled with powerful imagery, vivid dreams, and new insights, I began to understand the power of music and imagery Rick experienced.

60|$|The next stage, however, ended as {{that one}} ended; {{we had no}} new clue. There was a spacious inn here, solitary, but a {{comfortable}} substantial building, and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it, where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the carriage-door, entreating <b>me</b> <b>to</b> alight and refresh myself while the horses were making ready, I {{thought it would be}} uncharitable <b>to</b> refuse. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> upstairs <b>to</b> a warm room and left me there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{left her}} in a few weeks," [...] Adam went on. [...] "Alvarez was putting up for {{president}} and my savings were at stake. Hattie went home to Virginia while I helped Alvarez on the coast. He was hard up against it, though he's been president three times since. Well, when things looked blackest, I was knocked out in Salinas swamps, by fever and a bullet that touched my lungs. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the old Indian mission--we were {{cut off from the}} ship--and Father Herman put the rurales off my track. I've sent him wine and candles, he's at the mission yet; it stands between thick forest and swamps like this, and the padre's the only white man who has lived there long. Get down the chart and I'll show you the landing place." ...|$|E
60|$|One morning I saw a ship passing not far off; {{and making}} a signal with the mast of the boat that had been washed ashore with me I {{attracted}} their attention. I {{saw that she was}} a Spaniard, but I could not help that, for I {{had no choice but to}} hail her. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Porto Rico and there reported me as a shipwrecked sailor they had picked up. The governor questioned me closely as to what vessel I had been lost from, and although I made up a good story he had his doubts. Fortunately it did not enter his mind that I was not a Spaniard; but he said he believed I was some bad character who had been marooned by my comrades for murder or some other crime, and so put me in prison until he could learn something that would verify my story.|$|E
60|$|This was the {{substance}} of their talk; that for the reasons I have already mentioned {{it would be best}} that I should die at once. Sentence, said the commandant, had been passed, and could not be rescinded, since even if it were, their offence would remain as heavy {{in the eyes of the}} English authorities. But if <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> their main camp to be re-tried by their great council, possibly that sentence might be rescinded and they be left individually and collectively to atone for what they had done. Also they knew that I was very clever and might escape in some other way to bring the English, or possibly the Zulus, upon them, since they felt convinced that Dingaan and I were working together for their destruction, and that while I had breath in my body I should never cease my efforts to be avenged.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years {{trying to get their}} film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of a}} year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He showed me a letter from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood and <b>they</b> have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman thing. He could see Hollywood for what it was." ...|$|R
40|$|It was at {{half past}} {{ten in the}} morning that <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> the {{operating}} room, weary with pain and numb with morphine. Upon my closed eyes I felt, for an instant, the soft, cool touch of the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s hand, succeeded immediately after by the warmth and woolliness of gauze and by {{the pressure of the}} rubber hood over my nose and chin. I wriggled a moment, coughed, and the pressure vanished. When it came again it brought with it the pungent sweetness of ether. I breathed deep, gasped and breathed deeper, gasped again and pumped for breath, my mouth open and my ears ringing...|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} {{of writing and}} filmmaking have given me tremendous joy and fulfillment. They have opened doors. <b>They</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lands and places I would never have gone. In 2010, Johnson won a writing fellowship to Brown University in the US, where he {{did most of the}} writing of his first novel, Deeper into the Night. Brown provided a most conducive atmosphere and workspace. It was also an opportunity to meet great writers he had read but never dreamt of ever setting eyes on - George Lamming, Chinua Achebe, John Edgar Wideman, Ama Ata Aidoo and the indefatigable writer and director of the INP, Robert Couver.|$|R
