50|$|S-Bahn {{vehicles}} in Berlin were allocated numbers from 2051 for driving coaches and 5051 for <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... the MBTA owned 481 coaches. Of these, 420 were {{in active}} service and 61 {{inactive}} for various reasons. Coaches whose designations start with BTC (Blind <b>Trailer</b> <b>Coach)</b> are conventional coaches, while those starting with CTC (Control <b>Trailer</b> <b>Coach)</b> are cab cars. Cab cars will occasionally also {{appear in the}} middle of a consist. Coaches acquired before 1990 were single-level cars with 88 to 127 seats; those since are bilevel cars with 173 to 185 seats.|$|R
50|$|A centre <b>trailer</b> <b>coach,</b> with no driving cab. The centre car had {{a number}} of first class compartments, in {{addition}} to third class accommodation.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{remaining}} units, the <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> in each unit has a recess in its roof where a pantograph could be fitted, {{to allow for}} future conversion to overhead AC power.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} {{multiple units}} {{consisted of three}} driving motor coaches and six driving <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches.</b> Since the DM cars had a cab at each end, this allowed trains of one, two, or three cars to be formed.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{has built}} several coaches to {{accommodate}} wheelchair users, starting with driving <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> 105 (heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named Marjorie) followed by 601 Elsie, then 602 Winn and 603 May.|$|R
25|$|In 1921 it {{had been}} {{considered}} desirable to augment train lengths at the busy periods, and four new <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> to the original specification were built at Eastleigh; 24 five-car trains were run per hour at the busiest times.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were also fitted for push-pull working, being coupled to a driving <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> that contained a driver's cab {{and allowed the}} train to be driven in reverse, without running the locomotive around the train at the terminus.|$|R
50|$|Two {{parts of}} the set were then sold and kept at Steamport, Southport. Meanwhile, the Driving <b>Trailer</b> <b>coach</b> (DTS) was kept at the Wirral Transport Museum. The two {{parts of the}} unit, which were sold, have been owned by the Suburban Electric Railway Association since {{purchase}} by its forerunner, the Mersey and Tyneside Electric Preservationists in 1996, and are stored at the Electric Railway Museum on the outskirts of Coventry. After transport of the Driving <b>Trailer</b> <b>coach</b> from Birkenhead, the entire unit was correctly reformed at the Coventry museum in October 2010, {{for the first time in}} over 20 years. The Driving Motor coach (DMBS) interior is open to the public during museum open days.|$|R
50|$|On {{display is}} a {{restored}} Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad dome car, The Silver Horizon (car #375). The dome car {{served as the}} station office, but proved unsuitable. It has since {{been replaced by the}} former Tucson, Arizona station building, a double-wide modular <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> train.|$|R
5000|$|... 63 coaches (21 {{trains in}} three-car formation) were {{manufactured}} in 1990 and entered service in 1991. The types of coaches were the KuRo 253 (Green Car driving trailer), MoHa 253 (trailer) and KuMoHa 252 (driving <b>trailer)</b> <b>coaches.</b> Three-car sets were sometimes joined {{together to form}} six-car formations.|$|R
50|$|For {{stopping}} trains (including the Alton line), 38 two-car units designated 2-BIL were produced; {{these had}} side corridors and lavatories, but no corridor {{connection between the}} coaches. They had one control <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> and one motor coach equipped with two 275 hp (205 kW) motors and Metrovick control equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Esslingen railbus, {{sometimes}} shortened in German to Esslinger, {{had been}} developed during the 1950s by the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen for small branch lines and private railways. Fifty examples were built in three variants: power coaches (Triebwagen) or VT, <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> (Beiwagen) or VB and driving coaches (Steuerwagen) or VS.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{the modern}} RV {{industry}} had its beginnings {{in the late}} 1920s and 1930s (shortly after {{the advent of the}} automobile industry), where a number of companies began manufacturing house <b>trailers</b> or <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches,</b> as they were then called. Often, these started out as mom and pop operations, building their units in garages or back yards. (One of these early manufacturers, Airstream, is still in business today.) Though tied to the mobile home industry in the early years—when few units were longer than 9 m long, and thus easily transportable—the 1950s saw a separation of the two, as (what are now referred to as) mobile homes became larger and more immobile, and thus largely became an entirely separate industry. During the 1950s, in addition to travel <b>trailers</b> or <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches,</b> manufacturers began building self-contained motorhomes.|$|R
5000|$|Iris 320 is a {{modified}} TGV train operated by SNCF International as a dedicated track recording train for high-speed railways. [...] The train can run at 320 kilometres-per-hour {{and consists of}} two power cars and eight <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches,</b> providing a 160-metre long laboratory. It was converted from former SNCF TGV Réseau passenger train number 4530.|$|R
50|$|The {{rail gauge}} {{is the same}} as that of the Linz tramway, , the line is electrified, {{operating}} at 600 V C. It ran regular services from 2 September 1913 to the end of 1973. From 1929 it was connected directly to the Linz tramway network at Ebelsberg, so that <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> could run through from Linz to St. Florian.|$|R
5000|$|Although once electrified, {{train service}} is {{currently}} provided by two diesel trains, running on [...] narrow gauge track. Each train {{consists of a}} diesel-hydraulic locomotive at the southern end, five <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> and at the northern end, a driver control unit with passenger space. One train is named Sir John Betjeman, and the other Sir William Heygate.|$|R
50|$|The body of no. 3170 {{was used}} as a holiday home near Kirbymoorside in North Yorkshire for 70 years and was bought by a railway enthusiast in 2003. A trust was formed to restore the vehicle and a <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> to form an Edwardian {{multiple}} unit that will be twice as old as most of the (ex-BR) DMUs on other heritage railways.|$|R
50|$|Two train {{compositions}} {{are usually}} coupled together {{to travel to}} Zweilütschinen where they are then split. The front portion travels to Lauterbrunnen, the other one to Grindelwald. The motor coach (power unit) is always positioned on the uphill side, a driving <b>trailer</b> (<b>coach</b> with a driver’s cab) being positioned on the downhill side, to avoid any running round manoeuvres at the terminus stations.|$|R
50|$|Yet another {{system was}} used from 1956. With this one {{the first group}} of numbers gave the motor power divided by 100, the second group the top speed/10 and the third group the 2- or 3-digit serial number. <b>Trailer</b> <b>coaches,</b> driving coaches and centre coaches were {{designated}} with the letters VB, VS and VM. Examples are Classes VT 2.09 and VT 18.16.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, the DRG renumbered these vehicles, {{resulting}} in every four-digit operating number only being available once. Catenary railbuses were allocated {{the range of}} numbers from 1000 to 1999 and their associated trailer cars were given numbers from 2001. Power coaches on the Berlin S-Bahn were numbered from 3001 onwards; their driving coaches were given numbers starting at 5001 and the <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> at 6001.|$|R
50|$|Currently two {{vehicles}} {{have been}} preserved. The two carriages {{used by the}} MOD were put up for disposal in early 2006. The driving trailer, no. 75186, was saved for preservation and has moved to the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire. It was joined by driving motor no. 61183 in October 2006, and {{it was hoped that}} the centre <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> would also eventually be preserved, but was scrapped in 2006.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> were {{originally}} fitted with Gresley bogies which were replaced on Driving Trailer (DT) and Trailer Standard Open (TSO) which was formerly Composite Trailer and B5 Bogies on Battery Driving Trailer which became Battery Composite Trailer, the refurbishment moved First class accommodation {{to a position}} over the Westinghouse CM38 main compressor which was noisy and caused vibration. The Motor Coach retained its Gresley derived bogies after refurbishment.|$|R

Requires {{deposit of}} {{surcharge}} revenue {{in a new}} trust fund and requires that trust funds be used solely to operate, maintain and repair state parks and to protect wildlife and natural resources. Exempts commercial vehicles, <b>trailers</b> and <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches</b> from the surcharge. Requires annual audit by the State Auditor and review by a citizens oversight committee...|$|R
50|$|In 1924 the {{electric}} railbuses in the railway divisions of Altona, Breslau and Munich were initially given the numbers starting at 501 for driving coaches and 5001 for <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches.</b> In addition {{they were given}} {{the name of their}} home division. Because every Reichsbahn division therefore had numbers beginning with 501, there were many cases of several vehicles with the same number which could only be distinguished by their divisional name. Subsequently new procurements for other divisions were also incorporated into this system.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} these were in 1931, for the Buenos Aires Midland Railway. The railway was already using Sentinel railcars similar to the LNER pattern, but {{required}} a larger multiple unit. Two were built as four-unit rakes: a locomotive based on the previous railcar chassis and three <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches.</b> The B-B locomotive used two four wheel bogies, each driven by a six-cylinder motor based on the railcar, {{for a total of}} 250 bhp. The boiler was relatively high pressure, although typical for Sentinel, using a Woolnough water-tube boiler of 300 psi.|$|R
5000|$|The Class 5M2s {{operate on}} the [...] track that is {{standard}} throughout Southern Africa. The motor coaches draw 3,000 volt direct current from an overhead pantograph; they have a power output of [...] and produce 158 kN of tractive effort. The maximum speed of a 5M2 trainset is 100 km/h. A motor coach can carry 56 seated and 110 standing passengers, and has a tare weight of 60 tonnes. A <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> can carry 52 seated and 149 standing passengers, and has a tare weight of 30.5 t.|$|R
50|$|Unabashed, the GWR now {{suggested}} that their new railmotors {{would be useful}} on the line; specially developed to reduce costs on lightly trafficked lines, these consisted of a passenger coach with a small steam engine incorporated at one end. The railmotors could haul one or two goods wagons or a <b>trailer</b> <b>coach.</b> The Board considered this to be an attractive idea, and applied to the Board of Trade on 3 May 1904 for sanction to operate them. This was necessary because the axle load of the railmotors, at 12 tons, exceeded the authorised rolling stock weights.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1971 all the Class 505 Altrincham Electric {{units were}} {{withdrawn}} when {{the line was}} converted from 1,500 V DC to [...] Two centre trailer cars, M29666 and M29670 (MSJAR 117 and 121), were purchased by the Altrincham Electric Railway Preservation Society {{and moved to the}} Yorkshire Dales Railway (now Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway). In 1983 they were moved to the Midland Railway Centre (now Midland Railway - Butterley) in Derbyshire where they are undergoing restoration. Here they joined centre <b>trailer</b> <b>coach</b> M29663 (MSJAR 114) which had been bought by Derby City Council. This coach was broken up in 2006. No driving coaches have been preserved.|$|R
50|$|At {{some larger}} lay-bys mobile {{catering}} {{is provided by}} vendors operating from converted caravans, <b>trailers,</b> or <b>coaches.</b> These facilities generally offer much better value for money than roadside restaurants and therefore tend to be popular with truckers.|$|R
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as <b>trailer</b> <b>coaches.</b> Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|R
