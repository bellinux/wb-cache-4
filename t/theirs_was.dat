Nevertheless, Goronwy ap Heilin had committed himself to the struggle and died in rebellion, alongside the disinherited princes who stood with Dafydd ap Gruffudd in the last springtime of the principality of Wales, diehards who knew that <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> not the heroism of a new beginning but the ultimate stand of the very last cohort clutching the figment of the political order that they had once been privileged to know.|$|E
25|$|Li and Giger first lived {{together}} in squalor, often in condemned buildings.

But Li suffered from emotional insecurity, heavy drug-dependence and physical exhaustion from theatrical tours. She committed suicide (by gunshot) at age 27 {{as a result}} of constant depression. Some claimed that she was affected by the morbid atmosphere of Giger's works. According to Giger, she had wished her life to be short and intense.|$|E

He was afterwards seen as a leading member of the Bessarabian expatriate community. According to fellow Bessarabian exile Axinte Frunză, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> a minuscule political lobby, with only 6 to 10 active members, all of them saddened by the small-mindedness of Romanian society.|$|E

25|$|In 1794, Jackson {{formed a}} {{business}} with fellow lawyer and planter John Overton, overtly {{buying and selling}} land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> a frank avowal; they, like many of their contemporaries, would deal with lands within Indian territory. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened to claim by North Carolinians all of the Indian lands in that state's transmontane west.

Pollitt's parents were socialists and freethinkers {{and it was his}} mother, a member of the Independent Labour Party, who provided the youngster with his first induction into the principles and local networks of socialism. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> an especially close relationship and Pollitt found in his mother both a confidante and a model of working-class dignity in the face of affliction.|$|E

25|$|During {{a meeting}} with the Soviet Embassy staff, PCR leader Ana Pauker {{mentioned}} that Communists were especially concerned about events related to the petroleum industry in Romania (centered on Prahova County), which was by then becoming much less lucrative. Tudor Ionescu, the PSD's Minister of Mines and Petroleum, supported the initiative of American and British businessmen to withdraw their investments, but was virulently opposed by the PCR, who argued that <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> a move to undermine support for the BPD government, by leaving thousands of people unemployed. Pauker also alleged that a similar move was to be carried out by Ford's Bucharest branch. Kavtaradze noted dissatisfaction among workers, civil servants, and Romanian Army personnel over their low incomes.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, Harlan married Malvina French Shanklin, the {{daughter}} of an Indiana businessman. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> a happy marriage, which lasted until Harlan's death.

Their second son, James S. Harlan, practiced in Chicago and served as attorney general of Puerto Rico before being appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906 and becoming that body's chairman in 1914. Their youngest son, John Maynard, also practiced in Chicago and served as an alderman before running unsuccessfully for mayor in both 1897 and 1905; John Maynard's son, John Marshall Harlan II, served as a Supreme Court Associate Justice from 1955 until 1971.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of Hephaestion's {{personal}} relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages. Apart from Diogenes of Sinope's alleged letter quoted below, heavily hinting at Alexander's yielding to Hephaestion's thighs, ancient sources do not generally mention that Hephaestion and Alexander may have been lovers, as some modern scholars have theorized. Overall direct evidence is non-existent and, {{at least according to}} Thomas R. Martin, this was a practice which was uncommon by majority Greek standards of their time.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{criticism}} and a lawsuit that alleged that <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> {{not the best}} proposal, Flatiron Constructors, Inc. and Manson Construction Company were awarded the contract on September 19, 2007; Flatiron's was the highest-priced and longest schedule of the bids submitted. The lead designer was Figg Engineering, with Ayres Associates providing hydraulic and scour analyses. TKDA of Saint Paul was the engineer of record for the approach highways, second street bridges, retaining walls, lighting, and water resource engineering services on the project. While the total cost {{was expected to be}} between USD $300 million and $350 million for the 1,900-foot (579m) multi-span bridge, including financial incentives for accelerating the schedule, the winning bid was for USD $234 million. Disincentives for missing the completion date of December 24, 2008 included a $200,000 per day penalty, while incentives to finish early could have been as much as $27 million.|$|E
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced {{out into the open}} by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason to be angry at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E
25|$|Stalin's {{second wife}} was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> {{not an easy}} relationship, and they often rowed. They had two {{biological}} children—a son, Vasiliy, and a daughter, Svetlana—and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921. During his marriage to Nadezhda, Stalin had affairs with many other women, {{most of whom were}} fellow revolutionaries or their wives. Nadezdha suspected that this was the case, and committed suicide in 1932. Stalin regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle. Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood, and was also very fond of Artyom. In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her. After the Second World War he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life. After Stalin's death, Svetlana defected to the U.S.|$|E
