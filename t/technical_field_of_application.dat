40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a new process for taking layer pictures of a three-dimensional object by means of X-rays. From {{the state of the}} art and the foreseen <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> in particular in the quality assurance of material and component development, the task of the invention is the further development of conventional laminography, i. e. the simplification of the process sequence and the technical layout complying with this at the highest possible quality of the layer pictures. The process according to the invention permits the making of projection data and images and thus the reconstruction of layer pictures of a three-dimensional object (1) by means of a single X-ray source (2) and X-ray detectors (4) arranged opposite the measurement object. In other words, cross-sectional pictures of a measurement object are reconstructed from their X-ray projections. During this operation, the measurement object executes only a translation movement in relation to the X-ray beam field (3) ...|$|R
