2500|$|The {{wings of}} the two {{aircraft}} are similar in design and construction. [...] Both have spans of 18.0m (59ft1in) and are straight tapered with rounded wing tips, although the Air's taper ratio (wing root chord to <b>tip</b> <b>chord)</b> is higher, resulting a slightly greater aspect ratio. Some later Air 100s have squared-off tips terminated in streamlined [...] "salmons". Both wings use the Göttingen 549 airfoil inboard of the tips, though the Air's roots have a thickened version. [...] They are wooden single spar structures, plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The Air 100 has slotted ailerons to improve roll rates and, inboard, has Schempp-Hirth parallel-rule airbrakes mounted immediately aft of the main spar; the Weihe's DFS style brakes had never been very effective, largely because their design placed them further aft on the wing where space did {{not allow them to}} open fully.|$|E

50|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>tip</b> <b>chord</b> to root chord {{is called the}} taper ratio.

40|$|The {{axial spacing}} between the rotor and stator is an {{important}} parameter and has a strong influence {{on the performance of}} axial turbomachines. A study has been carried out to verify the effect of axial spacing on the performance of 1. 35 pressure ratio single stage transonic compressor stage through CFD analysis using commercial code ANSYS FLUENT. Standard k-ε turbulence model with standard wall function is used for analysis. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations are discretized with finite volume approximations using hybrid grids.

50|$|In 1967 {{the model}} 210G {{introduced}} a cantilever wing replacing the strut-braced wing. Its planform {{changed to a}} constant taper from root chord to <b>tip</b> <b>chord.</b> In 1970 the 210K became the first full six-seat model. This was achieved by replacing the flat leaf-springs used for the retractable main landing gear struts (undercarriage) with tapered tubular steel struts of greater length. This allowed the tires to be nested farther {{to the rear of}} the fuselage, making room for the full-size rear seats. In 1979 the 210N model eliminated the folding doors which previously covered the two retracted main wheels. The tubular spring struts retract into shallow channels along the bottom of the fuselage and the wheels fit snugly in closed depressions on the underside of the fuselage. Some models featured de-icing boots as an option.|$|E
50|$|The D-34 {{was a small}} {{single seat}} sailplane, all {{variants}} having a wingspan of only 12.65 m. The first three variants shared a common, single piece, wing of straight tapered plan with a root to <b>tip</b> <b>chord</b> ratio of 2.03 and an area of 8.0 m2. There were small, cigar shaped tip fairings, termed salmons. The profile was the thick (21% thickness to chord ratio) NACA 644621, intended to produce laminar flow over the front 40% of the wing. It was formed around a three box spar of pine and plywood, its cells filled with plastic foam. The spar was less deep than the wing and the surface profile was shaped in ply over {{a small number of}} full chord ribs plus a carefully shaped plastic foam block filling.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{designers}} employed mostly {{planar wing}} designs with simple dihedral after World War II, {{prior to the}} introduction of winglets. With the wide acceptance of winglets in new sailplane designs of the 1990s, designers sought to further optimize the aerodynamic performance of their wingtip designs. Glider winglets were originally retrofitted directly to planar wings, with only a small, nearly right-angle, transition area. Once the performance of the winglet itself was optimized, attention was turned to the transition between the wing and winglet. A common application was tapering the transition area from the wing <b>tip</b> <b>chord</b> to the winglet chord and raking the transition area back, to place the winglet in the optimal position. If the tapered portion was canted upward, the winglet height could also be reduced. Eventually, designers employed multiple non-planar sections, each canting up at a greater angle, dispensing with the winglets entirely.|$|E
40|$|Existing conical-flow {{solutions}} {{have been}} used to calculate the hinge-moment and effectiveness parameters of trailing-edge controls having leading and trailing edges svept ahead of the Mach lines and having streamwise root and <b>tip</b> <b>chords.</b> Equations and detailed charts are presented for the rapid estimation of these parameters. Also included is an approximate method by which these parameters may be corrected for airfoil-section thickness. Deflected controls are assumed to be located either at the wing tip or far enough inboard to prevent the outermost Mach lines from the controls from crossing the wing tip. For either of these locations, the innermost Mach lines are assumed not to cross the wing root chord. The method for determining control hinge moment resulting from wing angle-of-attack loading is valid for wing plan forms having the leading edges swept ahead of the Mach lines and having streamwise tips. The only additional restrictions are that the controls must not be influenced by the tip conical flow from the opposite wing panel or by the inter-action of the wing-root Mach cone with the wing tip...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} leading-edge flaps on three delta double-delta wing planforms having aspect ratios of 1. 75, 2. 11, and 2. 50, {{have been investigated}} experimentally. The wings were mounted on a generic fuselage without an inlet canopy, or a vertical tail. The Mach numbers of the flow over the wings were 1. 60, 1. 90 and 2. 16. A primary set of full-span leading-edge flaps with similar root and <b>tip</b> <b>chords</b> were tested on each wing, and several alternate flap planforms were tested on the aspect ratio 1. 75 wings. It is found that all leading edge geometries were effective in reducing drag lifting over the range of wing aspect ratios and Mach numbers tested. Greater flap performance was obtained when primary flaps were applied to the delta planform. In general, the primary flap geometry yielded better performance than the alternative geometries tested. Flow visualization techniques {{were found to be}} useful for identifying the beneficial effects of leading-edge flap deflection on flow separation as well as fuselage interference effects. Black and white photographs of the delta and double-delta planforms are provided...|$|R
5000|$|The last variant was the D-34 of 1960. Designed, amongst others, by Gerhard Waibel, it {{kept the}} D-34b {{fuselage}} and tail but married it to a wing of new construction methods, different profile and larger area whilst keeping the same span as the earlier models. To achieve the latter both root and <b>tip</b> <b>chords</b> were increased by about 12%. The wings had 1° of dihedral and 2° of forward sweep. The salmons {{were replaced by}} rounded tips and the ailerons were longer and wider {{than those of the}} D-34b; just inboard of them inboard spoilers replaced the flaps. Structurally the wing was very different; there was no main spar. The front 60%, from a light, balsa filled nose to a plywood auxiliary spar, was a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) shell with a stiffening paper honeycomb filling. Ailerons and airbrakes were attached to the auxiliary spar. Behind it, the wing had ribs covered with a GRP/plastic foam sandwich. Careful construction kept the local [...] "waviness" [...] to less than 20 μm in.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation was initiated {{to determine the}} effects of planform curvature (curving the leading and trailing edges of a wing in the X-Y plane) on the transonic flutter characteristics of a series of three moderately swept wing models. Experimental flutter results were obtained in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel for Mach numbers from 0. 60 - 1. 00, with air as the test medium. The models were semispan cantilevered wings with a 3 percent biconvex airfoil and a panel aspect ratio of 1. 14. The baseline model had straight leading and trailing edges (i. e., no planform curvature). The radii of curvature of the leading edges for these two models were 200 and 80 inches. The radii of curvature of the leading edges of the other two models were determined so that the root and <b>tip</b> <b>chords</b> were identical for all three models. Experimental results showed that flutter-speed index and flutter frequency ratio increased as planform curvature increase (radius of curvature of the leading edge was decreased) over the test range of Mach numbers.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the aerodynamic performance of leading-edge flaps on three clipped delta and three clipped double-delta wing planforms with aspect ratios of 1. 75, 2. 11, and 2. 50 was conducted in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers of 1. 60, 1. 90, and 2. 16. A primary set of fullspan leading-edge flaps with similar root and <b>tip</b> <b>chords</b> were investigated on each wing, and several alternate flap planforms were investigated on the aspect-ratio- 1. 75 wings. All leading-edge flap geometries were effective in reducing the drag at lifting conditions over the range of wing aspect ratios and Mach numbers tested. Application of a primary flap resulted in better flap performance with the double-delta planform than with the delta planform. The primary flap geometry generally yielded better performance than the alternate flap geometries tested. Trim drag due to flap-induced pitching moments was found to reduce the leading-edge flap performance more for the delta planform than for the double-delta planform. Flow-visualization techniques showed that leading-edge flap deflection reduces crossflow shock-induced separation effects. Finally, {{it was found that}} modified linear theory consistently predicts only the effects of leading-edge flap deflection as related to pitching moment and lift trends...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a 3 -D, unsteady, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes CFD code {{coupled to}} an {{acoustic}} calculation {{is used to}} predict {{the contribution of the}} exit guide vanes to broadband fan noise. The configuration investigated is that corresponding to the NASA Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) 22 -in fan rig. Then an acoustic model introduced by Nallasamy which is based on 2 -D strip theory is used to compute the broadband rotor-stator interaction noise. One configuration from the SDT matrix is considered here: the fan speed correlating to approach, and outlet guide vane count designed for cut-off of the blade passage frequency. Thus, in the chosen configuration, there are 22 rotor blades and 54 stator blades. The stators are located 2. 5 <b>tip</b> <b>chords</b> downstream of the rotor trailing edge. The RANS computations are used to obtain the spectra of the unsteady surface pressure on the exit guide vanes. This surface pressure is then integrated together with the Green's function for and infinite cylindrical duct to obtain the acoustic field.
