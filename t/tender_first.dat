2500|$|Elongated stigmas, called silks, {{emerge from}} the whorl of husk leaves {{at the end of}} the ear. They are often pale yellow and [...] in length, like tufts of hair in appearance. At the end of each is a carpel, which may develop into a [...] "kernel" [...] if fertilized by a pollen grain. The {{pericarp}} of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as [...] "caryopsis", typical of the grasses, and the entire kernel is often referred to as the [...] "seed". The cob is close to a multiple fruit in structure, except that the individual fruits (the kernels) never fuse into a single mass. The grains are about the size of peas, and adhere in regular rows around a white, pithy substance, which forms the ear. The maximum size of kernels is reputedly [...] An ear commonly holds 600 kernels. They are of various colors: blackish, bluish-gray, purple, green, red, white and yellow. When ground into flour, maize yields more flour with much less bran than wheat does. It lacks the protein gluten of wheat and, therefore, makes baked goods with poor rising capability. A genetic variant that accumulates more sugar and less starch in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called sweet corn. Young ears can be consumed raw, with the cob and silk, but as the plant matures (usually during the summer months), the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility. By the end of the growing season, the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them <b>tender</b> <b>first</b> in boiling water.|$|E
