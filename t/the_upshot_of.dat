25|$|Combinatory {{logic is}} a {{notation}} {{to eliminate the}} need for quantified variables in mathematical logic. It was introduced by Moses Schönfinkel In the latter 1930s, Alonzo Church and his students at Princeton invented a rival formalism for functional abstraction, the lambda calculus, which proved more popular than combinatory logic. <b>The</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> these historical contingencies was that until theoretical computer science began taking an interest in combinatory logic in the 1960s and 1970s, nearly all work on the subject was by Haskell Curry and his students, or by Robert Feys in Belgium. Curry and Feys (1958), and Curry et al. (1972) survey the early history of combinatory logic. For a more modern treatment of combinatory logic and the lambda calculus together, see the book by Barendregt, which reviews the models Dana Scott devised for combinatory logic in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|General {{relativity}} is {{a theory}} of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing {{on the surface of}} the Earth) are physically identical. <b>The</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In 1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.|$|E
25|$|The British {{believed}} that Africaine was wrecked with all {{hands on the}} Charlestown bar. However, the truth was less tragic and more interesting in that it {{gave rise to a}} landmark legal case. The gale had cost Africaine her mizzenmast and 16 men swept overboard, as well as six guns that the crew had thrown overboard to lighten her, but she had reached Charleston bar in the evening of 3 May. It was low tide and although a pilot from Charleston had come aboard, she had to anchor and await high tide so that she could cross. Early on 4 May, the British privateer brig Garland, William Pindar, master, accompanied by a ship, came up and after firing a shot, caused Africaine to strike. Pindar then took Africaine into Charleston as his prize. The French commercial agent in Charlston, Jean Francis Soult, sued to have the vessel freed {{on the grounds that the}} capture had taken place within the territorial waters of the United States, a neutral party. In the case Jean Francis Soult v. Corvette L'Africaine, Judge Thomas Bee of the South Carolina District Court consulted maps and heard testimony, <b>the</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> which was that Garland had seized Africaine more than one league (three nautical miles or 3.452 miles) offshore, and hence outside U.S. territorial waters. The case established that territorial waters were to be measured from the low-tide line from the shore, with shoals completely under water not counting for the determination of shore or coast.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the new car led Holden to redesign the Elizabeth plant in South Australia so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production. This process {{is applied to the}} front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to the engine bay. This design represents the first time such a method has been used within GM, and garnered the SAE Australasia's 2006 Automotive Engineering Excellence Award. A modular design structure known within Holden as [...] "Flex Vision" [...] has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs. <b>The</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed: Functional, Performance and Luxury.

500|$|Boniface's {{doubts about}} the Libellus were revived {{in the twentieth century}} by several modern historians. In 1941 Suso Brechter made a study of the {{historical}} sources for Gregory the Great's Anglo-Saxon mission. In this study Brechter attempted to prove that the Libellus was an eighth-century forgery by Nothhelm. He believed that the Libellus contained too much that pertained specifically to eighth-century (rather than late sixth-century) theological concerns, i.e. the concerns of Nothhelm rather than Augustine. He argued that the forgery was completed in 731 and was foisted on Bede by Nothhelm in that year, making it a late insertion into Bede's Historia. Brechter's work did not attract much scholarly interest until 1959, when Margaret Deanesly and Paul Grosjean wrote a joint journal article refuting or modifying most of Brechter's arguments about the Libellus. Deanesly and Grosjean thought that Nothhelm had collected genuine Gregorian letters, added to them material relating to theological questions current at Canterbury, and presented the finished product (or dossier) to Bede as a [...] "Gregorian" [...] work: what we now know as the Libellus responsionum. They further argued that Nothhelm did this in two stages: a first stage that they named the Capitula version, which they considered was best exemplified by a manuscript now in Copenhagen; and a second version, which was rearranged in the form of questions paired with answers. In their view, this second version was the work sent to Bede by Nothhelm. <b>The</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> Deanesly and Grosjean's research was that the Libellus was quasi-authentic: while not a genuine work of Gregory I, it was nevertheless based extensively on authentic Gregorian writings.|$|E

50|$|A strong, universalizing impulse underscored Marie de l’Incarnation’s interactions, and {{activities}} in New France. Her perceptions of similarities between European Christians, {{and the potential}} converts in the New World were <b>the</b> <b>upshots</b> <b>of</b> a cloistered convent life, and largely non-existent experiences with other cultures; such seclusion allowed for an over-simplification of her ambition to spread God’s word transnationally. According to Natalie Zemon Davis, the integrative approach towards Native interactions that developed from this mindset was dissimilar to the Jesuit’s methods of establishing relationships in New France. Jesuits, adopted Native roles {{in the presence of}} First Nations peoples, but were quick to shed these association when outside the confines of their settlements; this double life made any fully integrative experience, or universal mindset impossible.|$|R

2500|$|In the calmer {{times after}} 1688, Londoners were again {{ready to be}} amused by stage performance, but the single [...] "United Company" [...] was not well {{prepared}} to offer it. No longer powered by competition, the company had lost momentum and {{been taken over by}} predatory investors ("Adventurers"), while management {{in the form of the}} autocratic Christopher Rich attempted to finance a tangle of [...] "farmed" [...] shares and sleeping partners by slashing actors' salaries. <b>The</b> <b>upshot</b> <b>of</b> this mismanagement was that the disgruntled actors set up their own co-operative company in 1695. A few years of re-invigorated two-company competition followed which allowed a brief second flowering of the drama, especially comedy.

If [...] "Restoration literature" [...] is the literature that reflects and reflects upon the court of Charles II, Restoration drama arguably ends before Charles II's death, as the playhouse moved rapidly from the domain of courtiers to the domain of the city middle classes. On the other hand, Restoration drama shows altogether more fluidity and rapidity than other types of literature, and so, even more than in other types of literature, its movements should never be viewed as absolute.
