5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe the device <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> {{of law that}} you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then {{a couple of people}} will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1790s, {{opposition}} {{political parties}} were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of traitors. Historian Ron Chernow reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington [...] "regarded {{much of the}} criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature." [...] When an undeclared Quasi-War broke out with France in 1797–98, [...] "Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole." [...] Furthermore, the Jeffersonian opposition party behaved the same way. After 1801, with a peaceful transition in the political party in power, the rhetoric of [...] "treason" [...] against political opponents diminished.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{thought by}} outsiders <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of rural adjunct to London, Sussex has a {{cultural}} identity as unique [...] {{as any other}} English county. [...] The last Anglo-Saxon kingdom to be Christianised, Sussex has a centuries-old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct {{from the rest of}} England. [...] This relative isolation until recent times is due to Sussex's geography, with the sea to the south, the forest and sticky clays of the Weald to the north and coastal marshes to the east and west. Sussex escaped the wholesale rearrangements of life and customs which the Norse invasions brought to much of England and the Germanic culture of the South Saxons remained much more intact than that of the rest of England. The people of Sussex have a reputation for independence of thought [...] and an aversion to being pushed around, as expressed through the Sussex motto, We wunt be druv. [...] The reputation for independence also extends to admiration of the independence of others and toleration of others. [...] Other regional characterisations include the sharp shrewd stubborn Sussex Wealdsman and the more deferential Sussex Downsman.|$|E
2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors in some way that facilitates mind-control. [...] Whatever this drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't know exactly what the drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, Harris says {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E
2500|$|Of the men {{who never}} returned, Wallace and Ewart were {{captured}} on 8 December at the Pointe de Grave (near Le Verdon) and revealed only certain information during their interrogation, and were executed under the Commando Order, on the night 11 December, in a sandpit in a wood north of Bordeaux and not at Chateau Magnol, Blanquefort. A plaque has been erected on the bullet marked wall at the Chateau, but {{the authenticity of the}} details on the plaque has been questioned; indeed given the evidence of a statement by a German officer who was at the execution {{there can be no doubt}} that the chateau has no link with Wallace and Ewart. A small memorial can also be seen at the Pointe de Grave, where they were captured. In March 2011 a €100,000 memorial was unveiled at this same spot. After the Royal Marines were executed by a naval firing squad, the Commander of the Navy Admiral Erich Raeder wrote in the Seekriegsleitung war diary that the executions of the captured Royal Marines were something [...] "new in international law, since the soldiers were wearing uniforms". The American historian Charles Thomas wrote that Raeder's remarks about the executions in the Seekriegsleitung war diary seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of ironic comment, which might have reflected a bad conscience on the part of Raeder.|$|E

60|$|From {{this state}} of repose, if it may be so called, he was {{partially}} aroused by the voices of men near him, talking in coarse, violent language. Raising his head languidly, he observed a band of about eight or ten villainous-looking fellows busy round a hole, out of which they appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawing <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of booty.|$|R
2500|$|Ward {{envisioned a}} planet whose {{interior}} was both wooden and archaic in design, where Luddite-like monks would take refuge. The story {{begins with a}} monk who sees a [...] "star in the East" [...] (Ripley's escape pod) and at first believes {{this to be a}} good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the Monks of the [...] "wooden satellite" [...] lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on {{the true nature of the}} beast. The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternate ending where the character survived, but eventually Sigourney Weaver said she would only do the movie if Ripley died.|$|E
2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot and {{directed}} by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, [...] "We're still {{trying to work out}} the date for the next video with [...] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, there has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not going to lie to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E
