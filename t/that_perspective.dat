5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E

25|$|Muslims, {{for their}} part, believe that {{parts of the}} Gospels, Torah and Jewish prophetic books have been forgotten, misinterpreted, or {{distorted}} by their followers. Based on <b>that</b> <b>perspective,</b> Muslims view the Qur'an as correcting the errors of Christianity. For example, Muslims reject belief in the Trinity, or any other expression of the divinity of Jesus, as incompatible with monotheism.|$|E

From the perspective of the South, British policy amounted to de facto support for the Union blockade and caused great frustration.|$|E
25|$|Photography and {{videography}} are the mainstays of recording, {{which has}} become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.|$|E

25|$|Between 1846 and 1903, the Catholic Church had {{experienced}} {{two of its}} longest pontificates in history up to that point. Together Pius IX and Leo XIII ruled {{for a total of}} 57 years. In 1914, the College of Cardinals chose della Chiesa at the young age of 59, indicating their desire for another long-lasting pontificate at the outbreak of World War I, which he labeled “the suicide of civilized Europe.” The war and its consequences were the main focus of Benedict XV. He immediately declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917. Both sides rejected his initiatives. German Protestants rejected any “Papal Peace” as insulting. The French politician Georges Clemenceau regarded the Vatican initiative as being anti-French. Having failed with diplomatic initiatives, Benedict XV focused on humanitarian efforts to lessen the impacts of the war, such as attending prisoners of war, the exchange of wounded soldiers and food deliveries to needy populations in Europe. After the war, he repaired the difficult relations with France, which re-established relations with the Vatican in 1921. During his pontificate, relations with Italy improved as well, as Benedict XV now permitted Catholic politicians led by Don Luigi Sturzo to participate in national Italian politics.|$|E

It is one of his few works that clearly engage with <b>that</b> <b>perspective.</b> Goffman's view on game theory was shaped by the works of Thomas Schelling. Goffman presents reality as a form of game, and discusses its rules and the various moves that players can make (the [...] "unwitting", the [...] "naive", the [...] "covering", the [...] "uncovering", and the [...] "counter-uncovering") while trying to get or hide an information.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese crew, which {{included}} producers Miyamoto, Kensuke Tanabe, Kenji Miki and designer and Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, communicated with the Texas-based studio through e-mails, telephone conferences and personal gatherings. The game was originally planned as having third-person perspective gameplay, but after Miyamoto intervened this {{was changed to}} first-person perspective and almost everything already developed was scrapped. The change from third-person perspective was prompted by camera problems experienced by Rare, which was developing the N64 game Jet Force Gemini. According to game director Mark Pacini, Miyamoto [...] "felt that shooting in third person was not very intuitive"; Pacini also said that exploration is easier using first-person. Pacini said that after picking <b>that</b> <b>perspective,</b> the crew decided {{not to make a}} traditional first-person shooter. He said, [...] "We weren't trying to fit in that genre. We had to break down the stereotypes of what a first-person game is and make a fun Metroid game.|$|E

He says <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> will affect your perception of the show. Those not already inundated with [...] "Type A personalities inside the Beltway" [...] in their daily lives may be drawn to the show. However, it is not likely a show that will serve well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with. After viewing the first two episodes, Stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall, describing it as [...] "the show's unwise narrative trope". The Wall Street Journal Smith defends the fourth wall as an [...] "artifice that generally works well here to loosen our bearings".|$|E

500|$|Fuse found Athena {{difficult}} to design, {{due to her}} being both an assistant to Phoenix and Apollo, and a strong-willed attorney who wants to prove her capabilities in court. He designed her hairstyle based on how she would be standing on the left of Phoenix or Apollo when assisting them, making sure that it looked good from <b>that</b> <b>perspective.</b> He also created the hairstyle {{to be able to}} convey Athena's enthusiasm and energy through its movements. He gave Athena the little gadget named Widget, that hangs around her neck, to visually represent the mood matrix. As they wanted other characters {{to be able to see}} the mood matrix, it was decided to make Widget project the mood matrix as a hologram. The mood matrix itself, which needed to represent people's mental state visually, was a challenge for the art team. They eventually decided to use the vastness of outer space and the Earth in the design, and ended up using a portable planetarium as the base motif. This also influenced the mood matrix background music, which Fuse described as having an [...] "outer space feel".|$|E
500|$|In January 2001, a United States {{federal appeals}} court upheld the {{dismissal}} of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be [...] "intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources." [...] In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had [...] "committed improper acts" [...] in the past, but also claimed that: [...] "allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, {{the result of the}} misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they [...] "provide a safe harbor for biased journalism". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: [...] "It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece".|$|E
500|$|However, the Expressionistic visual {{elements}} of the film are present {{not only in the}} main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether <b>that</b> <b>perspective</b> can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. As Brockmann writes, [...] "In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a [...] "dream logic of repetition" [...] that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.|$|E
