40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This letter responds to a Congressional request concerning our January 21, 2005, report Student Financial Aid: Need Determination Could Be Enhanced through Improvements in Education's Estimate of Applicants' State Tax Payments (GAO- 05 - 105). The Department of Education (Education) proposed an update {{to the state and}} other <b>tax</b> <b>allowance,</b> a part of the federal need analysis for student financial aid. Most federal aid, including Pell Grants and student loans, and some state and institutional aid are awarded based on a student's cost of attendance less the student's and/or family's ability to pay these costs [...] known as the expected family contribution (EFC). The <b>allowance,</b> which accounts <b>for</b> the amount of state and other nonfederal taxes paid by students and families, effectively reduces the EFC. Education proposed to update the allowance on the basis of information compiled by the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, specifically state and other taxes paid by taxpayers and reported on their federal income tax returns for tax year 2000. Our January 2005 report discussed (1) the factors that had affected the updating of the tax data on which the allowance is based, (2) the effects Education's proposed 2003 update would have had on financial assistance for student aid applicants for the 2004 - 2005 award year, (3) the limitations associated with the method used to derive the allowance, and (4) various strategies available to address the limitations. Although the proposed 2003 update to the state and other <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> did not take effect, shortly before we issued our report [...] on December 23, 2004 [...] Education updated the state and other <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> award year 2005 - 2006 on the basis of information compiled by SOI for tax year 2002, which was collected {{in the same manner as}} the tax year 2000 data. For this update, Education used the same methodology that was used for the proposed 2003 update. As of January 2005, Education has begun processing student aid applications for the 2005 - 2006 award year using the updated allowance. In light of Education's 2004 update of the state and other <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> award year 2005 - 2006, Congress asked us to update certain analyses included in our January 2005 report, which focused on Education's prior proposal. In particular, we determined how Education's update will affect, with respect to the 2005 - 2006 award year, (1) the state and other <b>tax</b> <b>allowance,</b> by state and dependency status; (2) the average EFC, by state; (3) eligibility for Pell Grants, by state, household income, and dependency status; (4) the amount of the average Pell Grant award, by state, household income, and dependency status; and (5) aggregate Pell Grant expenditures and overall student eligibility for Pell Grants. Congress also asked us to include the effects if Education had adopted one of the strategies discussed in our report for addressing the limitations associated with calculating the allowance. ...|$|R
30|$|Since direct {{income taxes}} {{are often the}} result of complex {{taxation}} systems, we disaggregate them into three components not {{all of which are}} necessarily present in all countries: <b>tax</b> schedules, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances,</b> and <b>tax</b> credits. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits are so-called fiscal benefits and they may be an important channel through which the tax benefit system directs resources towards households. A <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> is any type of deduction from initial taxable income that would lower the effective tax base. This includes social insurance contributions whenever they are deductible from the tax base, as well as any tax bands where the tax rate is zero. A tax credit is any type of non-refundable deduction from the initial tax liability (gross tax). To effect the decomposition we take following approach. First, using EUROMOD, we estimate the gross tax (i.e. before any tax credits) payable in the baseline scenario. We then re-calculate gross tax when all <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> in the system (including social insurance contributions when deductible, 0 rate bands etc.) are removed, i.e. set to zero. The difference between the gross taxes calculated in the two scenarios provides a measure of the ‘value’ of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each household, i.e. the amount of income each household gains via lower taxes due to the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances.</b> We measure the size of tax schedules as the gross tax that would be payable in the absence of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances.</b> The size of this variable is driven by the tax schedule but also by other elements of the income tax system such as the extent to which various types of incomes are subject to taxation, joint vs. individual taxation, progressivity adjustments etc. In the remainder of the paper we will refer to the tax schedule/taxable base component of the income tax system as “taxes”. Finally, tax credits are the difference between gross and net taxes. Refundable tax credits are treated as benefits and thus included in the benefit concepts, not in tax credits, as explained above.|$|R

There is no inexorable development path though, either within or across countries. A layering development pattern suggests that analysis of family policy over time needs to be oriented to examining both continuity and change and, as the conclusion makes clear, there are many fruitful lines of further research...|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{system of}} {{economic}} support {{for those on}} low incomes and for families is among the least effective in Europe. Its incoherent nature is shown by very large jumps in implicit marginal tax rates (taxation + family benefits). Italy needs a comprehensive reform of the treatment of income for tax and social welfare purposes. This paper proposes {{a new system of}} benefits and taxation for Italy based on a discussion of the theoretical properties of different schemes for integrating taxation and family benefits. The proposal combines <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> work, designed to provide incentives to work, a flat rate family benefit and changes in the structure of tax rates which would incorporate the progressivity that is implicit in the current system of family benefits. The proposed system exhibits some of the characteristics of social dividend and negative income tax schemes.

40|$|Direct {{government}} aid and fiscal incentives {{for research and}} development each have distinctive advantages and disadvantages. An appropriate mix adjusted to prevailing conditions may increase the efficiency of the system of {{government aid}}. As a matter of fact, the majority of OECD countries provides support to R&D both through direct subsidies and, increasingly, by means of tax incentives. At present the EU is paying greater attention to fiscal incentives for R&D than in the past. For a considerable period of time, Austria has been offering an instrument of fiscal aid to R&D – the R&D <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> – which is rather generous by international standards. In its present form, however, the R&D <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> shows some weak points. A reform of fiscal aid for R&D, presently in the stage of a draft amendment of the income tax law, is designed to eliminate some of these weaknesses by additional measures (a new R&D <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> R&D expenditure based on the OECD definition, an R&D premium for firms that do not manage to make sufficient profit). This reform of tax incentives for R&D does not leave any firm worse off than before. On the other hand, however, it means that the set of instruments is becoming increasingly complex, and that in turn the costs of administration and compliance by firms tend to increase. Moreover, for the purpose of marketing Austria as a good business location, an easily understandable design of tax incentives would be preferable. Up to now the actual use and effects of the R&D <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> have not been very transparent and no evaluation has been presented so far. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the transparency of fiscal aid for R&D and to evaluate the newly designed set of instruments according to international standards after they have been in use for three years.
