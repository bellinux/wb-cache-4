Infusion of the alpha (2 A) -adrenoceptor antagonist BRL 44408, or the alpha (1) -adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline into <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> or PFC caused a similar dose-dependent increase in both structures.

25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. <b>The</b> <b>LCD</b> panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of <b>the</b> <b>LCD</b> panel at the factory level.

40|$|Glaucoma is an optic {{neuropathy}} {{that is the}} second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The disease is characterized by damage to the retinal ganglion cells, resulting in irreversible vision loss. While the exact pathogenesis remains unclear, damage due to glaucoma is believed to first occur at <b>the</b> lamina cribrosa (<b>LC),</b> a collagenous meshwork in the optic nerve head through which all retinal ganglion cell axons pass {{on their way to}} the brain. The mechanical theory of glaucoma postulates that elevated intraocular pressure deforms <b>the</b> <b>LC,</b> leading to a biological cascade resulting in retinal ganglion cell death. However, the interaction between intraocular pressure and glaucoma is complex; a substantial heterogeneity exists in the intraocular pressure at which a given patient experiences glaucoma. Recent studies have identified that perhaps intracranial pressure, which acts posterior to <b>the</b> <b>LC,</b> may play an important role in the disease process. Given the complex 3 D microstructure of <b>the</b> <b>LC,</b> in vivo studies thus far have been limited to assessment of changes in its surface. However, because the axons are traversing through the entire volume of <b>the</b> <b>LC,</b> <b>the</b> axonal damage can occur at any level of <b>the</b> <b>LC,</b> rather than only at its surface. Therefore, full understanding of the damage caused by glaucoma requires systematic characterization of <b>the</b> 3 D <b>LC</b> microstructure. In order to better characterize <b>the</b> 3 D <b>LC</b> microstructure, we demonstrate here a novel automated 3 D LC segmentation method that is reproducible and capable of accurately detecting <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> microstructural component. Using our segmentation analysis, we find in a primate model that <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> microstructure deforms according to both intraocular pressure as well as intracranial pressure, with significant interaction between the two. We then move to the translational aspect of our study to characterize <b>the</b> healthy <b>LC</b> in human eyes and identify a number of structural and biomechanical differences in <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> microstructure compared to glaucoma eyes. Our findings demonstrate that a novel automated 3 D assessment of <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> microstructure is capable of 1) identifying in vivo difference in <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> microstructure and LC biomechanics in glaucoma eyes and 2) improving our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis...|$|R

To investigate a possible tonic activation of LC neurons by alpha(1) -adrenoceptor, the alpha(1) -antagonist prazosin (10 mu M) was infused into <b>the</b> <b>LC.</b> Extracellular noradrenaline in <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> decreased to about 50 % of basal levels but no change of noradrenaline release was detected in the ipsilateral PFC.

Local administration of the a-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (100 mu M) into <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> increased <b>the</b> noradrenaline release in <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> to about 400 %, whereas noradrenaline release in the PFC rose to 150 % of basal levels.

When infusions of idazoxan (100 mu M) or BRL 44408 (10 mu M) into <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> were combined with prazosin (10 mu M), the excitatory effects of the alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonists on the release of noradrenaline were strongly suppressed in <b>the</b> <b>LC</b> {{as well as in}} the ipsilateral PFC.
