Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>even</b> used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|Charles' abdication had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences in}} imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>even</b> prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant ebb and flow of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{took part}} in a tournament held to {{celebrate}} Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there, otherwise <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>even</b> suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary's regime. In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands, and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip's return to England. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for PhilipII at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557. Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball—according to Robert, before his own eyes. All surviving Dudley children—Ambrose and Robert with their sisters Mary and Katherine—were restored in blood by Mary I's next parliament in 1558.|$|E

25|$|After the Conquest, the art {{of working}} with {{feathers}} survived, but on a lesser scale and its uses changed.

However, even more significant were the engine modifications, which increased power to 625hp; no torque or RPM figures were given. Along with the carbon fiber hardtop, a front splitter and rear spoiler were added; however those parts were not nearly as significant as those on the later SRT-10 ACR, and no downforce/drag information was provided to show that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>even</b> functional.

He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>even</b> in the highest political circles.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} janissaries, in 1389 the Ottoman army {{introduced}} {{a system of}} conscription: when needed, every town and village were obliged to provide a fully equipped conscript at the recruiting office created by {{the order of the}} Sultan.

The Başıbozuk, who were also called Delibaş ("crazy head"), were a branch of the azabs and were especially recruited among the homeless and criminals.

25|$|In December 2010, {{organizers}} {{announced that}} they had reached a deal with BYU {{to play in the}} 2013 edition of the Fight Hunger Bowl. The Cougars, who became conference independent during the 2011 season, were scheduled to fill a slot originally allotted to a team from the Western Athletic Conference, which discontinued football prior to the 2013 season. After defeating the Boise State Broncos for their sixth win of the season on October 25, bowl director Gary Cavalli extended an invitation to play in the game. Cavalli stated in 2010 that he had been hoping to secure the Cougars' participation in the game since 2002. If the Cougars did not earn enough wins to become bowl eligible, an alternate team from the Atlantic Coast Conference would have replaced them; though they finished bowl eligible, one ESPN writer opined <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>even</b> better than their record indicated.|$|E
