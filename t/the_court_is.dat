5|$|The first duty of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> to {{determine}} whether the amendment was intended to be consistent with the intentions of Parliament in passing the original Act. Only if <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> satisfied {{if that is the case}} may it read them as one.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 1865, the Law on the Organization of <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>was</b> passed, and <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> {{organized}} into <b>the</b> district <b>courts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of appeal and <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation. According to <b>the</b> Law, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation had three chambers. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> composed of 15 judges, {{one of them}} being the president. The judges were appointed by the Prince through a decree. The Law gave <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation <b>the</b> power of judicial interpretation instead of the Minister of Justice. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> still under <b>the</b> Government's influence, but the judicial independence was constantly strengthening.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Squash <b>Courts</b> <b>were</b> once lit {{by natural}} light, but the former roof {{has now been}} {{replaced}} by a mezzanine ceiling. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> an excellent example of early squash <b>courts.</b> <b>The</b> balcony <b>is</b> particularly noteworthy as <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> designed in back to back format which is quite rare.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Palace <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> held weekly {{together}} with <b>the</b> ancient <b>Court</b> of Marshalsea. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> abolished in 1849.|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} heard {{by a panel}} of the Prague Municipal Court, {{consisting}} of presiding professional judge Tomáš Kubovec and two lay judges. Trials in the Czech Republic are public. In general, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> bound to decide on the deed as stated in the indictment; however, it is not bound by its legal assessment by the State Attorney.|$|E
5|$|The county {{maintains}} a {{small claims court}} that can handle some civil cases. The judge on <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> elected to a {{term of four years}} and must {{be a member of the}} Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.|$|E
5|$|Thomas A. Balmer is {{the most}} senior of the seven justices, {{starting}} service in 2001. The newest member of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> Meagan Flynn, who joined the court in 2017. Five of the seven justices first joined the court as appointees of the Governor of Oregon to fill mid-term vacancies.|$|E
50|$|On July 2, 2003 <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> again restructured. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> {{split into}} two {{separate}} <b>Courts,</b> with <b>the</b> Trial Division continued as <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> and <b>the</b> Appeal Division continued as <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{created with}} nine judges: one three-judge panel {{for each of}} three districts. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> later expanded to fifteen judges (five districts, each with one three judge panel).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>were</b> reorganized and <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> made an {{elective}} body. Their terms were extended to seven years.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the series, Blackadder's chief rival is Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry), the Queen's pretentious and grovelling Lord Chamberlain. Melchett {{is himself}} {{in fear of}} {{upsetting}} the Queen, and thus attempts to outdo Blackadder by supporting the Queen in whatever current fad she is interested in. Comic relief in <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> provided by the Queen's rather demented former nanny, Nursie (Patsy Byrne).|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} 1936, {{and was given}} {{temporary}} accommodation in Skien, with <b>the</b> <b>court</b> room in <b>the</b> city hall. By 1991 <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> located at three different places in the city, before the current Tønsberg Courthouse was opened.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{created on}} July 2, 2003, by <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> Administration Service Act when it and <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> <b>were</b> split from its predecessor, <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> a {{superior}} <b>court</b> and {{a court of}} record. Judges appointed by the Governor-General constituted it as required. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> permitted to sit anywhere in Australia as the interests of justice required, and was confined to hearing a case on the island. When hearing criminal cases, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> sat with a jury to determine an accused person’s guilt. If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> sat outside <b>the</b> island, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> could use jurors from the State or Territory that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> actually sitting at.|$|R
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{justice of}} <b>the</b> peace <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> managed by <b>the</b> Scottish <b>Courts</b> and Tribunals Service. Responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred}} from <b>the</b> local authorities in a rolling programme of court unification that concluded in February 2010. <b>The</b> district <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> replaced by justice of <b>the</b> peace <b>courts</b> as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} <b>court</b> <b>is</b> No. 1 <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1997 to replace <b>the</b> old No.1 <b>Court,</b> which <b>was</b> adjacent to Centre <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> old No.1 <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> demolished because its capacity for spectators <b>was</b> too low. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> said {{to have had a}} unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. <b>The</b> new No.1 <b>Court</b> has a capacity of approximately 11,000.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> {{expanded}} to five justices each serving for ten years. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> again expanded in 1903 to eight justices serving terms of eight-years. In 1964, {{the new state}} constitution set the number of justices on <b>the</b> <b>court</b> at seven.|$|R
5|$|The Court of the Eurasian Economic Union {{replaced}} the Court of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC Court) in 2015. It {{is in charge}} of dispute resolution and the interpretation of the legal order within the Eurasian Economic Union. Its headquarters is in Minsk. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> composed of two judges from each member state, appointed by the heads of government of the member states. Their term of office is nine years.|$|E
5|$|The Pitched Stone Court {{forms the}} {{north-east}} {{corner of the}} castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it {{takes its name from}} the late-Tudor cobbling, or pitched stones. On the east side of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.|$|E
5|$|The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri {{is a trial}} level federal {{district}} court based in St. Louis, Missouri, with jurisdiction over fifty counties in {{the eastern half of}} Missouri. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> one of ninety-four district-level courts which make up the first tier of the U.S. federal judicial system. Judges of this court preside over civil and criminal trials on federal matters that originate within the borders of its jurisdiction. It is organized into three divisions, with court held in St. Louis, Hannibal, and Cape Girardeau.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} <b>court</b> <b>is</b> No. 1 <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1997 to replace <b>the</b> old No.1 <b>Court,</b> which <b>was</b> adjacent to Centre <b>Court.</b> [...] <b>The</b> old No.1 <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> demolished because its capacity for spectators <b>was</b> too low. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>was</b> said {{to have had a}} unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. <b>The</b> new No.1 <b>Court</b> has a capacity of approximately 11,000.|$|R
5|$|In November 2010 Vera Hughes {{opened the}} two newly {{refurbished}} Rackets <b>courts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> named {{after her husband}} Ron Hughes who was the Rackets Professional at Malvern from 1956 until 1986 <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> now both tournament quality.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>the</b> Australian Industrial <b>Court</b> in 1973. In 1977 the {{jurisdiction}} of <b>the</b> Australian Industrial <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Australia.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of seven elected justices, {{each of whom}} serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be United States citizens, Oregon residents {{for at least three}} years, and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon. The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed “the broom closet”) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position. To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This {{is illustrated by the}} High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> responsible for deciding if the precedent fact has been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E
5|$|The entire Court takes part in {{the annual}} Judicial Conference of Indiana, which is {{attended}} {{by all of the}} state's judges, and recommends improvements to the Court and state judiciary. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for implementing all laws passed by the Indiana General Assembly that affect the judiciary. The Division of Supreme Court Administration is staffed by clerks who oversee the fiscal management of the courts, including payroll and expenses. In addition, the division is responsible for maintaining the Court's records and assists in its administrative functions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> not {{obliged to}} {{determine}} whether the communications in the present case were “offensive” for the purposes of s 417.12. The sole question before <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> whether s 417.12 infringed the implied freedom and was so invalid.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue before}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> whether <b>the</b> appeal <b>court</b> <b>was</b> correct in holding s.213(a) as a {{violation}} of ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.|$|R
50|$|Despite South Africa's {{division}} into nine provinces, {{the country}} has a single national <b>court</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> funded {{and supported by the}} national Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. <b>The</b> ordinary <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> district and regional magistrates' <b>courts,</b> <b>the</b> provincial divisions of <b>the</b> High <b>Court,</b> and <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Appeal. <b>The</b> Constitutional <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>court</b> for constitutional matters.|$|R
