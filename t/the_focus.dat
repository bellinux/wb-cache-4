40|$|Motivated by {{a recent}} {{experiment}} on acoustic lenses, we perform numerical calculations based on a multiple scattering technique to investigate <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> of acoustic waves with sonic crystals formed by rigid cylinders in air. <b>The</b> <b>focusing</b> effects for crystals of various shapes are examined. The dependance of <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> length on <b>the</b> filling factor is also studied. It is observed that both the shape and filling factor {{play a crucial role}} in controlling <b>the</b> <b>focusing.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> robustness of <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> against disorders is studied. The results show that the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> behavior depends on the strength of positional disorders.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a focusing-by-vergence system combining a flow based vergence process with an off-line pre-calibration of <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> odometry. <b>The</b> vergence process {{is controlled by}} the retinal optical flow disparity and the target depth velocity is directly obtained from this disparity. The relationship between <b>the</b> target depth (<b>focused</b> target distance) and <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> odometry of <b>the</b> motorized lens is obtained by an off-line focusing calibration, using a bivariate polynomial to model de relationship between these parameters. <b>The</b> <b>focusing</b> system is velocity controlled and <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> velocity is dependent on <b>the</b> target <b>focusing</b> depth velocity and the focal distance velocity. The influence of the focal distance velocity that arise due to <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> process itself is compensated by the adjustment of the zoom parameter based on a constant magnification approach, or through the modeling of the focal distance as a function of <b>the</b> zoom and <b>focus</b> lens settings. 1 Introductio [...] ...|$|R
