40|$|China's {{accession}} to the WTO represents a goal achieved after nearly {{fifteen years of}} exhausting negotiations. However, many legal, political and social problems {{have not yet been}} tackled in terms of achieving real implementation of WTO provisions throughout the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Protocol requires a general and deep application of transparency, which will radically influence and change the Chinese legal system. There are a wide range of transparency related problems such as the formal publication of laws and regulations, procedural fairness in decision-making, the judicial review and the non-discrimination principle. The special precautionary instrument, the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (TRM), was included in the Protocol of China's Accession to the WTO, as requested by the US and supported by the EU. The TRM has the objective of monitoring and enforcement of implementation of WTO commitments, promoting transparency and the exchange of information in trade relations with China. Bilateral engagements and multilateral forums are both essential to bring China into full compliance with its WTO commitments. ...|$|E

As part of our long-term body of work related to China's membership in the WTO, we reported in October 2004 on how the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the Departments of Commerce, State, and Agriculture were positioned to monitor and enforce China's compliance with its WTO commitments in 2003. In that report, we examined the multilateral annual WTO review of China's progress, referred to as the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (TRM). We found that the TRM has ongoing limitations in its participation and its procedures. We made recommendations to improve related U. S. government activities. In a subsequent request, Congress asked us to provide detailed information about the TRM process in 2003 so that they could better gauge the level of activity and the efficacy of the United States and other WTO members' efforts to utilize it. ...|$|E
40|$|China's {{accession}} to the WTO represents a goal achieved after nearly {{fifteen years of}} exhausting negotiations. A special precautionary instrument, the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (TRM), {{was included in the}} Protocol of China's Accession to the WTO, as requested by the US and supported by the EU. The TRM has the objective of monitoring and enforcement of implementation of WTO commitments, promoting transparency and the exchange of information in trade relations with China. China is lowering the expectations of some of the WTO members for the outcome of the TRM. It follows that the WTO members' participation in the review had declined in favour of bilateral negotiations which result in the best means to overcome many problems in China's WTO compliance. It is necessary to try to understand if there are comprehensive and justifiable reasons for China to delegitimize the multilateral system at the WTO in general and in the TRM context. According to some scholars, the general Chinese behaviour not in favour of the TRM could be explained with reference to the Chinese cultural tradition, where the best way to resolve the disputes was through mediation and conciliation. China is a high-context society, where the central role is played by collective entities and groups and not by individuals. A key element in the Chinese mentality (such as in other Asian, Middle East and South American countries) is the concept of preserving group harmony and maintaining one's public image. The best behaviour is to try to avoid any direct confrontation, such as bringing a lawsuit. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a large scale {{comparison}} of how implementation <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (IRMs) are used in international environmental agreements. Broadly, IRMs are the means by which data is exchanged and gathered, reviewed and assessed {{in the context of an}} international agreement, and by which problems of compliance and inadequate performance are managed. Here we describe the data protocol that is being used in assembing a database of <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and explain the rationale behind all the major questions in the protocol. The protocol consists of questions about the general features of agreements as well as more focussed questions concerning: how information relating to national performance and compliance is gathered and disseminated; how that information is assessed; and the means by which the parties and the agreement respond to potential problems of noncompliance and inadequate performance. The database is useful in part because it organizes information about different international environmental agreements into a comparable format and thus aids in the selection of appropriate cases and comparisons for further research. It is also useful because it can aid in the testing of hypotheses about which aspects of international agreements and <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> lead agreements to be more effective. We are now using it for both purposes, in addition to extending the number of cases in the database. To date, over fifty cases have been coded using the protocol. Here we also report some observations and hypotheses derived from working with the data from those cases. These include: 1) a hypothesis that <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> tend to grow as needed to fulfill demand for specific functions; 2) a hypothesis that <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> might help the parties to an agreement address various forms of complexity that arise in negotiating and managing international agreements; 3) a questions as to whether and how often institutions that are formally outside a particular agreement but with competence or power in the issue-area de facto provide the <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the agreement; 4) a question as to whether <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> make their largest contribution to effectiveness when the obligations of an agreement are precise or vague; 5) a question as to whether in practice some of the functions of <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are performed by dispute resolution mechanisms, which tend to be formally created in most international agreements (but appear to be rarely used in environmental agreements). ...|$|R

40|$|Statutory {{adjudication}} {{was introduced}} in the security of payment legislation to quickly and fairly resolve payment disputes in the construction industry. One of the interesting features in some legislation is the availability of an express limited right of aggrieved parties to apply for review against erroneous adjudication decisions. In Singapore, the legislation has no equivalent elsewhere in that it provides for a full <b>review</b> <b>mechanism</b> of erroneous determinations considering the fact that adjudicators often have to grapple with complex issues as sheer volume of documents within a very tight timeframe. This paper discusses the various <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of erroneous adjudication determinations then asks the question as to whether an appropriately devised legislative <b>review</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the merits, should be an essential characteristic of any effective statutory adjudication scheme. The paper concludes by making the case that an appropriately designed <b>review</b> <b>mechanism</b> as proposed in the paper could be the most pragmatic and effective measure {{to improve the quality of}} adjudication outcome and increase the disputants 2 ̆ 7 confidence in statutory adjudication.

At such a vote held on April 10, 2016 at the NDP's federal convention held in Edmonton, Alberta, incumbent leader Thomas Mulcair lost a leadership review vote when only 48% of delegates supported his continued leadership.|$|R

40|$|Statutory {{adjudication}} {{has been}} enacted progressively throughout Australia on a stat-by-state basis {{over a period}} of 10 years. The legislation with more emphasis on the Eastern States has come under much criticism recently for failing to facilitate decisions of sufficient quality with respect to complex adjudications. This paper reviews this criticism and discusses the key causes of the unsatisfactory outcome of complex adjudications in Australia. The identified causes are namely flawed appointment, relaxed eligibility and regulation, intimidation of adjudicators, fuzzy jurisdictional boundaries, abbreviated timeframes, limited inquisitorial powers and want of <b>review</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The implication of the research is {{a better understanding of the}} nature of the quality of complex adjudication outcome and the relevant worthwhile reform opportunities in Australia, especially with regard to introducing legislative <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
