30|$|Several {{strategies}} {{can be used}} to avoid or minimize these types of problems. First, it is important to monitor the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b> Even ongoing programs should be subject to implementation studies so that policy makers know what is being evaluated and if it has changed over time.

40|$|Like inter-group {{violence}} (Chapter 7) and insurgency (Chapter 8), {{crime and}} cor-ruption are nearly inevitable companions {{of an international}} intervention. Both contribute to the reasons why <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>occurs,</b> and both may even grow and fester as side-effects of an intervention. Moreover, crime and corruption fre-quently serve as obstacles to a successful termination of an intervention. High crime rates and frequent incidents of corruption {{are some of the}} main in-dicators and drivers of failed states, {{as well as some of}} the most important im-pediments to economic development (Frisch 1996, p. 68). A failed state cannot en-force laws against crime because the state itself is ridden with the crime of corruption, so much so that law enforcement is seen as unfair and illegitimate (The Fund for Peace 2008). Corruption is a particular type of crime that erodes the abil-ity of the state to enforce the law or perform other functions. A widely cited defi-nition of corruption is a “behavior which deviates from the formal duties of a pub-lic role because of private-regarding (personal, close family, private clique) pecuniary or status gains; or violates rules against the exercise of certain private...|$|E
30|$|Based {{on these}} findings, it is {{possible}} to propose some considerations regarding the SST with men and women crack users. It is emphasized that the assessment of social skills should support the planning of the intervention. In addition to self-report instruments, behavior observations may complement the assessment. According to the results of this study, the emphasis of SSI in women should be in deficit factors of social skills. Moreover, it is necessary to identify the skills in which there is greater ease, for example, the expression of positive feelings, to be the first skill to be worked on at SST so that <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>occurs</b> in ascending order of difficulty (Del Prette & Del Prette, 2014). Specific skills like dealing with parent’s criticism and with offensive mockery or games should also be worked on, because they relate to the difficulties of such women in the expression of negative feelings and unpleasantness and can be characterized as a risk factor for relapse in drug use (Limberger et al. 2016; Limberger & Andretta, in press). In this perspective, it is also relevant to develop skills to deal with criticism, since this is a risk factor for relapse. Considering the social stigma and low self-esteem in women crack users, {{it is important that the}} treatments include the learning of defense of rights skills for greater autonomy in the social reinsertion process (Kuri et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Quality {{improvement}} and implementation (QI&I) initiatives face critical challenges {{in an era}} of evidence-based, value-driven patient care. Whether front-line staff, large organisations or government bodies design and run QI&I, there is increasing need to demonstrate impact to justify investment of time and resources in implementing and scaling up an intervention. Decisions about sustaining, scaling up and spreading an initiative can be informed by evidence of causation and the estimated attributable effect of an intervention on observed outcomes. Achieving this in healthcare can be challenging, where interventions often are multimodal and applied in complex systems. 1 Where there is weak evidence of causation, credibility in the effectiveness of the intervention is reduced with a resultant reduced desire to replicate. The greater confidence of a causal relationship between QI&I interventions and observed results, the greater our confidence that improvement will result when <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>occurs</b> in different settings. Guidance exists for design, conduct, evaluation and reporting of QI&I initiatives; 2 – 4; the Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) and the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (STARI) guidelines were developed specifically for reporting QI&I initiatives. 5 6 However, much of this guidance is targeted at larger formal evaluations, and may require levels of resource or expertise not available to all QI&I initiatives. This paper proposes QI&I initiatives, regardless of scope and resources, can be enhanced by applying epidemiological principles, adapted from those promulgated by Austin Bradford Hill. ...|$|E

Stable depletion of CD 151 in the MDA-MB- 231 (MDA- 231) cell line, changed the glycosylation profile of α 3 β 1, but not α 6 β 1 /β 4 integrins. Glycosylation of CD 151, tight association between CD 151 and α 3 β 1 integrin and recruitment into tetraspanin enriched microdomains (TERM) are all required for this effect and <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>occurs</b> during the first mannose trimming step within the ER. Further analysis showed that CD 151 preferentially associates with α 3 β 1 over α 6 β 1 /β 4. CD 151 mediated changes to glycosylation of α 3 β 1 integrin decreased their ability to migrate towards Lm 332 by ~ 90 %. Sucrose density gradient assays showed α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 1 /β 4 are recruited by CD 151 into the light fractions {{as part of a}} TERM as well as separate entities. Glyco-analysis of the tetraspanins themselves showed CD 9 and possibly CD 63 and CD 82 to be phospho-mannosylated. Castanospermine treatment dramatically reduced the level of CD 151, α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 1 /β 4 in these cells, indicating a novel therapeutic use. Depletion of various tetraspanins in MDA- 231 altered their cell surface glycotope presentation and the cleavage profile of α 6 β 1 /β 4 integrin; highlighting the role played by tetraspanins in post-translational modification of their partners.
